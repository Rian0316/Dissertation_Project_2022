178
00:10:12,400 --> 00:10:17,520
because when we were your age,
some of us were having sex.

179
00:10:17,600 --> 00:10:20,840
- [pupils chuckling]
- In fact, many of us still have sex.

180
00:10:21,960 --> 00:10:27,320
I'm sure even Headmaster Groff
sometimes has sex.

181
00:10:28,280 --> 00:10:32,360
And so, I would like you to tell me

182
00:10:32,440 --> 00:10:37,080
what you would like
on your sex education curriculum.

183
00:10:38,320 --> 00:10:40,240
Take control.

184
00:10:40,320 --> 00:10:42,200
[microphone feedback]

185
00:10:46,360 --> 00:10:50,480
Perhaps you'd like to know about
the female orgasm...

186
00:10:50,560 --> 00:10:51,400
[laughter]

187
00:10:51,480 --> 00:10:54,360
...or mutual masturbation.

188
00:10:54,440 --> 00:10:56,360
[laughter]

189
00:10:56,440 --> 00:10:59,320
[Jean] Or maybe you've always wondered,

190
00:10:59,400 --> 00:11:03,040
is my labia a normal length?

191
00:11:03,760 --> 00:11:05,680
[laughing]

192
00:11:11,560 --> 00:11:13,480
What I'm saying is...

193
00:11:19,920 --> 00:11:22,920
<i>- ♪ Let's talk about sex, baby ♪</i>
- [audience groans]

194
00:11:23,000 --> 00:11:25,960
<i>♪ Let's talk about you and me ♪</i>

195
00:11:26,040 --> 00:11:28,480
Didn't you wank off a courgette?

196
00:11:28,560 --> 00:11:30,080
[audience laughing]

197
00:11:30,160 --> 00:11:32,240
[audience chanting] Courgette! Courgette!

198
00:11:32,320 --> 00:11:34,200
Courgette! Courgette!

199
00:11:34,280 --> 00:11:36,160
Courgette! Courgette!

200
00:11:36,240 --> 00:11:38,320
Courgette! Courgette!

201
00:11:38,400 --> 00:11:40,400
Courgette! Courgette!

202
00:11:40,480 --> 00:11:41,760
Anyway...

203
00:11:41,840 --> 00:11:42,920
[laughing]

204
00:11:43,000 --> 00:11:45,920
...there will be an empty box
at reception.

205
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:48,560
If you have any questions,
it is anonymous,

206
00:11:48,640 --> 00:11:51,400
so put anything in there
that you would like to see

207
00:11:51,920 --> 00:11:54,000
- in the curriculum.
- Courgette wanker!

208
00:11:54,080 --> 00:11:55,280
[audience laughing]

209
00:11:59,680 --> 00:12:02,240
[Mr. Groff] Thank you very much, Moordale.

210
00:12:02,320 --> 00:12:06,080
I'm sure we would like
to say thank you to Ms., uh...

211
00:12:06,160 --> 00:12:08,520
Forgive me, Dr. Milburn, for her...

212
00:12:08,600 --> 00:12:11,200
I don't understand why
everyone is laughing at this nice lady.

213
00:12:11,280 --> 00:12:12,160
Uh, uh...

214
00:12:12,240 --> 00:12:13,880
Because it's high school. [laughs]

215
00:12:13,960 --> 00:12:17,760
[Mr. Groff] ...happening this evening,
um, available at all prices.

216
00:12:17,840 --> 00:12:19,560
- Please be careful...
- I'm Rahim.

217
00:12:19,640 --> 00:12:20,840
...nut allergies...

218
00:12:20,920 --> 00:12:22,600
Uh, I'm Eric.

219
00:12:22,680 --> 00:12:23,960
...said issues...

220
00:12:24,040 --> 00:12:25,200
Goodbye, Eric.

221
00:12:27,720 --> 00:12:28,600
Bye.

222
00:12:28,680 --> 00:12:32,240
...nice place to go. I highly recommend
you, uh, you sign up to that.

223
00:12:32,320 --> 00:12:33,360
What was that?

224
00:12:40,960 --> 00:12:44,600
- Ah. Emily, howdy.
- Good morning, Mr. Hendricks.

225
00:12:47,520 --> 00:12:50,400
Now I see where you get
your terrible sex therapy skills from.

226
00:12:56,640 --> 00:12:58,640
Fancy putting in a question? [chuckles]

227
00:12:58,720 --> 00:12:59,960
[laughs]

228
00:13:00,040 --> 00:13:02,160
No. Nay. Thank you.

229
00:13:02,240 --> 00:13:03,280
Um... [chuckles]

230
00:13:03,360 --> 00:13:06,080
I'm usually the person who answers
the awkward questions.

231
00:13:06,160 --> 00:13:08,120
- I'm Colin Hendricks.
- Oh...

232
00:13:08,200 --> 00:13:10,680
- You're the SRE teacher.
- Yes.

233
00:13:10,760 --> 00:13:11,920
[Jean] Mr. Groff?

234
00:13:13,640 --> 00:13:18,400
I'd really like to observe
one of Colin's SRE classes, please.

235
00:13:18,480 --> 00:13:22,600
As I keep saying Ms. Milburn,
our curriculum is quite satisfactory.

236
00:13:22,680 --> 00:13:24,440
Well, if it's as...

237
00:13:25,040 --> 00:13:27,880
satisfactory as you keep saying,
then you won't mind

238
00:13:27,960 --> 00:13:29,640
if I sit in on one of the classes.

239
00:13:30,800 --> 00:13:32,400
Of course not. [clears throat]

240
00:13:32,480 --> 00:13:34,760
But I'm sure that any questions
that appear in this box

241
00:13:34,840 --> 00:13:38,240
will very easily be answered
by Mr. Hendricks, isn't that right, Colin?

242
00:13:38,320 --> 00:13:39,400
Uh...

243
00:13:39,480 --> 00:13:40,480
Absolutely.

244
00:13:41,080 --> 00:13:42,920
Yes. Yes.

245
00:13:43,000 --> 00:13:45,280
I am, um, I'm-I'm a master of sex.

246
00:13:48,400 --> 00:13:49,640
Very good.

247
00:13:54,160 --> 00:13:55,000
Good day.

248
00:13:59,000 --> 00:13:59,840
[door closes]

249
00:13:59,920 --> 00:14:01,920
[Mr. Groff]
The school is right behind you, Jackson.

250
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:05,560
We will do everything in our power
to support your speedy recovery.

251
00:14:06,560 --> 00:14:07,560
Thank you, sir.

252
00:14:08,160 --> 00:14:12,240
However, your parents and I feel
it would be in your best interest

253
00:14:12,320 --> 00:14:15,440
to be paired with an academic tutor
for the rest of term.

254
00:14:15,520 --> 00:14:16,360
A peer.

255
00:14:16,440 --> 00:14:18,160
But my... my grades are fine.

256
00:14:18,240 --> 00:14:22,000
Well, you can get by on fine
when you're a star in the pool,

257
00:14:22,080 --> 00:14:25,800
but when you're not... you have to work
as hard as everybody else.

258
00:14:27,840 --> 00:14:30,120
Good morning, brains of the future.

259
00:14:30,520 --> 00:14:33,800
I'm very happy to welcome Maeve Wiley
to the program.

260
00:14:34,200 --> 00:14:36,320
Make her feel at home, please.

261
00:14:37,120 --> 00:14:38,440
All right.

262
00:14:38,520 --> 00:14:41,480
Let's read out our ten-years'-time essays.

263
00:14:41,920 --> 00:14:43,520
[whispers] We have to read them out loud?

264
00:14:44,720 --> 00:14:46,080
[Emily] Who wants to go first?

265
00:14:48,480 --> 00:14:50,640
I strive for excellence
in everything I do.

266
00:14:50,720 --> 00:14:54,160
The points I gain
from my extracurricular activities

267
00:14:54,240 --> 00:14:56,560
will earn me a place in Oxbridge
where I will...

268
00:14:56,640 --> 00:15:00,240
Compete in the IFBB
Bodybuilding Championships whilst...

269
00:15:00,320 --> 00:15:03,360
Keeping me on track to become
the Prime Minister of the United Kingdom

270
00:15:03,440 --> 00:15:04,960
by the age of 30, which will...

271
00:15:05,040 --> 00:15:09,080
Land me an Erasmus scholarship
to NYU Film and Television School

272
00:15:09,560 --> 00:15:12,160
and then I'll make
investigative documentaries using my...

273
00:15:12,240 --> 00:15:13,400
Purple penis hands.

274
00:15:14,680 --> 00:15:18,080
<i>The Chronicles of Glenoxi</i>
is an epic alien love comic book series

275
00:15:18,160 --> 00:15:20,200
that will be made into
a global movie franchise

276
00:15:20,280 --> 00:15:21,760
and eventually be screened in space.

277
00:15:25,080 --> 00:15:27,320
Right, last but not least.

278
00:15:27,800 --> 00:15:28,880
Maeve, you're up.

279
00:15:33,840 --> 00:15:38,320
[clears throat] I left my essay at home,
Miss Sands. Sorry.

280
00:15:38,920 --> 00:15:42,120
Maeve, this class is for people
who want to plan for their future

281
00:15:42,200 --> 00:15:43,920
and optimize their opportunities.

282
00:15:44,480 --> 00:15:46,280
Organizational skills are key.

283
00:15:46,680 --> 00:15:47,760
Don't let it happen again.

284
00:15:49,240 --> 00:15:51,720
All right, uh, thanks to Maeve,
you can all...

285
00:15:52,240 --> 00:15:53,600
head off to lunch early.

286
00:15:54,120 --> 00:15:56,080
Oh... eh, um, uh...

287
00:15:56,160 --> 00:16:00,360
On a side note,
since Nigel moved back to Australia,

288
00:16:00,440 --> 00:16:03,280
the Moordale Quiz Heads
are looking for a new member

289
00:16:03,360 --> 00:16:04,960
to join the team and compete

290
00:16:05,040 --> 00:16:08,400
at the National Student Quiz Championships
this year.

291
00:16:08,480 --> 00:16:11,680
So, who's interested in joining
Viv, Dex and Steve

292
00:16:11,760 --> 00:16:13,120
in representing their school?

293
00:16:16,600 --> 00:16:18,040
Oh, right, all of you then?

294
00:16:18,720 --> 00:16:22,640
Okay, well, I'll make my decision
by tomorrow. Off you go.

295
00:16:30,360 --> 00:16:34,040
Man, I just don't get why
Maeve Wiley is in this class.

296
00:16:41,440 --> 00:16:42,920
Are you Vivienne Odesanya?

297
00:16:43,000 --> 00:16:44,200
Yeah, that's me, why?

298
00:16:44,280 --> 00:16:46,240
- Jackson Marchetti.
- I know who you are.

299
00:16:46,960 --> 00:16:48,080
Okay.

300
00:16:48,160 --> 00:16:50,760
So, Headmaster Groff said
you'd tutor me this term?

301
00:16:50,840 --> 00:16:51,680
[exhales]
Did he now?

302
00:16:51,760 --> 00:16:53,680
Apparently, you're the smartest kid
in the school.

303
00:16:53,760 --> 00:16:55,040
That's true, but I'm also busy.

304
00:16:55,120 --> 00:16:56,200
Okay, wait, wait, wait.

305
00:16:56,600 --> 00:16:59,320
Headmaster Groff said he'd give you
extra credit if you'd help me out.

306
00:16:59,400 --> 00:17:01,320
And we don't actually have to do any work.

307
00:17:01,400 --> 00:17:03,920
I've just got to keep Groff happy
until I'm back in the pool.

308
00:17:04,000 --> 00:17:06,319
- Okay. Your first session's tonight.
- Yeah?

309
00:17:07,160 --> 00:17:08,599
Yeah, but it's the fair tonight.

310
00:17:08,680 --> 00:17:11,599
Listen, my schedule's organized
for optimum time management.

311
00:17:11,680 --> 00:17:12,599
Take it or leave it.

312
00:17:13,000 --> 00:17:14,720
Picnic tables, six o'clock.

313
00:17:14,800 --> 00:17:17,079
Bring your maths homework,
and don't be late.

314
00:17:25,119 --> 00:17:27,400
Should have seen this smug look
Ola gave me earlier.

315
00:17:29,040 --> 00:17:29,960
I don't like her.

316
00:17:31,040 --> 00:17:32,560
Why? She seems nice.

317
00:17:32,640 --> 00:17:34,400
She's still hung up on Otis.

318
00:17:34,960 --> 00:17:37,680
It's got nothing to do with Otis.
I'm over him.

319
00:17:40,640 --> 00:17:43,800
- How you getting on with your form?
- [Aimee] Everyone has a thing except me.

320
00:17:43,880 --> 00:17:47,000
I'm hoping this form
is gonna tell me what my thing is.

321
00:17:47,080 --> 00:17:49,040
- Your thing?
- Yes, my thing.

322
00:17:49,800 --> 00:17:51,680
You have your feminine books.

323
00:17:51,760 --> 00:17:54,920
- Feminist.
- Steve has his Quiz Brains thing.

324
00:17:55,000 --> 00:17:56,040
Quiz Heads.

325
00:17:57,600 --> 00:17:58,880
So great being part of the team.

326
00:17:58,960 --> 00:18:00,400
What's so good about it?

327
00:18:00,480 --> 00:18:02,080
Well, facts are fun,

328
00:18:02,160 --> 00:18:06,360
and if we get through to the final,
it's going to be a very big deal.

329
00:18:08,840 --> 00:18:10,160
[Maeve] What's your form say?

330
00:18:11,000 --> 00:18:13,000
It says I should be a baker.

331
00:18:14,160 --> 00:18:17,000
Aims, I think it might be banker.
Baker's not on there.

332
00:18:17,800 --> 00:18:18,760
[mouthing] Banker?

333
00:18:19,440 --> 00:18:20,400
Hmm.

334
00:18:21,000 --> 00:18:23,320
I think I'm going to stick with baker.

335
00:18:24,440 --> 00:18:26,360
I do really like toast.

336
00:18:30,080 --> 00:18:31,160
Wow.

337
00:18:35,400 --> 00:18:37,760
Maeve thinks she's so scary
and revolutionary

338
00:18:37,840 --> 00:18:39,640
just because she used to have pink hair.

339
00:18:39,800 --> 00:18:41,920
Is it because she hangs out
with your boyfriend all the time?

340
00:18:42,000 --> 00:18:42,920
No.

341
00:18:43,640 --> 00:18:45,400
She's just not my kind of person.

342
00:18:48,360 --> 00:18:51,040
Why? Do you think it's weird
that they run the sex clinic together?

343
00:18:51,600 --> 00:18:52,440
Yes.

344
00:18:55,640 --> 00:18:58,240
- So, how's it going with Otis?
- Good.

345
00:18:59,560 --> 00:19:02,040
Yeah, well, kind of.
Yeah, we're taking things slow.

346
00:19:02,120 --> 00:19:03,200
Which is fine.

347
00:19:03,800 --> 00:19:06,560
I sometimes just wish
we'd move along a bit, you know.

348
00:19:07,000 --> 00:19:08,120
Not overthink so much.

349
00:19:08,200 --> 00:19:09,840
Has he touched your vagina?

350
00:19:09,920 --> 00:19:10,800
Not yet.

351
00:19:11,320 --> 00:19:13,800
He sort of hovers
and then loses his nerve.

352
00:19:13,880 --> 00:19:15,920
It's... really frustrating.

353
00:19:16,680 --> 00:19:19,160
- Just tell him what you want.
- I think it'll freak him out.

354
00:19:20,480 --> 00:19:22,440
Human boys are so fragile.

355
00:19:35,640 --> 00:19:37,040
[door opens]

356
00:19:37,120 --> 00:19:40,600
- [man 1, laughing] Such an idiot.
- What are you laughing at?

357
00:19:41,920 --> 00:19:43,000
Nothing.

358
00:19:44,520 --> 00:19:45,800
Then what's so funny?

359
00:19:45,880 --> 00:19:48,520
Luke spilled some water
and it looks like he's pissed himself.

360
00:19:50,520 --> 00:19:51,880
You need to chill out, man.

361
00:19:52,760 --> 00:19:53,680
Look...

362
00:19:56,920 --> 00:19:58,240
grab it with your right...

363
00:19:58,880 --> 00:20:01,080
and let your left slap it.

364
00:20:02,160 --> 00:20:03,840
Took me ages to get it as well.

365
00:20:25,760 --> 00:20:26,760
Is this okay?

366
00:20:26,840 --> 00:20:27,880
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

367
00:20:32,000 --> 00:20:32,920
[exhales nervously]

368
00:20:35,000 --> 00:20:36,080
[Otis] Okay.

369
00:20:39,200 --> 00:20:40,160
[both chuckle]

370
00:20:40,240 --> 00:20:41,200
[Otis] Yep.

371
00:20:48,160 --> 00:20:49,520
Oh!

372
00:20:52,920 --> 00:20:54,160
Oh. Ah.

373
00:20:54,240 --> 00:20:58,720
[Otis, whispering] Twelve o'clock,
three o'clock, six o'clock, nine o'clock.

374
00:20:59,280 --> 00:21:00,720
Did you say something?

375
00:21:01,480 --> 00:21:02,840
No, sorry.

376
00:21:03,440 --> 00:21:04,640
Are you enjoying it?

377
00:21:09,360 --> 00:21:10,400
[Ola gasps]

378
00:21:11,120 --> 00:21:15,040
- Then spread it. Back to 12 o'clock...
- [moans, chuckles]

379
00:21:15,120 --> 00:21:17,080
...three o'clock, nine o'clock.

380
00:21:18,920 --> 00:21:20,880
[Ola moaning]

381
00:21:20,960 --> 00:21:23,040
[laughing]

382
00:21:25,520 --> 00:21:27,400
- Ooh.
- Ooh?

383
00:21:27,480 --> 00:21:28,840
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

384
00:21:28,920 --> 00:21:30,320
- Wow.
- Yeah.

385
00:21:30,400 --> 00:21:31,440
It was good?

386
00:21:31,520 --> 00:21:33,920
It was... so nice.

387
00:21:36,440 --> 00:21:37,480
Okay.

388
00:21:39,560 --> 00:21:41,680
It was really, really bad.

389
00:21:41,760 --> 00:21:45,160
He was moving his fingers
like he was dialing a 1920s telephone,

390
00:21:45,240 --> 00:21:48,080
but really fast, with no rhythm.

391
00:21:48,160 --> 00:21:50,960
And then he was kind of, like,
jabbing at the same time.

392
00:21:51,040 --> 00:21:52,920
And then he kept looking at the clock
on his wall

393
00:21:53,000 --> 00:21:55,040
like he was timing himself or something.

394
00:21:55,560 --> 00:21:57,200
You need to tell him it was bad.

395
00:21:57,280 --> 00:21:58,960
Uh-uh. It'll hurt his feelings.

396
00:21:59,760 --> 00:22:01,560
Maybe it will be better next time?

397
00:22:03,480 --> 00:22:05,240
I-I definitely have to tell him.

398
00:22:05,320 --> 00:22:06,720
- [Eric] Did you do it?
- Uh-huh.

399
00:22:06,800 --> 00:22:08,560
- [laughing]
- I know!

400
00:22:08,640 --> 00:22:11,120
I knew you had
a freshly-fingered glow about you!

401
00:22:11,200 --> 00:22:12,920
- Tell me everything.
- So...

402
00:22:13,000 --> 00:22:16,560
I think I might have facilitated
a crescendo.

403
00:22:17,600 --> 00:22:19,000
- The big O?
- Yeah.

404
00:22:19,080 --> 00:22:20,480
- First time round?
- Yeah.

405
00:22:20,560 --> 00:22:23,720
I stuck to my clock technique,
and I don't know, bingo.

406
00:22:23,800 --> 00:22:25,680
- My God.
- Orgasm town.

407
00:22:25,760 --> 00:22:29,560
I feel like maybe fingering
is my sexual superpower or something.

408
00:22:29,640 --> 00:22:31,160
Oh, dude, I'm so proud of you.

409
00:22:31,240 --> 00:22:32,760
- Thanks, man.
- Let's go celebrate.

410
00:22:32,840 --> 00:22:35,440
- What shall we do first?
- You don't think it was beginner's luck,

411
00:22:35,520 --> 00:22:37,040
- do you?
- No.

412
00:22:37,120 --> 00:22:39,440
No, no, no, no, no,
you're definitely Fingertron.

413
00:22:39,920 --> 00:22:43,560
Oh, my God!
They have Crazy Jungle, come on.

414
00:22:45,800 --> 00:22:47,000
[Otis grunts]

415
00:22:49,120 --> 00:22:50,560
[Eric laughing]

416
00:22:51,800 --> 00:22:54,000
Why am I here? I hate fairs.

417
00:22:54,080 --> 00:22:56,160
You're here because
Steve is doing extra study

418
00:22:56,240 --> 00:22:59,080
for your stupid altitude scheme.
You're my date.

419
00:22:59,160 --> 00:23:01,120
- Aptitude scheme, Aimee.
- Yeah, that's what I said.

420
00:23:01,200 --> 00:23:02,920
- Yeah.
- Can you win me a giant pig?

421
00:23:05,680 --> 00:23:06,600
Hi.

422
00:23:07,720 --> 00:23:08,600
Hey.

423
00:23:23,720 --> 00:23:25,000
[exhales]

424
00:23:26,040 --> 00:23:27,640
[man] And we have a winner.

425
00:23:32,440 --> 00:23:33,520
I need to go find Otis.

426
00:23:37,040 --> 00:23:38,480
That's the kind of competitive spirit

427
00:23:38,560 --> 00:23:40,760
you should be bringing
to aptitude scheme, Maeve.

428
00:23:45,600 --> 00:23:47,000
See you tomorrow in class.

429
00:23:50,640 --> 00:23:51,680
I'll be right back.

430
00:23:54,400 --> 00:23:56,440
Ms. Sands. Ms. Sands.

431
00:23:56,520 --> 00:23:57,480
Um...

432
00:23:57,560 --> 00:24:00,280
I did write the...
the ten-years'-time essay.

433
00:24:01,720 --> 00:24:04,120
I didn't realize we had to read it out,
so I got embarrassed.

434
00:24:05,040 --> 00:24:08,520
"In ten years' time, I want to live
in a house with big windows,"

435
00:24:08,600 --> 00:24:12,120
I want the house to be large enough
to have a kitchen table with four chairs

436
00:24:12,200 --> 00:24:15,200
but not too roomy
to ever feel the depth of my aloneness.

437
00:24:17,040 --> 00:24:18,600
Because I'll probably be alone.

438
00:24:19,840 --> 00:24:23,320
But I think aloneness won't feel
so all-consuming with windows

439
00:24:23,400 --> 00:24:26,360
"that protect me from the world
but still let me watch it."

440
00:24:26,440 --> 00:24:28,160
I'm sorry. Sorry.

441
00:24:31,120 --> 00:24:33,120
I don't think I belong in the class.

442
00:24:37,840 --> 00:24:39,720
You're a beautiful writer, Maeve.

443
00:24:40,560 --> 00:24:44,360
You can have more expansive dreams
than four chairs and some windows.

444
00:24:47,440 --> 00:24:48,520
Think about it.

445
00:24:55,080 --> 00:24:55,920
[sighs]

446
00:24:56,000 --> 00:24:57,720
[indistinct background chatter]

447
00:24:58,600 --> 00:25:01,640
- What? What?
- You're really not good at this.

448
00:25:04,240 --> 00:25:06,200
Have you got a problem with me
or something?

449
00:25:06,280 --> 00:25:08,080
Look, uh, it's simple.

450
00:25:08,160 --> 00:25:10,440
So this is hidden quadratics.

451
00:25:10,520 --> 00:25:13,360
You need to substitute the Y...

452
00:25:13,440 --> 00:25:16,160
- Mm-hmm.
- ...and then back substitute...

453
00:25:17,000 --> 00:25:18,120
the X.

454
00:25:19,000 --> 00:25:21,720
Oh. See, no one's ever explained it
to me like this before.

455
00:25:23,000 --> 00:25:24,760
You dating Pythagoras, Jackson?

456
00:25:24,840 --> 00:25:26,600
Nah, mate, we're just studying.

457
00:25:28,680 --> 00:25:29,880
They were just being idiots.

458
00:25:30,440 --> 00:25:31,640
It's fine.

459
00:25:31,720 --> 00:25:34,120
Men who engage in sporting activities
at school

460
00:25:34,640 --> 00:25:38,160
are statistically more likely
to work in menial jobs as adults.

461
00:25:38,920 --> 00:25:40,120
Well, that's a bit harsh.

462
00:25:40,200 --> 00:25:42,160
No, it's realistic.

463
00:25:42,840 --> 00:25:44,880
Look, if your hand doesn't heal,

464
00:25:45,760 --> 00:25:47,160
what is your backup plan?

465
00:25:48,080 --> 00:25:49,760
And even if it does heal,

466
00:25:49,840 --> 00:25:53,000
professional athletes
statistically peak at 21.

467
00:25:53,840 --> 00:25:57,720
So it might be worth
acquiring some other skills.

468
00:25:59,480 --> 00:26:01,840
Statistics are a real buzzkill,
you know that?

469
00:26:08,000 --> 00:26:10,720
[Morris] Parade, shun!

470
00:26:12,280 --> 00:26:14,320
Slope arms!

471
00:26:16,720 --> 00:26:18,160
General salute!

472
00:26:18,960 --> 00:26:21,800
Present arms!

473
00:26:24,920 --> 00:26:27,280
Slope arms!

474
00:26:39,000 --> 00:26:39,880
That...

475
00:26:40,720 --> 00:26:42,920
is a real improvement, Groff.

476
00:26:48,440 --> 00:26:49,880
To your duties.

477
00:26:50,360 --> 00:26:52,440
Fall out!

478
00:26:55,120 --> 00:26:56,960
- Well done, mate.
- [Luke] Good job, man.

479
00:27:03,360 --> 00:27:05,920
- We're going on the Ferris wheel.
- Wind isn't good for my hair.

480
00:27:06,000 --> 00:27:08,400
I don't think I was clear.
Rahim's going on the Ferris wheel,

481
00:27:08,480 --> 00:27:10,000
so we're going on the Ferris wheel.

482
00:27:12,520 --> 00:27:15,520
You can squeeze in with me and Anwar
for the next ride, Rahim.

483
00:27:15,600 --> 00:27:16,960
No, thank you.

484
00:27:17,040 --> 00:27:19,040
What do you mean why are we going on it?
It's fun.

485
00:27:19,120 --> 00:27:21,200
It's the least safe
of any of the rides here.

486
00:27:21,280 --> 00:27:22,840
- It's fun.
- How do you know it's fun?

487
00:27:22,920 --> 00:27:25,320
Because I'm telling you that it's fun,
that's how I know.

488
00:27:25,400 --> 00:27:27,040
[Otis] Oh, I am going to die.

489
00:27:27,120 --> 00:27:29,400
- [Eric] Come on then.
- I'm coming, I'm coming.

490
00:27:29,480 --> 00:27:30,840
- [ride rattling]
- [Otis] Ooh!

491
00:27:30,920 --> 00:27:33,160
- What was that? That was really unsafe.
- Calm down.

492
00:27:33,240 --> 00:27:38,160
- Eric. Ahh, I'm sorry. I feel vulnerable.
- Excuse me, Oatcake! Get back here!

493
00:27:38,240 --> 00:27:39,640
[Otis] It'll be fine, you're fine.

494
00:27:43,560 --> 00:27:45,440
- Hello.
- Hi. Hello.

495
00:27:45,520 --> 00:27:47,000
[Ferris wheel music playing]

496
00:27:54,040 --> 00:27:57,200
- Why won't he notice me?
- Do you think they do vegan hotdogs?

497
00:27:57,600 --> 00:27:58,760
[Ruby exhales sharply]

498
00:28:01,240 --> 00:28:03,000
Milburn, can I have a word, please?

499
00:28:03,080 --> 00:28:04,000
Um...

500
00:28:04,080 --> 00:28:06,480
It's about your... biology test.

501
00:28:07,360 --> 00:28:09,760
What... What biology test, sir?

502
00:28:10,600 --> 00:28:13,440
It's not really about a test.
There is no test. Listen...

503
00:28:13,520 --> 00:28:18,560
I heard on the grapevine
that you deal with matters of the heart.

504
00:28:19,360 --> 00:28:21,720
And I'm desperate for some advice.

505
00:28:22,120 --> 00:28:24,160
Thing is, I have a friend
who speaks Spanish

506
00:28:24,240 --> 00:28:26,440
and I can't understand her at all.

507
00:28:26,520 --> 00:28:27,880
She says things like, <i>"Hola...</i>

508
00:28:27,960 --> 00:28:30,440
[speaking broken Spanish]

509
00:28:30,520 --> 00:28:33,160
...and... all I can hear is...

510
00:28:33,880 --> 00:28:35,320
Shakira, Shakira.

511
00:28:36,200 --> 00:28:37,560
I don't speak Spanish, sir.

512
00:28:37,640 --> 00:28:39,320
I can't do dirty talk.

513
00:28:41,640 --> 00:28:42,960
I find it mortifying.

514
00:28:44,000 --> 00:28:45,000
Oh...

515
00:28:46,200 --> 00:28:47,400
Well, uh...

516
00:28:48,720 --> 00:28:52,080
sometimes when we learn new skills,
we can feel exposed.

517
00:28:52,560 --> 00:28:54,440
Right? And you wouldn't go
to a foreign country

518
00:28:54,520 --> 00:28:57,880
without some basic understanding
of the language.

519
00:28:57,960 --> 00:29:01,280
So why don't you write a script
for yourself

520
00:29:01,360 --> 00:29:04,280
and practice speaking the words
until they feel more comfortable?

521
00:29:05,520 --> 00:29:08,960
It's about making an effort
to take little steps to meet her halfway.

522
00:29:09,920 --> 00:29:10,960
Does that makes sense?

523
00:29:12,200 --> 00:29:13,120
Yes.

524
00:29:14,600 --> 00:29:16,560
<i>Muchas gracias, maestro.</i>
[chuckles]

525
00:29:17,560 --> 00:29:19,800
- What shall we say, a pony?
- Ah... Uh...

526
00:29:19,880 --> 00:29:21,920
- Or a monkey?
- Please don't pay me.

527
00:29:22,840 --> 00:29:24,360
Let's not speak of this again.

528
00:29:26,760 --> 00:29:27,760
You bet.

529
00:29:38,840 --> 00:29:41,000
[ride hinges squeaking]

530
00:29:43,760 --> 00:29:46,160
- So, what are the interesting landmarks...
- Um...

531
00:29:46,240 --> 00:29:47,280
...around here?

532
00:29:47,360 --> 00:29:50,320
There's nothing interesting
to see round here.

533
00:29:50,400 --> 00:29:51,440
[laughs]

534
00:29:51,520 --> 00:29:52,640
Very boring.

535
00:29:53,440 --> 00:29:54,280
Sorry.

536
00:29:55,920 --> 00:29:57,560
Only boring people get bored.

537
00:30:03,760 --> 00:30:05,960
"As if you were on fire from within.

538
00:30:06,040 --> 00:30:08,400
The moon lives
in the lining of your skin."

539
00:30:12,200 --> 00:30:13,160
Uh, pardon?

540
00:30:13,920 --> 00:30:16,560
- It's about finding beauty in the world.
- Oh.

541
00:30:16,640 --> 00:30:18,760
- It's a poem by Pablo Neruda.
- Oh.

542
00:30:21,640 --> 00:30:22,760
I don't know her.

543
00:30:26,640 --> 00:30:28,640
[ride motor whirring]

544
00:30:40,600 --> 00:30:42,640
- Goodbye.
- Uh, bye.

545
00:30:50,520 --> 00:30:52,680
[Ola] I think you're jabbing the duck
too hard, Otis.

546
00:30:52,760 --> 00:30:55,960
Maybe you should just try it
a bit softer...

547
00:30:56,600 --> 00:30:58,320
a bit slower maybe.

548
00:30:58,960 --> 00:31:00,680
Yes! See, I got... See.

549
00:31:01,840 --> 00:31:03,160
Thank you. Thank you, sir.

550
00:31:04,600 --> 00:31:05,680
Ta-da!

551
00:31:05,760 --> 00:31:06,720
For you.

552
00:31:07,280 --> 00:31:08,680
- There you go.
- [mouthing] Tell him.

553
00:31:08,760 --> 00:31:10,880
Okay. Um, thank you.

554
00:31:12,040 --> 00:31:13,520
I need to tell you something.

555
00:31:13,600 --> 00:31:14,600
- Um...
- Sure.

556
00:31:15,360 --> 00:31:16,680
Okay. Uh, I...

557
00:31:19,640 --> 00:31:22,800
Uh, I really, really don't like...

558
00:31:26,080 --> 00:31:26,920
goldfish.

559
00:31:27,800 --> 00:31:28,640
Here you go.

560
00:31:28,720 --> 00:31:30,400
- [chuckles]
- Yeah.

561
00:31:30,480 --> 00:31:32,360
Okay, thanks.

562
00:31:32,440 --> 00:31:33,480
Yeah.

563
00:31:34,400 --> 00:31:36,600
Hey, do you wanna hang at mine?

564
00:31:36,680 --> 00:31:38,960
- We could, you know...
- No.

565
00:31:39,800 --> 00:31:41,760
I've got loads of homework
that I need to do.

566
00:31:41,840 --> 00:31:44,320
- In fact, I need to go... now.
- Okay.

567
00:31:44,400 --> 00:31:49,320
- But thank you so much for the bear. Dog.
- Thank you for the fish.

568
00:31:49,400 --> 00:31:51,440
Okay, I'll see you. [clears throat]

569
00:31:53,680 --> 00:31:54,760
[gasps]

570
00:31:54,840 --> 00:31:57,520
My friend's boyfriend doesn't know
how to finger her properly.

571
00:31:58,520 --> 00:32:00,280
I'm off duty, sorry.

572
00:32:00,360 --> 00:32:01,720
He's really bad at it.

573
00:32:01,800 --> 00:32:03,440
Tell your friend's boyfriend

574
00:32:03,520 --> 00:32:05,600
to look up something called
the clock technique.

575
00:32:05,680 --> 00:32:08,000
It looks a bit complicated at first,
granted,

576
00:32:08,080 --> 00:32:11,240
but once you get it right,
the results are astounding.

577
00:32:11,880 --> 00:32:12,720
It's you.

578
00:32:13,120 --> 00:32:14,600
You're my friend's boyfriend.

579
00:32:14,920 --> 00:32:16,320
You're bad at fingering.

580
00:32:16,400 --> 00:32:18,640
Please don't tell Ola
I said anything, but...

581
00:32:19,040 --> 00:32:19,920
sort it out?

582
00:32:28,480 --> 00:32:30,840
[doorbell buzzing]

583
00:32:34,960 --> 00:32:36,400
I'm ready to talk dirty.

584
00:32:45,800 --> 00:32:46,960
[Colin gasps]

585
00:32:47,040 --> 00:32:49,160
I'm gonna do nasty things to you.

586
00:32:49,240 --> 00:32:50,480
- [Emily groans]
- Yeah.

587
00:32:51,520 --> 00:32:53,040
I'm gonna get you so wet.

588
00:32:53,520 --> 00:32:55,560
You're going to feel like
your water just broke.

589
00:32:57,360 --> 00:32:59,240
- What?
- I'm gonna treat you so badly,

590
00:32:59,320 --> 00:33:01,840
you'll be late for work tomorrow
and I'm gonna get you fired,

591
00:33:01,920 --> 00:33:03,440
completely ruin your life.

592
00:33:03,520 --> 00:33:04,520
[chuckles]

593
00:33:05,360 --> 00:33:07,160
Wait that's not... Is that right?

594
00:33:07,240 --> 00:33:08,280
Um...

595
00:33:09,360 --> 00:33:10,360
[gasps]

596
00:33:11,280 --> 00:33:12,240
[sighs]

597
00:33:12,680 --> 00:33:14,920
Uh... this isn't working.

598
00:33:17,480 --> 00:33:18,480
Isn't it?

599
00:33:27,240 --> 00:33:28,360
[sighs]

600
00:33:31,480 --> 00:33:33,640
[whispering]
Grab your stuff. Come with us.

601
00:33:36,000 --> 00:33:37,080
[door opens]

602
00:33:49,720 --> 00:33:51,440
[sniffs]

603
00:33:57,000 --> 00:33:58,840
[Luke] Here you go. That'll keep you warm.

604
00:33:59,440 --> 00:34:00,720
[Eli] Are you homesick yet?

605
00:34:01,400 --> 00:34:03,440
I was proper homesick
when I first got here.

606
00:34:04,000 --> 00:34:04,840
Yeah.

607
00:34:05,520 --> 00:34:08,040
- He used to cry every night for his mummy.
- Did not.

608
00:34:08,120 --> 00:34:08,960
[laughs]

609
00:34:10,120 --> 00:34:11,719
I miss my mum a bit, but...

610
00:34:13,239 --> 00:34:14,600
not my dad though. He's...

611
00:34:14,679 --> 00:34:15,800
An arsehole?

612
00:34:16,719 --> 00:34:18,719
Yep, my dad's a dick too.

613
00:34:18,800 --> 00:34:20,320
My dad's a pussy.

614
00:34:21,120 --> 00:34:22,360
A mean one.

615
00:34:23,840 --> 00:34:25,440
[loudly]
Fuck all the mean dads.

616
00:34:26,400 --> 00:34:28,679
Fuck 'em! [laughs]

617
00:34:31,199 --> 00:34:32,719
Fuck all the dads.

618
00:34:35,440 --> 00:34:37,040
- You got a girlfriend?
- Yep.

619
00:34:40,040 --> 00:34:41,000
Her name's Aimee.

620
00:34:42,120 --> 00:34:43,360
Big tits.

621
00:34:45,320 --> 00:34:47,000
You a boob or an arse man?

622
00:34:47,800 --> 00:34:49,679
I like elbows.

623
00:34:50,840 --> 00:34:52,199
[laughing]

624
00:35:09,200 --> 00:35:11,000
- I love you.
- [Sofia] Oh, hold on, darling.

625
00:35:12,840 --> 00:35:14,000
I'm not training, Mum.

626
00:35:14,080 --> 00:35:15,680
Got to keep on track.

627
00:35:15,760 --> 00:35:17,440
You'll be swimming again
before you know it.

628
00:35:19,040 --> 00:35:20,360
Well, what if I'm not?

629
00:35:21,480 --> 00:35:24,480
You know, maybe I should get,
like, a new hobby or something.

630
00:35:24,960 --> 00:35:26,520
But your hand is going to heal.

631
00:35:27,720 --> 00:35:28,640
- Yeah.
- Yes?

632
00:35:28,720 --> 00:35:29,760
- Yeah.
- Okay.

633
00:35:30,280 --> 00:35:31,240
Go on.

634
00:35:31,840 --> 00:35:33,880
- Have a good day.
- Yeah, you too.

635
00:35:35,080 --> 00:35:37,080
[indistinct chatter]

636
00:35:38,640 --> 00:35:40,600
- Well, what do I do?
- [stammers]

637
00:35:40,680 --> 00:35:43,280
You're kind of asking the wrong guy
about fingering, dude.

638
00:35:43,880 --> 00:35:46,360
I don't know. Shit.

639
00:35:48,320 --> 00:35:49,520
For you to read.

640
00:35:50,680 --> 00:35:51,640
Thanks.

641
00:35:54,520 --> 00:35:55,640
Thank you.

642
00:35:58,960 --> 00:36:00,560
First, he looks at me
like he wants to kill me,

643
00:36:00,640 --> 00:36:02,680
then he calls me boring,
and now he's giving me books.

644
00:36:02,760 --> 00:36:05,480
- Maybe he wants to be your friend.
- Or maybe he's a teenage Ted Bundy.

645
00:36:05,560 --> 00:36:06,840
This is serious, okay?

646
00:36:06,920 --> 00:36:10,440
I need to find someone
who understands vaginas.

647
00:36:10,520 --> 00:36:11,400
Your mum.

648
00:36:12,160 --> 00:36:14,960
- I'm being serious.
- No, Otis, your mum is here.

649
00:36:20,240 --> 00:36:21,480
Okay. All right.

650
00:36:24,080 --> 00:36:25,920
Good luck, Fingertron.

651
00:36:26,400 --> 00:36:27,480
[laughing]

652
00:36:37,480 --> 00:36:38,560
[mutters to himself]

653
00:36:39,920 --> 00:36:42,000
I'm branching out. You should audition.

654
00:36:42,760 --> 00:36:45,240
[chuckles] That's not really my thing.

655
00:36:45,640 --> 00:36:46,480
Thanks, though.

656
00:36:47,720 --> 00:36:49,280
But you're acting all the time.

657
00:36:51,920 --> 00:36:53,720
And you'll probably get a sword.

658
00:37:04,520 --> 00:37:05,480
No hats.

659
00:37:05,960 --> 00:37:07,280
Take it to your dorm.

660
00:37:08,840 --> 00:37:09,760
Come on.

661
00:37:11,520 --> 00:37:13,200
[Eli and Luke moaning]

662
00:37:15,760 --> 00:37:17,840
I've still got your, uh, hat.

663
00:37:17,920 --> 00:37:19,760
[moaning continues]

664
00:37:19,840 --> 00:37:22,760
- We're not poofs or anything.
- Yeah, I was thinking about my girlfriend.

665
00:37:22,840 --> 00:37:26,360
And I was thinking of your girlfriend,
you know... with the big tits.

666
00:37:29,240 --> 00:37:30,320
I won't tell anyone.

667
00:37:56,280 --> 00:37:57,680
I need your advice.

668
00:37:59,320 --> 00:38:00,160
I'm pretty...

669
00:38:00,720 --> 00:38:04,680
I'm bad at fingering. Really bad.
And my girlfriend is actively avoiding me.

670
00:38:05,080 --> 00:38:06,040
Please help.

671
00:38:07,360 --> 00:38:08,240
Okay.

672
00:38:10,320 --> 00:38:11,800
But only because I pity you.

673
00:38:17,160 --> 00:38:19,520
- Show me what you did then.
- I was about to eat that.

674
00:38:25,400 --> 00:38:27,040
- You want me to...
- Mm-hmm.

675
00:38:29,120 --> 00:38:30,240
Okay. Um...

676
00:38:32,280 --> 00:38:33,360
Sorry.

677
00:38:33,440 --> 00:38:34,480
Well, I...

678
00:38:35,440 --> 00:38:36,560
I started at...

679
00:38:37,440 --> 00:38:38,560
I started at 12 o'clock...

680
00:38:39,200 --> 00:38:40,760
and went to three o'clock,

681
00:38:40,840 --> 00:38:42,320
and then back down to six.

682
00:38:42,400 --> 00:38:44,320
Oh, it's juicy. And then there was nine.

683
00:38:44,400 --> 00:38:46,200
Congratulations, you can tell the time.

684
00:38:46,920 --> 00:38:47,840
[stammers]

685
00:38:47,920 --> 00:38:52,080
Then I carried on, clockwise,
then I flipped it anti-clockwise.

686
00:38:52,160 --> 00:38:53,720
So you DJ-ed on her vag.

687
00:38:53,800 --> 00:38:55,240
What's with the clock thing?

688
00:38:55,720 --> 00:38:57,280
- It's a technique.
- It's weird.

689
00:38:59,480 --> 00:39:00,400
Continue.

690
00:39:01,600 --> 00:39:03,600
Well, I sort of continued that motion...

691
00:39:03,680 --> 00:39:05,160
Oh, then I had a spread,

692
00:39:05,240 --> 00:39:07,560
which was kind of like that. That's...

693
00:39:07,640 --> 00:39:11,400
- And continued to apply pressure, and...
- Stop jabbing.

694
00:39:11,480 --> 00:39:14,760
- It's not, I'm not really jabbing.
- I think I'd know, it's my orange.

695
00:39:14,840 --> 00:39:16,520
- Actually, it's my orange.
- Shh.

696
00:39:16,600 --> 00:39:17,560
Okay, um...

697
00:39:17,640 --> 00:39:20,920
- This is ridiculous. I'm sorry.
- Look...

698
00:39:23,600 --> 00:39:26,280
there's no magic technique that works
with all women.

699
00:39:27,440 --> 00:39:29,280
Every orange is different,

725
00:40:47,320 --> 00:40:51,200
Well, you can't get pregnant

What type of lubricant would you recommend
for doing anal sex?

731
00:41:10,400 --> 00:41:12,640
[Jean] Well, you should always use
a water-based lubricant.

732
00:41:12,720 --> 00:41:17,280
Oil-based products will decompose
the latex in the condom.
