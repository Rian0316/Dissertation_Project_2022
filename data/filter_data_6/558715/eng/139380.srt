1
00:00:00,100 --> 00:00:01,600
Previously on "desperate housewives"...

2
00:00:01,600 --> 00:00:04,200
I am just trying to move on with my life.

3
00:00:04,300 --> 00:00:06,200
Are you having an affair with my husband?

4
00:00:06,200 --> 00:00:08,100
Suspicion ended in tragedy.

5
00:00:08,100 --> 00:00:11,100
I'm here to see Rex Van De Kamp.
Apparently, he had a heart attack.

6
00:00:11,100 --> 00:00:11,900
Trust...

7
00:00:11,900 --> 00:00:13,400
It kills me that I'm putting you through this.

8
00:00:13,400 --> 00:00:14,500
was put on trial.

9
00:00:14,500 --> 00:00:17,200
Bring me the passport, and Mr. Solis can visit his mother.

10
00:00:17,200 --> 00:00:18,200
And ex-husband

11
00:00:18,200 --> 00:00:20,000
You walked out on your family.

12
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:21,203
was replaced.

13
00:00:21,203 --> 00:00:24,800
She is out there throwing herself at Mike Delfino

14
00:00:24,800 --> 00:00:26,100
And everyone

15
00:00:26,100 --> 00:00:28,700
Wow, your own personal nanny? Smell you.

16
00:00:28,700 --> 00:00:32,300
was getting in over their heads.

17
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:42,200
Edie Britt could never understand
why she didn't have any female friends.

18
00:00:43,100 --> 00:00:47,200
Of course, she always tried to tell
people she didn't need any,

19
00:00:47,800 --> 00:00:49,600
but the truth was

20
00:00:49,600 --> 00:00:53,800
it bothered Edie that other women didn't seem to like her.

21
00:00:55,000 --> 00:00:57,000
Even after moving to Wisteria Lane...

22
00:00:57,000 --> 00:00:59,100
oh, and be careful. There are breakables in there.

23
00:00:59,100 --> 00:01:03,600
Edie couldn't understand why
her neighbors kept their distance.

24
00:01:06,500 --> 00:01:09,700
And then she met Martha Huber.

25
00:01:09,700 --> 00:01:10,500
Hola.

26
00:01:10,500 --> 00:01:15,100
Within five minutes, Mrs. Huber managed to
disparage what Edie was wearing.

27
00:01:15,100 --> 00:01:16,000
No

28
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:21,500
In fact, whenever they got together,
Mrs. Huber insulted her.

29
00:01:21,500 --> 00:01:25,100
She made fun of everything from Edie's makeup...

30
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:28,500
to her taste in men.

31
00:01:28,500 --> 00:01:34,400
Yes, Martha Huber could be cruel,
offensive, and downright mean,

32
00:01:34,600 --> 00:01:42,200
but Edie didn't care, because she was
the first real friend Edie Britt had ever had.

33
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:47,300
But now Martha Huber was missing.
She had vanished without a trace,

34
00:01:47,300 --> 00:01:52,600
and Edie was not embarrassed to admit
she needed her back.

35
00:01:53,300 --> 00:01:54,900
Edie?

36
00:01:54,900 --> 00:01:56,000
Yes.

37
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:57,900
I'm Felicia Tilman,

38
00:01:58,300 --> 00:01:59,500
Martha's sister.

39
00:01:59,500 --> 00:02:01,100
Really?

40
00:02:01,500 --> 00:02:02,800
What's wrong?

41
00:02:03,200 --> 00:02:07,200
Oh, nothing's wrong. It's just that Martha
always said how alike you two were.

42
00:02:07,400 --> 00:02:09,700
I just don't seethe family resemblance.

43
00:02:09,700 --> 00:02:13,000
It's there. It just takes a while to become apparent.

44
00:02:15,600 --> 00:02:17,300
Do you have the key to her house?

45
00:02:17,300 --> 00:02:22,400
I do. After the police kicked the door in,
they put on this temporary lock.

46
00:02:22,400 --> 00:02:25,700
Oh, and by the way, the neighbors
are coming over at noon.

47
00:02:25,700 --> 00:02:28,400
We're going to organize and hand out flyers.

48
00:02:29,600 --> 00:02:30,900
the key?

49
00:02:30,900 --> 00:02:32,400
Oh, right.

50
00:02:32,800 --> 00:02:36,000
You know, I can only imagine how worried you must be.

51
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:37,900
I'm not worried, Edie.

52
00:02:37,900 --> 00:02:42,100
Martha and I have a very intense bond.
We were connected at the most primal level,

53
00:02:42,100 --> 00:02:46,900
and a few days ago, I felt this sensation in my soul.

54
00:02:46,900 --> 00:02:50,000
That's when it first dawned on me that something
had happened to my sister,

55
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:53,200
and then when she didn't arrive
at my home as scheduled,

56
00:02:53,200 --> 00:02:56,400
well, that's when I knew she was dead.

57
00:02:56,400 --> 00:02:59,400
Oh, honey, no. You mustn't think like that.

58
00:02:59,400 --> 00:03:00,900
Martha's only missing.

59
00:03:00,900 --> 00:03:04,800
No, Edie. She's dead.

60
00:03:04,800 --> 00:03:10,700
But she's my sister, and I'm going to find out
exactly what happened to her.

61
00:03:11,600 --> 00:03:16,300
Look, Felicia, it's natural to freak out
when a loved one's missing.

62
00:03:16,700 --> 00:03:18,300
Loved one?

63
00:03:18,300 --> 00:03:22,200
Oh. Edie, let me be clear about this --

64
00:03:22,600 --> 00:03:25,200
I hated Martha.

65
00:03:25,600 --> 00:03:30,700
She was a wretched pig of a woman, and the day
she died, this world became a better place.

66
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:36,800
It was in that moment that Edie finally
saw the family resemblance.

67
00:04:15,800 --> 00:04:20,000
Episode 11: Move On

68
00:04:21,600 --> 00:04:24,000
Mrs. Huber was missing.

69
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:30,600
The words echoed down Wisteria Lane until every last
resident was aware of her disappearance.

70
00:04:30,600 --> 00:04:33,700
By noon, dozens of neighbors had gathered.

71
00:04:33,700 --> 00:04:35,800
Some came to volunteer.

72
00:04:35,800 --> 00:04:37,800
Some came in sympathy.

73
00:04:37,800 --> 00:04:42,400
And some came to learn exactly what the police knew

74
00:04:42,500 --> 00:04:44,900
and what they didn't.

75
00:04:45,400 --> 00:04:47,600
So I'll need you to pass out flyers.

76
00:04:47,600 --> 00:04:51,700
Put them in the mall, the park, anywhere you think
Mrs. Huber might have been seen.

77
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:55,200
We need to jump on this. Time is of the essence.

78
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:57,800
Edie, would you like to say something?

79
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:03,100
On behalf of Martha and her sister Felicia,

80
00:05:04,200 --> 00:05:07,000
I'd like to thank you all for coming here today.

81
00:05:07,400 --> 00:05:11,600
You know, my last conversation
with Martha was one of anger,

82
00:05:12,400 --> 00:05:15,400
and I'll never forgive myself for the things that I said.

83
00:05:16,100 --> 00:05:19,200
I lay awake at night thinking about it.

84
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:29,400
I don't know how she did it, but Edie
managed to make this all about her.

85
00:05:29,400 --> 00:05:31,700
She's a talented girl, our Edie.

86
00:05:31,700 --> 00:05:34,200
Has anybody talked to Bree? How's Rex doing?

87
00:05:34,200 --> 00:05:36,100
She's bringing him home from the hospital today.

88
00:05:36,100 --> 00:05:39,300
Boy, I don't know how he had a heart attack.
He was so young.

89
00:05:39,400 --> 00:05:41,600
Hey, how creepy is Mrs. Huber's sister?

90
00:05:41,600 --> 00:05:42,800
I know.

91
00:05:42,800 --> 00:05:45,700
The way she was talking about Mrs. Huber,
it was like she was already dead.

92
00:05:45,700 --> 00:05:46,900
You don't think she's...

93
00:05:46,900 --> 00:05:49,900
oh, no. I'm sure she's fine.
We're talking about Mrs. Huber.

94
00:05:49,900 --> 00:05:52,000
She's like a roach.

95
00:05:52,200 --> 00:05:57,500
I just wanted you to know that everyone on Wisteria Lane
is praying for your sister's safe return.

96
00:05:58,600 --> 00:06:01,400
Oh, I seriously doubt that.

97
00:06:08,100 --> 00:06:10,300
What do you mean, you're not taking care of him?

98
00:06:10,300 --> 00:06:13,200
Dad's being released today.
He's got to have a place to recuperate.

99
00:06:13,200 --> 00:06:17,000
Well, then, he can go to a motel,
because he is not allowed back in my house.

100
00:06:17,200 --> 00:06:19,300
I thought you two were getting along. What happened?

101
00:06:19,300 --> 00:06:20,900
T hat's...

102
00:06:21,400 --> 00:06:23,100
between your father and me.

103
00:06:23,100 --> 00:06:24,600
You're so selfish.

104
00:06:24,600 --> 00:06:27,500
You know, I am so looking forward to the day that
I get to put you in a nursing home.

105
00:06:27,500 --> 00:06:29,300
I'm sorry to disappoint you, Andrew,

106
00:06:29,301 --> 00:06:32,000
but my plan is to have an embolism and to die young.

107
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:34,700
Yeah, well, we're all rooting for you,
but you might not be so lucky.

108
00:06:34,700 --> 00:06:35,600
Andrew.

109
00:06:35,600 --> 00:06:37,400
You want to see how long I can hold a grudge?

110
00:06:37,400 --> 00:06:40,000
Go ahead and abandon my father,
because I promise you, you'll be sorry.

111
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:42,200
You wouldn't be saying that if you knew what --

112
00:06:42,600 --> 00:06:43,700
knew what?

113
00:06:43,700 --> 00:06:48,100
Well, come on, tell me, because I'd love to
know what my father did that was so awful.

114
00:06:50,200 --> 00:06:53,200
Fine. I will see him through this, but after that,

115
00:06:53,200 --> 00:06:56,500
your father can rot in hell for all I care.

116
00:06:59,300 --> 00:07:02,200
We're not like other families, are we?

117
00:07:02,700 --> 00:07:05,700
No. We're not.

118
00:07:06,300 --> 00:07:09,200
Gabrielle, it's not my fault that
your bank accounts are frozen.

119
00:07:09,200 --> 00:07:11,500
I'm not saying it's your fault. I'm just saying fix it.

120
00:07:11,500 --> 00:07:15,300
Well, I wish I could, but the folks at the justice
department aren't very sympathetic.

121
00:07:15,300 --> 00:07:16,600
I'm running out of money.

122
00:07:16,600 --> 00:07:19,000
In a couple of weeks, I'm going to be screwed.

123
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:20,800
Why don't you hock some of your jewelry?

124
00:07:20,800 --> 00:07:24,800
There's a lot of stuff you never wear,
and most of it's ugly.

125
00:07:25,300 --> 00:07:27,700
Don't you have a toilet to scrub?

126
00:07:28,200 --> 00:07:31,000
I'm just so angry with Carlos.

127
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:34,500
What was he thinking, exporting goods
made from slave labor?

128
00:07:34,500 --> 00:07:36,700
Why couldn't he have embezzled like
other white-collar criminals?

129
00:07:36,700 --> 00:07:39,900
All the justice department wants is to make sure
that Carlos doesn't skip the country.

130
00:07:39,900 --> 00:07:41,800
Now, if he's released on bail,

131
00:07:41,800 --> 00:07:47,200
I can argue that he needs money to live on, and they'll
probably unfreeze one of the smaller accounts.

132
00:07:47,200 --> 00:07:49,800
But they won't release him on bail
until they get the passport.

133
00:07:49,800 --> 00:07:51,500
Exactly.

134
00:07:51,600 --> 00:07:53,800
You haven't found that yet, have you?

135
00:07:54,300 --> 00:07:58,400
Gabrielle wanted her old lifestyle back, no question.

136
00:07:58,400 --> 00:08:03,500
But she wanted Carlos to suffer
for his betrayal even more.

137
00:08:05,100 --> 00:08:06,700
I'm still searching.

138
00:08:06,700 --> 00:08:10,400
Well, in that case, you might want to
think about looking for a job.

139
00:08:14,400 --> 00:08:15,700
So I had a really good time.

140
00:08:15,700 --> 00:08:17,400
Yeah, I bet you did.

141
00:08:21,800 --> 00:08:23,300
Gotcha.

142
00:08:24,100 --> 00:08:25,500
Hey. Is this a bad time?

143
00:08:25,500 --> 00:08:27,000
For you? Of course it is.

144
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:29,303
That's cute. Tax stuff. I need your signature.

145
00:08:29,303 --> 00:08:30,800
We've been divorced over a year.

146
00:08:30,800 --> 00:08:32,500
2003.

147
00:08:32,500 --> 00:08:35,800
Well, please, just come on in.

148
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:40,000
Uh, Mike, I don't think you've officially
met my ex Karl Mayer.

149
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:41,400
Oh, hey. Mike Delfino.

150
00:08:41,400 --> 00:08:43,800
Right. The plumber.

151
00:08:44,300 --> 00:08:50,300
Yeah, I don't have the right washer for this faucet, so I'm
just going to go across the street and get it.

152
00:08:53,100 --> 00:08:54,600
So he seems okay.

153
00:08:54,600 --> 00:08:56,800
Yeah, he is.

154
00:08:57,600 --> 00:08:59,200
So what do you want me to sign?

155
00:08:59,200 --> 00:09:01,900
Oh. I see.

156
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:04,500
By the way, Julie told me about her birthday plans.

157
00:09:04,500 --> 00:09:07,100
Yeah, we're going to a restaurant downtown.

158
00:09:07,100 --> 00:09:09,700
A guy who plays piano and a open Mike.

159
00:09:09,700 --> 00:09:12,600
Julie got a bunch of her girlfriends together,
and so we're just going to make a night of it.

160
00:09:12,600 --> 00:09:14,800
Julie loves to sing. It sounds nice.

161
00:09:14,800 --> 00:09:15,800
Here you go.

162
00:09:15,800 --> 00:09:16,600
All righty.

163
00:09:16,600 --> 00:09:18,600
Give my best to Brandi.

164
00:09:18,700 --> 00:09:20,700
Actually, uh...

165
00:09:20,800 --> 00:09:22,700
we're not together anymore.

166
00:09:22,700 --> 00:09:23,700
You're not?

167
00:09:23,700 --> 00:09:24,500
What happened?

168
00:09:24,500 --> 00:09:27,600
I caught her in bed with another guy.

169
00:09:28,800 --> 00:09:31,500
Go ahead. Do your happy dance. You deserve it.

170
00:09:31,500 --> 00:09:35,400
No, no, really. I'm -- I'm sorry that
you had to go through that. I am.

171
00:09:40,600 --> 00:09:42,000
Uh...

172
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:45,000
it's just really hard for me right now.

173
00:09:45,300 --> 00:09:47,200
Thanks.

174
00:09:54,900 --> 00:09:59,400
try ripping up old photos. It helps.

175
00:10:01,900 --> 00:10:04,000
Well, have fun this weekend.

176
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:05,900
Let me knowhow the party goes.

177
00:10:06,700 --> 00:10:08,500
Karl...

178
00:10:08,500 --> 00:10:11,400
do you want to join us?

179
00:10:15,700 --> 00:10:17,900
Susan...

180
00:10:19,100 --> 00:10:21,000
you're the best.

181
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:25,700
Ooh, well... yeah, I am the best, aren't I?

182
00:10:32,600 --> 00:10:35,000
You know, if we're going to buy a water heater,
we should talk about it.

183
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:37,200
We could go to the mall tomorrow. They're having a sale.

184
00:10:37,200 --> 00:10:39,100
Can we talk about this tomorrow?

185
00:10:39,100 --> 00:10:41,100
Well, I'm just trying to plan my day.

186
00:10:41,100 --> 00:10:43,800
Please, honey, I'm so tired.

187
00:10:45,400 --> 00:10:46,900
Okay.

188
00:10:57,200 --> 00:10:58,400
- Hon?
- Hmm?

189
00:10:58,400 --> 00:11:00,500
Did you set up the coffee maker?

190
00:11:00,500 --> 00:11:02,600
Oh, no.

191
00:11:02,600 --> 00:11:06,600
You know what? I'll do it in the morning.
I promise, I'll get up early and do it.

192
00:11:06,600 --> 00:11:09,100
- Tom...
- mm.

193
00:11:09,100 --> 00:11:12,700
Tom...come on.

194
00:11:15,100 --> 00:11:16,900
Thanks.

195
00:11:16,900 --> 00:11:18,800
Yeah.

196
00:11:48,700 --> 00:11:49,900
C laire?

197
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:55,800
I'm -- I'm, uh...

198
00:11:55,800 --> 00:11:59,200
wow, I'm sorry. I didn't know you were up.

199
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:02,400
Yeah, I- I thought you were sleeping.

200
00:12:02,600 --> 00:12:05,000
I was just going upstairs.

201
00:12:05,000 --> 00:12:06,600
Do you want me to make the coffee?

202
00:12:06,600 --> 00:12:10,100
Yeah. Yeah, that'd be great. Yeah.

203
00:12:10,800 --> 00:12:15,300
I'm just going to, um, I'm just,
you know, go back up to my room.

204
00:12:15,300 --> 00:12:16,600
Okay.

205
00:12:16,600 --> 00:12:18,200
All right.

206
00:12:19,000 --> 00:12:20,400
Good night.

207
00:12:20,400 --> 00:12:22,300
Good night.

208
00:12:25,900 --> 00:12:28,600
Also, you know, if we go to the mall,
we can go to the shoe store.

209
00:12:28,600 --> 00:12:31,300
You said you wanted new running shoes.

210
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:36,300
What?

211
00:12:36,800 --> 00:12:38,200
Oh.

212
00:12:48,600 --> 00:12:52,600
The next morning, while the search for
Martha Huber continued,

213
00:12:52,600 --> 00:12:55,300
Lynette discovered a little family secret --

214
00:12:55,300 --> 00:12:58,100
one she wasn't even looking for.

215
00:12:58,100 --> 00:12:59,500
Good morning.

216
00:12:59,500 --> 00:13:00,400
Morning.

217
00:13:00,400 --> 00:13:01,500
Want some coffee?

218
00:13:01,500 --> 00:13:03,500
Uh, yeah, thanks.

219
00:13:03,900 --> 00:13:07,200
I didn't want to come down till Tom left for work.

220
00:13:07,200 --> 00:13:09,200
I'm still a little embarrassed.

221
00:13:09,200 --> 00:13:10,800
About what?

222
00:13:11,200 --> 00:13:13,300
Oh, he didn't tell you?

223
00:13:13,300 --> 00:13:17,800
Well, actually, it's kind of funny.
Um...I was doing some laundry,

224
00:13:17,800 --> 00:13:21,500
and I noticed that the robe I was wearing
had some baby food on it,

225
00:13:21,500 --> 00:13:26,200
so I threw it in, figuring I could dash upstairs
while everyone was asleep,

226
00:13:26,200 --> 00:13:29,000
and then I ran into Tom

227
00:13:29,100 --> 00:13:31,300
while I was totally naked.

228
00:13:35,500 --> 00:13:40,500
And so, Claire, when did this incident occur?

229
00:13:40,700 --> 00:13:42,900
I don't know. It was pretty late.

230
00:13:42,900 --> 00:13:46,200
I think he might have come down to
make coffee or something.

231
00:13:47,900 --> 00:13:49,800
You don't say.

232
00:13:50,200 --> 00:13:52,000
Wow.

233
00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:53,800
Wow.

234
00:13:53,800 --> 00:13:58,500
Wow. Well, this is certainly impressive.
I can definitely get you work as a model,

235
00:13:58,500 --> 00:14:02,400
but you do realize it's different from the runway
work you did in New York and Milan.

236
00:14:02,400 --> 00:14:05,400
Of course. I made $10,000 a day.

237
00:14:05,400 --> 00:14:08,700
I don't expect to --to make that here.

238
00:14:08,700 --> 00:14:10,600
Well, that's good, because you won't.

239
00:14:10,600 --> 00:14:13,300
Yeah. So what do you got?

240
00:14:13,300 --> 00:14:15,200
Well, there is something.

241
00:14:15,200 --> 00:14:21,300
Uh, they need a model to demonstrate the
new buick lacrosse at the fairview mall.

242
00:14:21,300 --> 00:14:26,900
It's just going to be you and the car on
a revolving platform. 300 bucks for the day.

243
00:14:28,600 --> 00:14:30,700
Uh, what else do you have?

244
00:14:30,700 --> 00:14:31,800
Sure.

245
00:14:31,800 --> 00:14:35,800
Um... ooh. Can you swing a sword?

246
00:14:35,800 --> 00:14:40,800
Sci-fi convention needs someone
to dress up as a warrior princess.

247
00:14:41,100 --> 00:14:43,100
A warrior princess?

248
00:14:44,500 --> 00:14:47,900
Mr. Gibb, I am a professional model.

249
00:14:47,900 --> 00:14:49,700
Look at this bone structure.

250
00:14:49,700 --> 00:14:51,500
This face is a cash cow.

251
00:14:51,500 --> 00:14:55,500
And if you don't have the vision to take advantage
of that, then maybe I'm at the wrong agency.

252
00:14:55,500 --> 00:14:56,900
Hey, look, honey,

253
00:14:56,900 --> 00:14:59,300
I'm the only modeling agent in a 100-mile radius.

254
00:14:59,300 --> 00:15:02,600
I book women for boat shows and garden tool expos.

255
00:15:02,600 --> 00:15:06,000
If you don't like it, move back to the city.

256
00:15:10,400 --> 00:15:13,700
This, um, buick thing...

257
00:15:13,700 --> 00:15:16,100
does it include lunch?

258
00:15:19,800 --> 00:15:21,900
Just so you know,

259
00:15:22,400 --> 00:15:24,600
I really am grateful for everything you're doing for me.

260
00:15:24,600 --> 00:15:26,500
Oh, I don't need your gratitude.

261
00:15:26,500 --> 00:15:30,500
You're only here because your children
are master extortionists.

262
00:15:30,500 --> 00:15:31,900
So you didn't tell them about --

263
00:15:31,900 --> 00:15:36,600
your adultery? No, I decided to keep
that little gem all to myself.

264
00:15:37,100 --> 00:15:39,000
Listen, I know this is a real imposition --

265
00:15:39,000 --> 00:15:40,300
yes, it is.

266
00:15:40,300 --> 00:15:42,600
The doctor said you could be here for weeks.

267
00:15:42,600 --> 00:15:46,500
Would it make you feel any better
if I told you I'm sorry for what I did?

268
00:15:46,500 --> 00:15:48,500
Yes, it would...

269
00:15:48,500 --> 00:15:50,600
if I still felt anything for you.

270
00:15:50,600 --> 00:15:56,000
But as it stands, the place you used to occupy
in my heart is very much empty now.

271
00:15:56,700 --> 00:15:59,200
You must still feel something for me.

272
00:15:59,700 --> 00:16:01,300
And why do you think that?

273
00:16:01,300 --> 00:16:03,100
Oh, come on. Bree, look at this.

274
00:16:03,100 --> 00:16:08,000
You're using the good china,freshly pressed napkins,
flowers from the garden.

275
00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:11,200
This tray was prepared with loving care.

276
00:16:11,400 --> 00:16:13,000
Do me a favor, Rex --

277
00:16:13,000 --> 00:16:17,000
please don't mistake my anal retentiveness
for actual affection.

278
00:16:30,500 --> 00:16:32,300
Hold on a sec.

279
00:16:35,400 --> 00:16:37,900
Okay. Now I'm good.

280
00:16:39,000 --> 00:16:40,100
What?

281
00:16:40,100 --> 00:16:43,400
You're just --god, I love you.

282
00:16:44,500 --> 00:16:46,700
Oh.

283
00:16:47,500 --> 00:16:50,500
Well...that's great.

284
00:16:50,500 --> 00:16:52,400
Wait, look, that just kind of popped out.

285
00:16:52,400 --> 00:16:55,800
No, no, it's fine. It just kind of caught me off-guard.

286
00:16:56,600 --> 00:16:58,200
I mean, I want to say it back.

287
00:16:58,200 --> 00:17:00,600
Yeah, but you're not ready. It's okay.

288
00:17:00,600 --> 00:17:01,800
You're not mad, are you?

289
00:17:01,800 --> 00:17:05,600
No, god. We haven't even been dating that long,
and you've got other issues. I get it.

290
00:17:05,600 --> 00:17:06,800
Good.

291
00:17:09,500 --> 00:17:11,400
Issues? What kind of issues do you think I have?

292
00:17:11,400 --> 00:17:14,700
You know, I retract my earlier statement.
I no longer love you.

293
00:17:14,700 --> 00:17:16,600
In fact, I just think of you as a really good buddy.

294
00:17:16,600 --> 00:17:20,300
No. No, no, no, no. You obviously think
you have some insight into my soul,

295
00:17:20,300 --> 00:17:23,200
so please go ahead. Dazzle me.

296
00:17:23,200 --> 00:17:26,100
Your divorce left you hurt and vulnerable.

297
00:17:26,100 --> 00:17:27,800
Big insight. The postman knows that.

298
00:17:27,800 --> 00:17:31,600
And there's a chance you might still
have feelings for your ex.

299
00:17:31,600 --> 00:17:33,100
What?

300
00:17:33,800 --> 00:17:35,900
I loathe Karl,

301
00:17:35,900 --> 00:17:37,900
and the postman will back me up on that, too.

302
00:17:37,900 --> 00:17:42,500
I'm sure part of you does hate him, but, well,
maybe part of you is still hung up on him.

303
00:17:42,500 --> 00:17:43,900
Where are you getting this?

304
00:17:43,900 --> 00:17:46,100
Well, he broke up with the woman he left you for,

305
00:17:46,100 --> 00:17:49,400
and what was the first thing you did?
You hugged him

306
00:17:49,400 --> 00:17:51,400
and invited him to a party.

307
00:17:51,400 --> 00:17:53,500
Okay.

308
00:17:53,500 --> 00:17:57,800
The analysis part of this evening is now over.

309
00:17:58,200 --> 00:18:00,600
Hey... you asked.

310
00:18:00,600 --> 00:18:02,500
Well, you know what?

311
00:18:02,500 --> 00:18:04,600
You're going to come to julie's party tomorrow night,

312
00:18:04,600 --> 00:18:06,300
and you're going to see Karl and I together,

313
00:18:06,300 --> 00:18:09,900
and you're going to understand once and for all
that I have no feelings for him whatsoever.

314
00:18:09,900 --> 00:18:11,000
Well, actually, I have tickets to a basketball game --

315
00:18:11,000 --> 00:18:14,400
well, actually, you're coming to the party tomorrow,
and that's the end of it.

316
00:18:14,400 --> 00:18:16,200
This is what I get for saying "I love you."

317
00:18:16,200 --> 00:18:17,100
What?

318
00:18:17,100 --> 00:18:18,500
Nothing.

319
00:18:21,500 --> 00:18:22,600
There you go.

320
00:18:22,600 --> 00:18:24,000
Hello, George.

321
00:18:24,000 --> 00:18:26,000
Mrs. Van De Kamp. You're looking lovely today.

322
00:18:26,000 --> 00:18:28,600
You always say the nicest things.

323
00:18:28,600 --> 00:18:31,600
Well, it's, uh, it's true.

324
00:18:31,700 --> 00:18:36,300
Listen, I have a prescription here for Rex.
I don't know if you heard, but he had a heart attack.

325
00:18:36,300 --> 00:18:37,600
I had no idea. Is he okay?

326
00:18:37,600 --> 00:18:43,100
Oh, yes, he'll --he'll live, but, uh, the doctor says
he's at risk for something called pericarditis.

327
00:18:43,100 --> 00:18:44,300
Do you know anything about that?

328
00:18:44,300 --> 00:18:47,400
It's an inflammation of the membrane
that surrounds the heart.

329
00:18:47,400 --> 00:18:51,100
It'll take a few months to make sure it doesn't develop,
but he'll need constant care.

330
00:18:51,100 --> 00:18:53,100
So I hear.

331
00:18:53,500 --> 00:18:57,500
As the words "constant care" echoed in her head,

332
00:18:57,500 --> 00:19:01,600
Bree caught a sickening glimpse into her future...

333
00:19:01,600 --> 00:19:03,000
okay, here we go.

334
00:19:03,000 --> 00:19:07,600
Which prompted her to seek an old-fashioned remedy.

335
00:19:07,700 --> 00:19:10,800
George, would you go out to dinner with me?

336
00:19:10,800 --> 00:19:13,700
Um, y-you mean like a date?

337
00:19:13,700 --> 00:19:16,100
Yes. I think it would be fun.

338
00:19:16,100 --> 00:19:18,400
What about your husband?

339
00:19:18,400 --> 00:19:20,700
Oh, him.

340
00:19:20,700 --> 00:19:23,800
Well, we're separated.

341
00:19:27,900 --> 00:19:34,000
In spite of Mrs. Huber's disappearance,
life on Wisteria Lane started to return to normal

342
00:19:34,000 --> 00:19:39,900
until an intriguing discovery was made
on a dirt road next to the interstate.

343
00:19:41,300 --> 00:19:42,500
This is officer burton.

344
00:19:42,500 --> 00:19:47,600
I have an abandoned vehicle registered to a missing
person. One Martha Huber. Please advise.

345
00:19:50,200 --> 00:19:56,600
As news spread of this mysterious development,
everyone in the neighborhood decided to band together

346
00:19:57,100 --> 00:20:00,900
to show their support and to look for clues...

347
00:20:00,900 --> 00:20:02,600
or worse.

348
00:20:02,600 --> 00:20:04,700
I'm keeping my eyes on the horizon.

349
00:20:04,700 --> 00:20:07,400
Please tell me if I am about to step on a body part.

350
00:20:07,400 --> 00:20:10,300
It's a search and rescue, not recover.
We don't know if she's dead.

351
00:20:10,300 --> 00:20:12,900
Yeah, people fake their own abductions all the time.

352
00:20:12,900 --> 00:20:15,900
Could we talk about something else,
something less depressing?

353
00:20:15,900 --> 00:20:18,800
Well, here's something -- Mike told me he loved me.

354
00:20:19,000 --> 00:20:20,000
Oh, my god!

355
00:20:20,000 --> 00:20:21,600
Over here! They found the body!

356
00:20:21,600 --> 00:20:24,700
No, I'm sorry! False alarm! We didn't find a body.

357
00:20:24,700 --> 00:20:27,800
Uh, Susan just had some really good news.

358
00:20:28,200 --> 00:20:31,200
- Sorry.
- It was nothing. False alarm.

359
00:20:31,200 --> 00:20:35,900
Well, doesn't that figure.
Susan always finds a way to make it about her.

360
00:20:38,300 --> 00:20:43,800
Ladies and gentlemen, I present to you
the fabulous buick lacrosse.

361
00:20:48,100 --> 00:20:52,400
It -- it has expertly crafted interior,

362
00:20:52,400 --> 00:20:58,000
peaceful, quiet tuning, and ultra sonic rear parking assist.

363
00:20:58,100 --> 00:21:01,300
Observe the remote activation feature.

364
00:21:06,400 --> 00:21:11,800
Uh, and it also has a lot of other exciting,
good, cool car things.

365
00:21:28,400 --> 00:21:32,200
Tom, Lynette. What are you doing here?

366
00:21:32,200 --> 00:21:34,900
We're buying a new water heater. Um, how about you?

367
00:21:34,900 --> 00:21:37,300
Just doing a little shopping,
trying to get my mind off things.

368
00:21:37,300 --> 00:21:39,400
Hey, Gabby, you need help?
It looks like you're stuck here.

369
00:21:39,400 --> 00:21:40,600
Oh, I guess I am.

370
00:21:40,600 --> 00:21:44,300
- No worries. I got it.
- Guess I got too close to the turntable.

371
00:21:44,300 --> 00:21:46,000
I'm a sucker for these buicks.

372
00:21:46,000 --> 00:21:47,500
Come on, you bastard.

373
00:21:47,500 --> 00:21:53,500
You know, with their, uh, perfectly crafted
interior and peaceful, quiet tuning.

374
00:21:53,500 --> 00:21:55,200
Uh-huh.

375
00:21:55,200 --> 00:21:57,300
Little formal for the mall.

376
00:21:57,300 --> 00:22:02,900
Oh, uh, you know, I-I wanted to match
the shoes to the dress.

377
00:22:04,000 --> 00:22:06,000
This is, uh, sarah,

378
00:22:06,000 --> 00:22:10,400
my shopping buddy. We like to hitthe boutiques together.

379
00:22:10,400 --> 00:22:16,200
Okay, well, you gals, um, shop your little hearts out.
See you later.

380
00:22:16,200 --> 00:22:18,900
Bye.

381
00:22:28,100 --> 00:22:31,500
Wow. Look at you. You going out?

382
00:22:31,500 --> 00:22:35,600
Not that it's any of your business, but, um, I have a date.

383
00:22:35,600 --> 00:22:37,600
A date? What kind of date?

384
00:22:37,600 --> 00:22:39,800
Rex, I don't want to say anything that might upset you.

385
00:22:39,800 --> 00:22:43,500
The doctor says any undue stress could
cause another heart attack.

386
00:22:48,800 --> 00:22:54,100
It's a romantic date with a single, attractive man,
and I intend to french the hell out of him.

387
00:22:55,000 --> 00:22:57,400
Oh, right on time.

388
00:22:59,700 --> 00:23:01,000
- Hi.
- Hi.

389
00:23:01,000 --> 00:23:04,100
In my spare time, I garden. I thought you might like these.

390
00:23:04,100 --> 00:23:06,800
Oh, my. They're exquisite.

391
00:23:06,800 --> 00:23:08,500
Compost and eggshells?

392
00:23:08,500 --> 00:23:09,700
Yes.

393
00:23:09,700 --> 00:23:10,900
Oh. Come on in.

394
00:23:10,900 --> 00:23:12,600
Thanks.

395
00:23:14,400 --> 00:23:17,100
George, you remember Rex.

396
00:23:19,700 --> 00:23:21,100
Uh, I thought you said you were separated.

397
00:23:21,100 --> 00:23:26,100
Oh, we are, emotionally. Physically, he just lives here
because his mistress refuses to care for him.

398
00:23:26,100 --> 00:23:27,700
Would you like a drink?

399
00:23:27,700 --> 00:23:31,000
Uh, no, I-I'm fine, thanks.

400
00:23:31,000 --> 00:23:33,300
Rex, say hello to George.

401
00:23:33,300 --> 00:23:34,600
Hello, George.

402
00:23:34,600 --> 00:23:35,900
Hello, Dr. Van De Kamp.

403
00:23:35,900 --> 00:23:37,600
I'm going to go put these in water.

404
00:23:37,600 --> 00:23:42,100
George, why don't you have a seat,
and I'll be right back?

405
00:23:50,400 --> 00:23:53,100
So, uh, how's your heart, Dr. Van De Kamp?

406
00:23:53,100 --> 00:23:57,300
- Better. How's the pharmacy? - Busy. It's busy.

407
00:24:03,900 --> 00:24:04,700
Is something funny?

408
00:24:04,700 --> 00:24:07,400
It's -- it's nothing.

409
00:24:07,400 --> 00:24:13,000
See, I, uh...I recently engaged in
some extracurricular activity,

410
00:24:13,000 --> 00:24:16,600
and now bree's doing anything
she can to make me suffer

411
00:24:16,700 --> 00:24:18,800
All you can do is laugh.

412
00:24:18,800 --> 00:24:21,300
Yeah. I-I guess.

413
00:24:21,800 --> 00:24:27,200
Oh, these flowers are stunning.
They're the best ones I've ever gotten.

414
00:24:31,200 --> 00:24:32,100
Shall we?

415
00:24:32,100 --> 00:24:34,200
Well, it was nice talking to you, Dr. Van De Kamp.

416
00:24:34,200 --> 00:24:37,800
Please. You're dating my wife. Call me Rex.

417
00:24:42,400 --> 00:24:45,600
That salesgirl that sold us the water heater --
she had a cute figure.

418
00:24:45,600 --> 00:24:46,900
Yeah, I guess. I didn't notice.

419
00:24:46,900 --> 00:24:51,500
Oh, how can you say? She was so your type--
big breasts, really curvy.

420
00:24:51,800 --> 00:24:52,600
What are you doing?

421
00:24:52,600 --> 00:24:57,900
Nothing. I'm just saying you prefer women who are
really curvy, women like that salesgirl or Claire.

422
00:24:58,600 --> 00:25:01,600
There's only one type that I prefer.

423
00:25:01,600 --> 00:25:02,500
You.

424
00:25:02,500 --> 00:25:06,500
Aw, you kissed me as though that would
end this conversation, and it so won't.

425
00:25:06,500 --> 00:25:09,200
Why am I in trouble? I haven't done anything wrong.

426
00:25:09,200 --> 00:25:13,400
The only reason you made love to me the other night
was because you had just seen claire naked.

427
00:25:15,500 --> 00:25:17,500
aw, crap.

428
00:25:17,900 --> 00:25:21,800
Claire is a great nanny. It would be stupid
to lose her over something like this.

429
00:25:21,800 --> 00:25:25,000
You and I have had crushes before.
We always tell each other.

430
00:25:25,000 --> 00:25:26,600
We laugh about it. It's no big deal.

431
00:25:26,600 --> 00:25:29,500
What worries me about this is you're denying
you're obviously attracted. Why?

432
00:25:29,500 --> 00:25:31,200
I'm not denying anything.

433
00:25:31,200 --> 00:25:32,800
Oh, so you are attracted to her.

434
00:25:32,800 --> 00:25:35,000
I didn't say that.

435
00:25:36,100 --> 00:25:37,300
What are you doing?

436
00:25:37,300 --> 00:25:41,200
We are not going anywhere until you confess
you have the hots for our nanny.

437
00:25:41,200 --> 00:25:44,000
Tom, it's okay. She's attractive.

438
00:25:44,000 --> 00:25:48,800
Men by nature are drawn to fertile young women
with whom they can plant their seed.

439
00:25:48,800 --> 00:25:53,800
It's the basic flaw of your gender.
I get it. Just do me the honor of --

440
00:25:56,800 --> 00:25:59,400
we'd all like to get out of here. Is there a problem?

441
00:25:59,400 --> 00:26:02,800
My husband won't admit that he has lust in his heart.

442
00:26:02,800 --> 00:26:04,700
Can you give us a minute?

443
00:26:07,500 --> 00:26:12,100
Lynette, Claire is attractive, yes.

444
00:26:12,500 --> 00:26:14,800
But I am not attracted to her.

445
00:26:14,800 --> 00:26:19,300
Look, if I thought for even a second that
there was any danger in having Claire around,

446
00:26:19,300 --> 00:26:20,800
I'd be the first to get rid of her.

447
00:26:20,800 --> 00:26:23,900
It's you. You're the one.

448
00:26:23,900 --> 00:26:27,600
You always have been, and you always will be.

449
00:26:30,400 --> 00:26:33,700
All right. Hold your water.

450
00:26:36,700 --> 00:26:42,000
Then as a coda, we drink ice cream soda
here down at the old five and dime, yeah

451
00:26:46,800 --> 00:26:48,100
yay. Oh, you guys were fantastic.

452
00:26:48,100 --> 00:26:49,500
Thank you.

453
00:26:49,500 --> 00:26:52,200
Um, they've got a dance floor upstairs,
and we're going to go check it out.

454
00:26:52,200 --> 00:26:53,500
Okay. Have fun.

455
00:26:57,500 --> 00:26:59,500
Edie. Over here.

456
00:26:59,900 --> 00:27:01,000
What the hell is she doing here?

457
00:27:01,000 --> 00:27:04,700
What, I don't get to bring a date?
I heard you were bringing him.

458
00:27:04,700 --> 00:27:07,600
Of all people, you pick that tired piece of --

459
00:27:07,600 --> 00:27:08,700
- Edie. - Hi, Susan.

460
00:27:08,700 --> 00:27:10,900
Oh, thank you so much for the invite.

461
00:27:10,900 --> 00:27:14,900
God knows I needed something to
get my mind off poor Martha.

462
00:27:14,900 --> 00:27:18,300
A kiss for the birthday boy.

463
00:27:24,200 --> 00:27:27,200
Um, Edie, it's not his birthday.

464
00:27:29,900 --> 00:27:33,500
Oh. Oh.

465
00:27:34,800 --> 00:27:37,300
Thank you, George. That was a lovely evening.

466
00:27:37,300 --> 00:27:38,800
The pleasure was mine.

467
00:27:38,800 --> 00:27:45,000
There's nothing better than great conversation
with a beautiful woman over a delicious meal.

468
00:27:47,500 --> 00:27:49,800
Well, I guess I should go inside.

469
00:27:49,800 --> 00:27:51,300
I'm glad we did this.

470
00:27:51,300 --> 00:27:53,000
Me too.

471
00:27:58,100 --> 00:28:01,000
Andrew. Where did you come from?

472
00:28:01,000 --> 00:28:04,600
I was just on my wayback from brian's house.
What's going on here?

473
00:28:04,600 --> 00:28:08,000
Oh, uh, you remember Mr. Williams, our pharmacist.

474
00:28:08,000 --> 00:28:10,300
- Hey there.
- How's it going?

475
00:28:10,300 --> 00:28:11,700
What are you doing in his car?

476
00:28:11,700 --> 00:28:18,300
We're just, um, talking.
Mr. Williams took me out to dinner.

477
00:28:18,300 --> 00:28:20,600
You mean like on a date?

478
00:28:21,000 --> 00:28:23,500
Well, um...

479
00:28:26,200 --> 00:28:27,700
Yes.

480
00:28:27,900 --> 00:28:30,300
You are aware that she's married, right?

481
00:28:30,300 --> 00:28:33,300
Andrew, your father and I are separated, and you know it.

482
00:28:33,300 --> 00:28:35,900
I don't care. Couldn't you at least wait
until he was out of the house?

483
00:28:35,900 --> 00:28:39,500
The only reason he's still in the house is
because you insisted I care for him.

484
00:28:39,600 --> 00:28:41,700
So -- so what, what are you guys going to do now?

485
00:28:41,700 --> 00:28:43,700
Are you -- are you two going to have sex?

486
00:28:43,700 --> 00:28:45,900
- No, we are not going to have sex.
- Why not?

487
00:28:45,900 --> 00:28:48,800
Because I don't commit adultery like your father.

488
00:28:54,200 --> 00:29:00,100
That's right. Your father had an affair, I found out about it,
and I'm just trying to move on with my life.

489
00:29:02,400 --> 00:29:06,400
You should watch out for her. She's a liar.

490
00:29:06,400 --> 00:29:07,900
Andrew...

491
00:29:19,000 --> 00:29:21,200
In spite of her mounting debt,

492
00:29:21,200 --> 00:29:26,700
Gabrielle was determined to prove she could
get along just fine without Carlos's money.

493
00:29:29,500 --> 00:29:32,900
It wasn't until the electricity went out

494
00:29:32,900 --> 00:29:36,600
that she finally began to see the light.

495
00:29:46,500 --> 00:29:49,700
Mr. Hartley, it's Gabrielle Solis.

496
00:29:49,700 --> 00:29:53,600
I need you to start working on releasing Carlos on bail.

497
00:29:55,400 --> 00:29:58,900
I just remembered where I put his passport.

498
00:29:58,900 --> 00:30:01,800
But I, I took the sweet life

499
00:30:01,800 --> 00:30:06,700
never knew I'd be bitter from the sweet

500
00:30:06,700 --> 00:30:12,100
I spent my life exploring the subtle whoring

501
00:30:12,100 --> 00:30:15,400
that costs too much to be free

502
00:30:15,400 --> 00:30:17,700
hey, lady

503
00:30:17,700 --> 00:30:23,300
I've been to paradise

504
00:30:25,800 --> 00:30:32,400
but I've never been

505
00:30:32,400 --> 00:30:40,300
to me

506
00:30:42,000 --> 00:30:44,300
Oh, thank you.

507
00:30:44,300 --> 00:30:47,300
Damn, woman. You were good.

508
00:30:49,100 --> 00:30:53,100
Yes. All right, you're next, susie Q.
What you going to sing?

509
00:30:53,100 --> 00:30:53,900
Yes

510
00:30:53,900 --> 00:30:54,700
You sing?

511
00:30:54,700 --> 00:30:56,100
Only when I'm alone.

512
00:30:56,100 --> 00:30:57,500
Come on. We're among friends.

513
00:30:57,500 --> 00:30:58,600
I don't think so.

514
00:30:58,600 --> 00:31:01,700
Well, I, for one, would love to hear your voice.

515
00:31:01,700 --> 00:31:04,400
Give it up, plumber. She's not budging.

516
00:31:05,200 --> 00:31:06,300
You want to hear me sing?

517
00:31:06,300 --> 00:31:07,300
Yeah.

518
00:31:07,300 --> 00:31:09,000
Okay.

519
00:31:12,300 --> 00:31:15,300
What's it going to be? I'll tell the piano player.

520
00:31:15,500 --> 00:31:16,500
"New york, new york."

521
00:31:16,500 --> 00:31:19,600
Oh, I am so excited to hear you.

522
00:31:19,600 --> 00:31:22,300
Oh, but doesn't it just figure?

523
00:31:22,300 --> 00:31:23,300
What do you mean?

524
00:31:23,300 --> 00:31:27,100
You have to get up in front of a room
full of people dressed like that.

525
00:31:28,300 --> 00:31:30,800
I hope they don't turn on you.

526
00:31:30,800 --> 00:31:34,600
I think I'll take my chances, sort of like
you did on those high notes.

527
00:31:36,700 --> 00:31:37,800
I'm going to get us two more.

528
00:31:37,800 --> 00:31:39,400
That's a great idea.

529
00:31:39,800 --> 00:31:43,100
So that Mike -- he seems pretty even-keeled.

530
00:31:43,100 --> 00:31:44,900
Yeah. He's a great guy.

531
00:31:44,900 --> 00:31:48,600
But you know, I mean, he's a little buster brown.

532
00:31:48,600 --> 00:31:50,700
Don't you ever worry you're going to get bored?

533
00:31:50,700 --> 00:31:53,200
Thanks for your concern, Karl. I'm fine.

534
00:31:53,200 --> 00:31:55,000
Go figure.

535
00:31:55,000 --> 00:31:58,500
Even though our marriage was crazy
at times, it never got dull.

536
00:31:58,500 --> 00:32:02,500
Yeah, that part when you slept with
your secretary was really exciting.

537
00:32:02,500 --> 00:32:06,600
I know. How many times do I have to hear it?
It was a mistake.

538
00:32:06,600 --> 00:32:11,100
But don't I ever get credit for the 13 loyal
years beforehand?

539
00:32:11,200 --> 00:32:14,200
You must not be counting
the Hendersons' christmas party.

540
00:32:14,200 --> 00:32:15,700
Edie, not now.

541
00:32:15,700 --> 00:32:19,300
Oh, what's the big deal, Karl?
Your marriage is history anyway.

542
00:32:19,300 --> 00:32:19,800
Edie.

543
00:32:19,800 --> 00:32:24,500
It was nothing, really.
Basically, we both got plastered on eggnog,

544
00:32:24,500 --> 00:32:28,200
and we found ourselves standing under the, uh, mistletoe,

545
00:32:28,200 --> 00:32:31,200
and we were like, "okay, well, what do we do now?"

546
00:32:31,200 --> 00:32:39,400
So I smiled, and he smiled, and then Karl
reached over and started feeling me up.

547
00:32:39,400 --> 00:32:41,300
- Susie, that's not how it happened.
- All right, Susan, come on, you're up.

548
00:32:41,300 --> 00:32:42,000
What?

549
00:32:42,000 --> 00:32:43,600
This is --it's so silly.

550
00:32:43,600 --> 00:32:44,300
Susie --

551
00:32:44,300 --> 00:32:48,100
Ladies and gentlemen, please welcome Susan Mayer.

552
00:32:59,800 --> 00:33:03,500
Start spreadin' the news

553
00:33:03,500 --> 00:33:07,200
I'm leavin' today

554
00:33:07,200 --> 00:33:10,800
I wanna be a part of it

555
00:33:10,800 --> 00:33:14,600
new york, new york

556
00:33:14,600 --> 00:33:17,400
these vagabond shoes

557
00:33:17,400 --> 00:33:20,200
you're an ass, you know that?
No, keep playing.

558
00:33:20,200 --> 00:33:22,700
Are longing to stray

559
00:33:22,700 --> 00:33:24,500
there's a word, you know, right?

560
00:33:24,500 --> 00:33:27,800
And get around the heart of it

561
00:33:27,800 --> 00:33:31,600
new york, new york

562
00:33:31,600 --> 00:33:33,500
I wanna

563
00:33:33,500 --> 00:33:36,400
just tell you that the affair was one thing.

564
00:33:36,400 --> 00:33:38,700
I mean, I forgave you, because on some small level,

565
00:33:38,700 --> 00:33:40,300
I thought that you were in love with her,

566
00:33:40,300 --> 00:33:44,300
and now I find out that you were
just groping people at parties.

567
00:33:44,300 --> 00:33:47,600
Top of the heap

568
00:33:47,600 --> 00:33:51,000
Karl, don't you turn away from me. Look at me!

569
00:33:52,800 --> 00:33:54,200
You know, what else were you doing during our marriage?

570
00:33:54,200 --> 00:33:56,600
How many other women were you sticking it to?

571
00:33:56,600 --> 00:34:03,800
As god is my witness, it will snow on the hills of hell
before I ever feel sorry for you again!

572
00:34:09,900 --> 00:34:12,900
New york

573
00:34:16,200 --> 00:34:23,100
As the police interviewed the residents of Wisteria Lane
about the mysterious disappearance of Martha Huber,

574
00:34:23,100 --> 00:34:31,300
my husband Paul reasoned it would only be a matter of
time before their digging would begin to yield answers.

575
00:34:52,700 --> 00:34:56,500
Since he knew the police had no suspects,

576
00:34:57,700 --> 00:35:03,000
he decided to point them towards
the most logical candidate.

577
00:35:06,400 --> 00:35:13,200
You see, if there's one thing Paul understood
about the suburbs, it was this --

578
00:35:13,600 --> 00:35:17,400
no one's ever more suspicious

579
00:35:17,400 --> 00:35:22,600
than a new neighbor who's just moved in.

580
00:35:23,800 --> 00:35:25,600
Parker's getting sniffly.

581
00:35:25,600 --> 00:35:30,000
Yeah, I noticed that, too.
I hope he's not coming down with a cold.

582
00:35:30,000 --> 00:35:36,500
He doesn't have a cough yet,
but he sort of has this post-nasal drip thing happening.

583
00:35:36,500 --> 00:35:38,200
I'll make an appointment for him.

584
00:35:38,200 --> 00:35:41,700
I always say it is better to be safe than sorry.

585
00:35:41,700 --> 00:35:45,700
Little kids get sick, and it's -- sorry --out of control...

586
00:35:45,700 --> 00:35:56,800
man, kids with these colds,
it's just -- just this vicious cycle.

587
00:36:09,100 --> 00:36:11,500
Um, um, Claire?

588
00:36:14,600 --> 00:36:17,000
We have to make some changes.

589
00:36:21,400 --> 00:36:22,000
What are you doing?

590
00:36:22,000 --> 00:36:25,900
I'm packing up your father's things
for when he eventually moves out.

591
00:36:25,900 --> 00:36:29,000
Well, here. Let me help you.

592
00:36:30,900 --> 00:36:34,100
Look, I-I talked to dad,

593
00:36:34,100 --> 00:36:37,000
and it turns out you were telling the truth.

594
00:36:39,800 --> 00:36:43,100
Oh, andrew, I'm so sorry that I said anything.

595
00:36:43,100 --> 00:36:46,800
No, you know, I'm glad you did. Now I know.

596
00:36:47,500 --> 00:36:49,900
There comes this point in every boy's life.

597
00:36:49,900 --> 00:36:53,500
What, finding out his dad's screwing around?

598
00:36:53,900 --> 00:36:55,100
No.

599
00:36:55,100 --> 00:36:57,500
That his father's only human.

600
00:36:59,200 --> 00:37:01,900
Listen, why are you taking care of him?

601
00:37:01,900 --> 00:37:04,900
Is it because of what Danielle and I said?
Because you can forget that.

602
00:37:04,900 --> 00:37:07,400
I'll help you take his stuff out on the street if you want.

603
00:37:07,400 --> 00:37:11,200
That's sweet, but I'm taking care of him
because it's the right thing to do.

604
00:37:11,700 --> 00:37:14,400
Why are you being such a push over?

605
00:37:14,800 --> 00:37:16,500
I mean, he cheated on you.

606
00:37:16,500 --> 00:37:18,200
He's a jerk.

607
00:37:18,200 --> 00:37:19,700
Andrew...

608
00:37:20,100 --> 00:37:23,400
you will not speak that way about your father in front of me.

609
00:37:23,400 --> 00:37:27,400
Why the hell not? I mean, for once, I'm actually on your side.

610
00:37:27,400 --> 00:37:29,100
Yes, I'm angry with him.

611
00:37:29,100 --> 00:37:31,300
I am going to divorce him. I may even marry somebody else.

612
00:37:31,300 --> 00:37:36,700
But make no mistake about it, your father
is and always will be the love of my life.

613
00:37:38,100 --> 00:37:42,600
He gave me the best18-year marriage that...

614
00:37:44,000 --> 00:37:46,500
I could have ever hoped for.

615
00:37:49,200 --> 00:37:51,800
And for that, you will respect him.

616
00:37:52,800 --> 00:37:54,200
Okay

617
00:38:13,600 --> 00:38:15,500
What is it? I'm really, really busy.

618
00:38:15,500 --> 00:38:17,900
I came by to apologize.

619
00:38:17,900 --> 00:38:22,900
Oh. Well, in that case, come on in. I'm not doing anything.

620
00:38:26,900 --> 00:38:29,900
I can't believe Edie brought the whole thing up.

621
00:38:30,200 --> 00:38:33,500
Susan... I-I am so sorry.

622
00:38:33,500 --> 00:38:35,500
I-I thought I was done hurting you.

623
00:38:35,500 --> 00:38:37,100
Yeah, me too.

624
00:38:38,900 --> 00:38:40,800
And just so you know,

625
00:38:40,800 --> 00:38:43,600
I'm sorry for flipping out.

626
00:38:43,600 --> 00:38:46,300
I shouldn't let you get to me like that.

627
00:38:49,000 --> 00:38:50,000
What?

628
00:38:50,000 --> 00:38:51,800
I do still get to you, don't I?

629
00:38:51,800 --> 00:38:54,700
That's the difference between the plumber and me.

630
00:38:54,700 --> 00:38:58,400
No, don't get me wrong, he's a good guy.
I mean, I like him.

631
00:38:58,400 --> 00:39:01,800
But I'm betting that you two don't
have what we had together.

632
00:39:01,800 --> 00:39:04,600
There was always a spark between us.

633
00:39:04,600 --> 00:39:06,500
A spark?

634
00:39:06,500 --> 00:39:11,100
Look, what I'm trying to say is
he must seem really safe after me.

635
00:39:11,100 --> 00:39:14,100
A moray eel would seem safe after you.

636
00:39:15,500 --> 00:39:20,700
That's what I'm talking about -- that great
back-and-forth, the joking around...

637
00:39:20,700 --> 00:39:24,500
we still argue and push each other's buttons.

638
00:39:24,500 --> 00:39:27,200
News flash --I hated all of that.

639
00:39:27,200 --> 00:39:29,800
Come on, you have to admit when it was good,

640
00:39:29,800 --> 00:39:32,100
it was the best.

641
00:39:32,100 --> 00:39:34,000
What are you saying?

642
00:39:34,800 --> 00:39:37,400
Let's give this another shot.

643
00:39:38,700 --> 00:39:39,900
You want me back?

644
00:39:39,900 --> 00:39:41,900
Yeah.

645
00:39:41,900 --> 00:39:45,000
Yeah. I realize now

646
00:39:45,000 --> 00:39:50,500
that you were the woman that was meant for me.

647
00:39:51,300 --> 00:39:54,400
Wow.

648
00:39:54,900 --> 00:39:56,200
W-w-- just so we're clear,

649
00:39:56,200 --> 00:40:03,900
so -- so you want to move back in here and -- and be
faithful to me and love me with all your heart and soul?

650
00:40:04,000 --> 00:40:05,500
Absolutely.

651
00:40:05,500 --> 00:40:08,000
Oh, my god. This is so wonderful.

652
00:40:08,000 --> 00:40:10,900
Yeah. I know, I know.

653
00:40:11,700 --> 00:40:12,800
I want to kiss you.

654
00:40:12,800 --> 00:40:16,500
Oh, god. No, Karl. Um, no,

655
00:40:16,500 --> 00:40:23,400
what I meant by wonderful was that I wondered inside if I
still had feelings for you,
if deep down, I still loved you.

656
00:40:23,400 --> 00:40:24,100
And?

657
00:40:24,100 --> 00:40:26,500
And --

658
00:40:26,600 --> 00:40:28,300
There's nothing there.

659
00:40:28,300 --> 00:40:30,300
Come on. You've got to feel something.

660
00:40:30,300 --> 00:40:34,400
Well, actually, I do, yeah. Excuse me.

661
00:40:35,400 --> 00:40:38,000
Oh, my god.

662
00:40:52,100 --> 00:40:52,900
Susan.

663
00:40:52,900 --> 00:40:54,800
Mike, guess what.

664
00:40:54,800 --> 00:40:56,300
I love you.

665
00:40:56,300 --> 00:40:57,400
Are you sure?

666
00:40:57,400 --> 00:40:59,300
Yes.

667
00:41:05,600 --> 00:41:06,800
Did I come at a bad time?

668
00:41:06,800 --> 00:41:10,100
Um, they're just asking some
questions about Mrs. Huber.

669
00:41:11,200 --> 00:41:14,200
I love him. You can write that in your little book.

670
00:41:18,500 --> 00:41:21,600
We are all searching for someone,

671
00:41:21,600 --> 00:41:26,900
that special person who will provide us
what's missing in our lives.

672
00:41:26,900 --> 00:41:29,500
Someone who can offer companionship...

673
00:41:29,500 --> 00:41:33,900
George? Hi, it's me -- Bree.

674
00:41:33,900 --> 00:41:36,600
I was wondering, are you free next saturday?

675
00:41:37,300 --> 00:41:40,100
You are? Oh, that's wonderful.

676
00:41:40,100 --> 00:41:41,500
Or assistance...

677
00:41:41,500 --> 00:41:45,600
hi. I understand your agency handles nannies.

678
00:41:45,800 --> 00:41:50,600
I need someone experienced and preferably unattractive.

679
00:41:52,300 --> 00:41:53,400
Or security.

680
00:41:53,400 --> 00:41:56,700
Hi, honey. Did the lawyer tell you the good news?

00:41:56,700 --> 00:42:01,200
You're going to make bail. I found your passport.

682
00:42:01,200 --> 00:42:06,100
And sometimes, if we search very hard,
we can find someone who provides us...

683
00:42:06,100 --> 00:42:09,200
well, I just called to say hi, and I love you.

684
00:42:09,200 --> 00:42:11,300
With all three.

685
00:42:11,300 --> 00:42:15,200
All right, all right. Enough already.

686
00:42:18,200 --> 00:42:21,600
Yes, we're all searching for someone,

687
00:42:21,600 --> 00:42:24,000
and if we can't find them,

688
00:42:24,000 --> 00:42:25,900
we can only pray

689
00:42:25,900 --> 00:42:28,000
they find us.

690
00:42:28,000 --> 00:42:29,600
What you got, boy?
