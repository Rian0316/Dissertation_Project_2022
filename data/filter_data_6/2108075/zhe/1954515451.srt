1
00:00:00,370 --> 00:00:02,960
<i>2011年秋天  莉莉和马修收到</i>
<i>In the fall of 2011, Lily and Marshall received</i>

2
00:00:02,960 --> 00:00:05,470
<i>一份莉莉祖父母送的惊喜大礼</i>
<i>a surprising gift from Lily's grandparents:</i>

3
00:00:05,530 --> 00:00:06,980
<i>一座长岛的房子</i>
<i>their house in Long Island.</i>

4
00:00:06,980 --> 00:00:08,900
<i>莉莉和马修因为一个简单的理由</i>
<i>Lily and Marshall decided to sell it </i>

5
00:00:08,900 --> 00:00:10,960
<i>决定将其出售</i>
<i>for one simple reason.</i>

6
00:00:10,960 --> 00:00:12,250
那可是在长岛啊
It's Long Island.

7
00:00:12,250 --> 00:00:14,720
我可不想在长岛度周六
I don't want to spend my Saturday in Long Island.

8
00:00:14,720 --> 00:00:15,740
我知道  宝贝
I know, babe,

9
00:00:15,740 --> 00:00:18,010
但是中介在房子里布置了些道具家具
but the realtor staged the place with fake furniture

10
00:00:18,010 --> 00:00:20,040
她想在开售前  让我们去看看
and she wants us to check it out before the open house.

11
00:00:20,040 --> 00:00:21,370
好吧
All right.

12
00:00:21,370 --> 00:00:23,510
至少我们能在道具床上做爱吧
Can we at least do it on the fake bed?

13
00:00:23,660 --> 00:00:25,960
这种求欢的事还是我来吧
I'm embarrassed that you have to ask.

14
00:00:26,690 --> 00:00:28,230
<i>于是他们出发去了长岛</i>
<i>So, they headed out to Long Island,</i>

15
00:00:28,230 --> 00:00:30,220
<i>当他们一推开那扇门...</i>
<i>and when they walked in the door...</i>

16
00:00:31,210 --> 00:00:32,520
我们买了
We'll take it!

17
00:00:33,060 --> 00:00:34,340
我们不能买
We-We can't take it.

18
00:00:34,340 --> 00:00:36,090
我们就是卖方
We're the ones selling it.

19
00:00:36,450 --> 00:00:38,330
我们是要卖房 对吧
We are selling it, right?

20
00:00:38,400 --> 00:00:40,790
宝贝  你的祖父母把这房子彻底交给你了
Baby, your grandparents gave you this house outright.

21
00:00:40,790 --> 00:00:42,490
在我看来  我们有五个选择
So, the way I see it, we have five options.

22
00:00:42,490 --> 00:00:43,750
第一  卖掉它
1, sell it.

23
00:00:43,750 --> 00:00:45,970
第二  空着它  变鬼屋
2, year-round haunted house.

24
00:00:45,970 --> 00:00:50,280
第三  在周围竖起大栅栏  建个猩猩保护区
3, giant fence around the perimeter, chimp sanctuary.

25
00:00:50,280 --> 00:00:51,770
反正后院已经有轮胎秋千了
There's already a tire swing in the backyard.

26
00:00:51,770 --> 00:00:54,160
第四  用锤子凿了它
4, we destroy it with sledgehammers.

27
00:00:54,160 --> 00:00:55,450
我喜欢第四个
I like four.

28
00:00:55,620 --> 00:00:58,780
第五  我们搬进来  抚养孩子长大
5, we move in, raise our children

29
00:00:58,780 --> 00:01:01,010
把这里变成我们的家
and make this our family home.

30
00:01:01,230 --> 00:01:02,750
直到他们毕业
Till they graduate.

31
00:01:03,340 --> 00:01:05,500
然后我们再用锤子凿了它
Then we destroy it with sledgehammers.

32
00:01:06,270 --> 00:01:07,790
全家齐上阵
As a family.

33
00:01:09,020 --> 00:01:10,610
不  不能这么想
No, this is crazy!

34
00:01:10,610 --> 00:01:12,020
我们可是纽约人
We are New York people.

35
00:01:12,020 --> 00:01:14,920
我们有心爱的公寓  它又大又漂亮
We have a big, beautiful apartment that we love.

36
00:01:15,080 --> 00:01:15,890
你说得对
You're right.

37
00:01:15,890 --> 00:01:18,650
<i>但那天  马修和莉莉发生了点状况</i>
<i>But something happened to Lily and Marshall that day.</i>

38
00:01:18,650 --> 00:01:20,360
<i>所有从外地返回纽约家中的</i>
<i>Something that happens to all New Yorkers</i>

39
00:01:20,360 --> 00:01:23,390
<i>纽约人都会遇到这种状况</i>
<i>who return home from anywhere other than New York.</i>

40
00:01:24,400 --> 00:01:26,270
<i>他们又大又温馨的公寓</i>
<i>Their big, lovely apartment...</i>

41
00:01:26,270 --> 00:01:28,330
哟  真是奇了怪了
Huh. That's weird.

42
00:01:29,290 --> 00:01:30,730
<i>瞬间缩水</i>
<i>...shrank.</i>

43
00:01:41,750 --> 00:01:44,540
好吧  感恩节一过  我就节食
Okay, after Thanksgiving, I'm cutting out carbs.

老爸老妈浪漫史
第七季  第十一集

49
00:02:01,770 --> 00:02:04,790
<i>孩子们  在过去的几周  巴尼过得很不易</i>
<i>Now, kids, it had been a rough couple weeks for Barney.</i>

50
00:02:04,790 --> 00:02:07,050
<i>他先是背着女友  跟罗宾偷情</i>
<i>First, he cheated on his girlfriend with Robin,</i>

51
00:02:07,300 --> 00:02:09,620
<i>接着为了罗宾  跟女友分手</i>
<i>then he broke up with his girlfriend for Robin,</i>

52
00:02:09,620 --> 00:02:11,700
<i>最后罗宾选择了凯文  放弃了他</i>
<i>then Robin chose Kevin over him.</i>

53
00:02:11,810 --> 00:02:13,810
<i>所以他有点萎靡不振</i>
<i>So he was kind of in a bad place.</i>

54
00:02:14,900 --> 00:02:16,100
你还好吧
You all right?

55
00:02:16,110 --> 00:02:17,270
为什么会不好
Why wouldn't I be all right?

56
00:02:17,270 --> 00:02:18,430
巴尼恢复单身啦
Barney's single again!

57
00:02:18,430 --> 00:02:20,390
美国总算盼到这一天了
It's what America's been clamoring for.

58
00:02:20,400 --> 00:02:22,110
你刚刚结束一段恋情
You just went through a break-up.

59
00:02:22,350 --> 00:02:24,080
人们通常会在这时候做傻事
That's usually when people do something crazy.

60
00:02:24,080 --> 00:02:25,420
如果是个女孩  她就会减掉刘海
If you were a girl, you'd have cut bangs

61
00:02:25,420 --> 00:02:26,830
然后跟你这样的人约会
and be dating you by now.

62
00:02:27,560 --> 00:02:29,520
向我保证  你不会去做傻事
Just promise me you won't do something crazy.

63
00:02:29,520 --> 00:02:31,580
我保证不会做傻事
I promise I won't do something crazy.

64
00:02:31,940 --> 00:02:34,100
<i>别担心  他很快就会做傻事</i>
<i>Don't worry, he's gonna do something crazy.</i>

65
00:02:34,530 --> 00:02:37,090
其实  我觉得我受够女人了
In fact, I think I'm done with girls.

66
00:02:37,280 --> 00:02:38,670
我甚至不确定是否还喜欢她们
I'm not sure I even like them anymore.

67
00:02:38,670 --> 00:02:40,400
鉴于你多年来对她们的所作所为
Based on all the stuff you've done to them over the years,

68
00:02:40,400 --> 00:02:42,180
我不确定你是否喜欢过她们
I'm not sure you ever liked them.

69
00:02:42,310 --> 00:02:43,550
我是说真的
I'm serious.

70
00:02:43,550 --> 00:02:45,250
拜托  你爱死女人了
Come on, you love girls.

71
00:02:45,250 --> 00:02:46,850
如果真要说谁受够女人了  那也应该是我
If anyone should be done with girls, it's me.

72
00:02:46,850 --> 00:02:48,100
瞧瞧我这一年过得
Look at the year I've had.

73
00:02:48,100 --> 00:02:50,540
苏伊  维多利亚  淫荡南瓜妹
Zoey, Victoria, the Slutty Pumpkin.

74
00:02:50,550 --> 00:02:52,640
现在换我担心你会做傻事了
Now I'm worried you're gonna do something crazy.

75
00:02:52,640 --> 00:02:54,720
我可不会做傻事
I'm not gonna do something crazy.

76
00:02:54,870 --> 00:02:57,420
<i>没错  我也离做傻事不远了</i>
<i>And yes, I'm gonna do someththg crazy, too.</i>

77
00:02:58,820 --> 00:03:00,440
但是女人啊
But girls, man.

78
00:03:00,760 --> 00:03:01,970
女人啊
Girls.

79
00:03:01,970 --> 00:03:04,500
-你知道最绝的一招是什么吗  -变成同志
- You know what would kick ass? - Being gay?

80
00:03:04,500 --> 00:03:06,800
变成同志最牛逼了
Being gay would kick ass!

81
00:03:06,800 --> 00:03:08,550
同意  男人之间互相理解
Word. Guys understand each other.

82
00:03:08,550 --> 00:03:10,390
想象有这么一段关系
Imagine a relationship where,

83
00:03:10,390 --> 00:03:12,320
不必每时每刻表达爱意
instead of talking about feelings all the time,

84
00:03:12,330 --> 00:03:14,680
俩人一起只是打电动吃披萨
you just play some Madden, eat a pizza,

85
00:03:14,690 --> 00:03:16,510
一起嗑药  一起嗨
give each other a happy, roll over

86
00:03:16,510 --> 00:03:18,240
更不用抱着一起睡
and have some cuddle-free shut-eye.

87
00:03:18,240 --> 00:03:19,640
哥们儿  不管怎样我要说
Bro, for what it's worth,

88
00:03:19,800 --> 00:03:22,870
如果我们都是同志  你会是我的首选伴侣
if we were both gay, you'd be my first call.

89
00:03:22,970 --> 00:03:25,020
那你介意打给马修  告诉他这话吗
Would you mind calling Marshall and telling him that?

90
00:03:25,020 --> 00:03:26,160
因为他一直以为...
'Cause he thinks...

91
00:03:26,160 --> 00:03:27,490
不行  我只是说假如
No, this is only in a scenario

92
00:03:27,490 --> 00:03:29,590
你和我是同志  与马修无关
where just you and I are gay, not Marshall.

93
00:03:29,590 --> 00:03:31,010
但如果我们三个都是同志
But if all three of us were gay,

94
00:03:31,010 --> 00:03:33,010
你还是会选我  而不是马修  对吧
you'd pick me over Marshall, right?

95
00:03:33,390 --> 00:03:34,760
如果我们三个都是同志
If all three of us were gay?

96
00:03:34,970 --> 00:03:38,700
姐妹  我们仨一定会爽翻天的
Girlfriend, we would all three of us have some fun.

97
00:03:38,700 --> 00:03:40,720
我们绝对会的
Damn right we would.

98
00:03:43,860 --> 00:03:44,920
我们不是同志
We're not gay.

99
00:03:44,920 --> 00:03:47,560
没错  女人才是我的菜
Nope. Stuck with girls.

100
00:03:47,780 --> 00:03:49,080
我真希望男人可以
I wish men could have children

101
00:03:49,080 --> 00:03:51,580
自己生孩子  就像海马一样
on their own, like sea horses.

102
00:03:51,580 --> 00:03:52,740
你这话不会是我以为的那种意思吧
Are you saying what I think you're saying?

103
00:03:52,740 --> 00:03:53,650
他们育儿袋太小了
They have a little pouch.

104
00:03:53,660 --> 00:03:55,340
它们该叫海袋鼠
They should be called sea kangaroos.

105
00:03:55,340 --> 00:03:57,970
不对  你想要孩子吗
No, y-you want kids?

106
00:03:58,360 --> 00:04:01,310
或许我最近是开始有点考虑
Maybe I've kind of lately been thinking

107
00:04:01,310 --> 00:04:04,440
娶妻生子之类的事
about the whole wife and kids thing.

108
00:04:04,640 --> 00:04:06,600
只是娶妻这一环省了
Just minus the wife.

109
00:04:06,600 --> 00:04:08,190
男人也可以把孩子拉扯大
You could always go it alone.

110
00:04:08,190 --> 00:04:10,390
就像《细路仔》里的杜蒙德先生
Like Mr. Drummond on Diff'rent Strokes.

111
00:04:08,190 --> 00:04:10,390
{\an8}美国80年代电视剧  杜蒙德一人抚养三个孩子

112
00:04:10,490 --> 00:04:12,250
是啊  可那是在80年代
Yeah, but that was the '80s,

113
00:04:12,260 --> 00:04:15,210
那时你还能坐着豪车  随便路过城里任一球场
when you could just swing by any inner-city playground in your limo

114
00:04:15,210 --> 00:04:16,590
接俩孩子回家养呢
and scoop up some kids.

115
00:04:16,590 --> 00:04:18,090
更方便快捷
Simpler times.

116
00:04:18,330 --> 00:04:20,710
我想抚养孩子这种事  还是得个帮手好
I guess it's better to have someone in it with you anyway, you know?

117
00:04:20,710 --> 00:04:21,610
比如终身伴侣
Lifetime partnership.

118
00:04:21,610 --> 00:04:23,440
我生命中唯一
The only partnership in my life

119
00:04:23,440 --> 00:04:25,390
经得起时间考验的伴侣关系就是
that has stood the test of time is this one.

120
00:04:25,390 --> 00:04:28,650
神圣的兄弟情谊
The sacred bond of man and bro.

121
00:04:28,900 --> 00:04:30,880
或许我们该一起组建家庭
Maybe we should start a family together.

122
00:04:35,460 --> 00:04:36,310
开什么玩笑
Are you kidding?

123
00:04:36,310 --> 00:04:38,310
这地方大得很
This place is huge.

124
00:04:38,310 --> 00:04:41,060
瞧  我还能大摇大摆地跳舞呢
I mean, look, I can dance all crazy in here.

125
00:04:41,060 --> 00:04:42,380
靠...
Oh! Sh...

126
00:04:44,170 --> 00:04:45,840
听着  罗宾
Listen, um, Robin,

127
00:04:45,870 --> 00:04:49,200
你同意今年感恩节都在东梅多过吗
are you okay with us all doing Thanksgiving out in East Meadow?

128
00:04:45,870 --> 00:04:49,200
{\an8}东梅多是长岛的一个村庄

129
00:04:49,200 --> 00:04:50,920
好呀  应该会好玩吧
Uh, yeah, I guess that'd be nice.

130
00:04:50,920 --> 00:04:51,970
太好了
Oh, great!

131
00:04:51,970 --> 00:04:54,320
我和莉莉打算感恩节过后
And then after Thanksgiving, Lily and I were thinking

132
00:04:54,320 --> 00:04:56,070
在那房子住一段时间
that we would just stay at the house

133
00:04:56,200 --> 00:04:58,260
住到...
until, you know...

134
00:04:58,960 --> 00:05:00,290
终老
we die.

135
00:05:00,300 --> 00:05:01,500
什么
What?

136
00:05:01,520 --> 00:05:02,760
不行
No!

137
00:05:03,140 --> 00:05:05,280
你们不能搬去长岛
You can't move to Long Island!

138
00:05:05,280 --> 00:05:07,440
可房子那么漂亮
But this house is so nice.

139
00:05:07,440 --> 00:05:09,140
宽敞又整洁
It's big, and it's clean,

140
00:05:09,140 --> 00:05:11,240
如果有蟑螂
and if there's cockroaches,

141
00:05:11,240 --> 00:05:13,820
看到我们也会谦虚低头绕路走
they respect us enough to sneak around.

142
00:05:13,850 --> 00:05:14,810
瞧瞧你说那话儿
Listen to yourself.

143
00:05:14,810 --> 00:05:17,330
这全是孕期犯傻症在作祟
This is Pregnancy Brain all over again.

144
00:05:17,330 --> 00:05:19,410
不  我的犯傻期已经过了
No, I'm done with Pregnancy Brain.

145
00:05:19,410 --> 00:05:22,920
现在是奇幻春梦期
I've moved on to weird pregnancy sex dreams.

146
00:05:19,410 --> 00:05:22,920
{\an8}孕期妇女会在孕中期性欲大增  而且睡觉时容易做梦

147
00:05:23,410 --> 00:05:25,020
长官好
Officer.

148
00:05:25,570 --> 00:05:28,170
你懂的  你懂的
You know. You know.

149
00:05:28,520 --> 00:05:31,510
我只是说  你们现在脑子不清楚
I'm-I'm just saying, you're not in the right mind

150
00:05:31,520 --> 00:05:33,810
不适宜做重大决定
to be making this decision right now.

151
00:05:33,810 --> 00:05:35,250
罗宾说得对
You know what? Robin's right.

152
00:05:35,250 --> 00:05:38,170
我们现在的状态的确不适宜做重大决定
We are in no state of mind to make this kind of decision.

153
00:05:38,170 --> 00:05:40,890
谢谢  世界终于恢复正常了
Thank you. And now you're stepping off the crazy bus.

154
00:05:40,890 --> 00:05:42,400
我们让老天爷做主吧
We let the universe decide.

155
00:05:42,400 --> 00:05:44,020
世界又开始疯狂了
And now you're back on board.

156
00:05:44,020 --> 00:05:45,550
听到了吗  老天爷
You hear that, Universe?

157
00:05:46,020 --> 00:05:48,470
如果你在接下来的24小时内
If you send us a sign in the next...

158
00:05:48,520 --> 00:05:50,360
给我们指示
24 hours,

159
00:05:50,360 --> 00:05:53,060
我们就搬去长岛  说好咯
then we're moving to Long Island! Okay?

160
00:05:54,140 --> 00:05:54,950
计时开始
Go.

161
00:05:54,950 --> 00:05:55,860
伙计们
Hey, guys,

162
00:05:55,860 --> 00:05:57,580
我再说最后一次  这地方大得很
for the last time, this place is enormous--

163
00:05:58,770 --> 00:06:01,070
烦死了  你们家到底有多少盏灯啊
Geez, how many lamps do you have?

164
00:06:01,940 --> 00:06:03,090
这想法太妙了
It's genius!

165
00:06:03,090 --> 00:06:05,890
与其将人生浪费在某个女人身上
Instead of throwing away your life marrying some girl,

166
00:06:05,890 --> 00:06:08,570
还不如和你的铁哥们儿一起养个孩子呢
you just go splitsies on a kid with your best bro!

167
00:06:08,570 --> 00:06:10,010
我不必纠结于选择
I wouldn't have to choose

168
00:06:10,010 --> 00:06:11,920
约会还是成家
between dating and having a family.

169
00:06:11,920 --> 00:06:14,400
因为我可以带孩子去约会
Hell, I could bring the kids on dates!

170
00:06:14,400 --> 00:06:15,650
家庭破碎
And a broken home?

171
00:06:15,650 --> 00:06:16,890
那是什么
Um, what's that?

172
00:06:16,890 --> 00:06:18,190
我们的孩子绝不会知道
Our kids will never know,

173
00:06:18,200 --> 00:06:19,660
因为我们永远不会分开
'cause we're never gonna split up!

174
00:06:19,660 --> 00:06:20,620
为什么要分开
Why would we?

175
00:06:20,620 --> 00:06:22,300
当然  如果被孩子她妈撞见
I mean, sure, when your wife walks in

176
00:06:22,300 --> 00:06:24,240
你和火辣空姐的好事  她铁定跟你离婚
on you banging a hot flight attendant, you get a divorce.

177
00:06:24,240 --> 00:06:26,000
但如果是被孩子他爹撞见了
But when your bro-parent walks in on you

178
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:27,150
结果就太不同啦
banging a hot flight attendant...

179
00:06:27,150 --> 00:06:29,810
应该为这种家庭击掌欢呼
You get five of these bad boys, right up high!

180
00:06:30,410 --> 00:06:32,440
毫不犹豫加入同欢  对吧
And you totally join in, right?!

181
00:06:33,110 --> 00:06:34,590
-不行  这是底线  -这是底线
- Oh, no, there's the line. - That's the line.

182
00:06:34,590 --> 00:06:36,500
我们要有分寸  还好我们知道底线在哪儿
We found the line. It's good we know where it is.

183
00:06:36,500 --> 00:06:37,190
伙计们
Hey, guys.

184
00:06:39,530 --> 00:06:40,990
我们有事宣布
We have an announcement.

185
00:06:41,190 --> 00:06:42,790
所以你们的意思是
So what you're saying is,

186
00:06:42,790 --> 00:06:44,810
如果你们注定要搬去长岛
if you're meant to move to Long Island,

187
00:06:44,810 --> 00:06:46,280
那么上天的指示
some sign from the universe

188
00:06:46,280 --> 00:06:47,830
就会奇迹般地出现在你家门前吗
will magically appear at your doorstep?

189
00:06:47,830 --> 00:06:48,630
<i>孩子们</i>
<i>Now, kids, </i>

190
00:06:48,630 --> 00:06:51,140
<i>罗宾话音刚落那一刻  其实没人敲门</i>
<i>I don't think there was a knock on the door at that exact moment,</i>

191
00:06:51,140 --> 00:06:53,630
</i>但为了凸显故事效果...</i>
</i>but for the purposes of this story...</i>

192
00:06:56,320 --> 00:06:57,630
你好  我是克莱夫
Hi, I'm Clive.

193
00:06:57,630 --> 00:06:58,870
我就住在你们楼上
I live upstairs from you.

194
00:06:58,870 --> 00:07:00,630
这是你们的牌子吗["牌子"与"指示"同音]
Is this your sign?

195
00:06:58,870 --> 00:07:00,630
{\an8}房屋待售

196
00:07:01,490 --> 00:07:03,530
我不清楚  克莱夫
I don't know, Clive.

197
00:07:04,480 --> 00:07:05,350
是吗
Is it?

198
00:07:05,350 --> 00:07:07,290
我们把这牌子忘外面了吗
Oh, did we leave that outside?

199
00:07:07,300 --> 00:07:09,940
对  我们准备卖掉我们在长岛的房子
Yeah, we're selling our house in Long Island.

200
00:07:09,940 --> 00:07:12,240
可惜你们卖的不是这里
Oh. Too bad you're not selling this place.

201
00:07:12,240 --> 00:07:13,930
我想把我家改造成复式公寓呢
I'd love to turn mine into a duplex.

202
00:07:13,930 --> 00:07:15,770
而且我愿意出高价
And I'd give you a really good price for it,

203
00:07:15,770 --> 00:07:18,070
因为我富得流油
because I am so rich.

204
00:07:19,360 --> 00:07:20,870
这句他可没说
He did not say that.

205
00:07:20,870 --> 00:07:22,080
看鞋子就知道了
His shoes did.

206
00:07:22,090 --> 00:07:25,170
好吧  重点是我们收到上天的指示了
Okay, the point is, we got the sign.

207
00:07:25,250 --> 00:07:27,250
我们要搬去东梅多咯
We're moving to East Meadow.

208
00:07:27,250 --> 00:07:28,470
咱们去拿点香槟吧
Let's get some champagne.

209
00:07:28,470 --> 00:07:30,370
<i>就这样  莉莉和马修<i>

211
00:07:32,630 --> 00:07:34,570
<i>这让我们别无选择  唯有...<i>
<i>Which meant only one thing for us...<i>

212
00:07:34,700 --> 00:07:36,280
抱个孩子回家养吧
We're having a baby!

213
00:07:36,280 --> 00:07:38,540
"一个孩子两个爹"计划启动

214
00:07:43,090 --> 00:07:44,960
-我们讨论一下孩子的名字吧  -巴尼
- Hey, let's talk baby names! - Barney...

215
00:07:44,960 --> 00:07:46,790
天啊  这名字也是我的首选
Oh, my God! That was my first choice, too.

216
00:07:46,790 --> 00:07:50,200
不  听着  咱俩都喝醉了
No, listen. You and I are drunk.

217
00:07:50,200 --> 00:07:54,110
所以说  就算真有机会收养孩子
Which means there's a chance that adopting a baby--

218
00:07:54,380 --> 00:07:56,130
不管我现在把他想得多可爱
no matter how cute he is in my head

219
00:07:56,130 --> 00:07:59,220
穿着小牛仔装  像骑马一样
with his little cowboy outfit on and he's riding our dog

220
00:07:59,220 --> 00:08:01,800
骑着我们的狗  对  还要养条狗
like a horse and we also have a dog,

纯种金毛  孩子骑着安全  因为这狗会救人 
purebred Golden, but it's okay, she's a rescue--

222
00:08:01,800 --> 00:08:04,650
{\an8}金毛常被训练为救援犬

223
00:08:04,770 --> 00:08:06,670
这可能不是个好主意
might not be a good idea.

224
00:08:06,780 --> 00:08:07,860
没错
You're right.

225
00:08:08,460 --> 00:08:11,430
那我们就各自回家  吃片阿司匹林
So let's go home, take some aspirin,

226
00:08:11,430 --> 00:08:13,570
多喝点水[醒酒]
drink lots of water,

227
00:08:13,570 --> 00:08:17,130
看看明天  是否还觉得这是个好主意
and then see if it's still a good idea tomorrow.

228
00:08:17,510 --> 00:08:18,490
仍然是一个好主意
It's still a good idea!

229
00:08:18,490 --> 00:08:20,400
绝对是个好主意
It's totally still a good idea!

罗宾  我们很感激你的大力挽留
Look, Robin, we appreciate that you want us to stay in the city,

241

297
00:10:53,460 --> 00:10:55,620
那马修有变成捉鬼敢死队的队员吗
And did Marshall become a Ghostbuster?

298
00:10:55,620 --> 00:10:57,710
消防站那房子至今没卖出去
That firehouse is still for sale.

299
00:10:57,710 --> 00:11:00,360
连欧尼·哈德逊都求你不要加入
Even Ernie Hudson begged you not to go through with that.

300
00:11:00,360 --> 00:11:01,860
欧尼·哈德逊是个懦夫
Ernie Hudson is a coward!

301
00:11:03,600 --> 00:11:04,700
我当然要继续工作啦
Of course I'm gonna keep my job.

302
00:11:04,700 --> 00:11:06,070
我为什么要辞职
Why wouldn't I keep my job?

303
00:11:06,070 --> 00:11:09,750
我的意思是  建筑对你来说...
Well, I mean, this whole architecture thing...

304
00:11:09,750 --> 00:11:11,770
爱好多过工作吧
isn't it more of a hobby?

305
00:11:11,770 --> 00:11:12,870
什么
Excuse me?

306
00:11:12,870 --> 00:11:14,520
好  开始吵架了  算了
And now we're fighting. You know what?

307
00:11:14,520 --> 00:11:15,660
忘记我刚说的话
Forget I said anything.

308
00:11:15,660 --> 00:11:18,780
不不不  我们还没讨论完呢
No! No, no, no. We're having this discussion.

309
00:11:18,800 --> 00:11:20,670
建筑是我终生的事业
Architecture is my life's work.

310
00:11:20,670 --> 00:11:21,830
你为什么不辞职呢
Why don't you quit your job?

311
00:11:21,830 --> 00:11:23,900
我都不知道你靠什么谋生
I don't even know what it is you do for a living.

312
00:11:24,060 --> 00:11:26,110
"我靠什么谋生"
"What it is I do for a living?"

313
00:11:26,110 --> 00:11:29,250
当然是工作了  泰德
I work, Ted, 14 hours a day

314
00:11:29,250 --> 00:11:31,580
当你坐在那儿信手涂鸦时
so that our baby can have food

315
00:11:31,580 --> 00:11:33,430
老子一天上十四个小时班
and clothes and a nice house,

316
00:11:33,430 --> 00:11:36,790
我们的孩子才有得吃  有得穿  有得住
while you sit around doodling pictures of buildings.

317
00:11:36,790 --> 00:11:38,140
这就是我谋生的方法
That's "What it is I do."

318
00:11:38,140 --> 00:11:40,110
我现在不想讨论了  老子要去酒吧
You know what? Screw this. I'm gonna go to the bar.

319
00:11:40,120 --> 00:11:41,620
去吧  去吧  你以为灌醉自己
Yeah, right, right, 'cause the answer's always

320
00:11:41,620 --> 00:11:43,220
就能解决问题吗
at the bottom of a bottle!

321
00:11:43,690 --> 00:11:45,680
等等  站住
Wait, wait, wait! Hold it!

322
00:11:45,780 --> 00:11:48,160
多动脑子勿动气  快动脑
Brainstorm. Brainstorm.

323
00:11:48,760 --> 00:11:50,410
谁都不用辞职
Nobody quits their job.

324
00:11:51,670 --> 00:11:52,680
我们找一个保姆
We get a nanny.

325
00:11:52,690 --> 00:11:53,640
保姆归我
Dibs on the nanny.

326
00:11:53,640 --> 00:11:55,190
不  不准勾搭保姆
No. No banging the nanny.

327
00:11:55,190 --> 00:11:56,960
泰德  请不要现在就开始制定
Ted, please don not dig in on this whole

328
00:11:56,960 --> 00:11:58,560
"不准上保姆"这种硬性规定
no-banging-the-nanny policy.

329
00:11:58,560 --> 00:11:59,850
好吧  那我们找两个保姆
Okay, fine. We'll get two nannies.

330
00:11:59,860 --> 00:12:02,180
一个用来滚床单  一个用来看孩子
One for banging, one for childcare.

331
00:12:02,180 --> 00:12:04,290
兼滚床单  俩保姆都归我
Slash banging. Dibs on both nannies!

332
00:12:04,310 --> 00:12:06,740
想象一下  泰德  你和我
Just think of it, Ted, you and me,

333
00:12:06,740 --> 00:12:08,590
一起生活  有个孩子
living together, with our kid,

334
00:12:08,590 --> 00:12:11,490
-两个热辣的保姆  一条宠物眼镜蛇   -什么
- my two hot nannies, our pet cobra... - What?

335
00:12:11,490 --> 00:12:13,240
孩子需要一只宠物眼镜蛇  泰德
A kid needs a pet cobra, Ted.

336
00:12:13,240 --> 00:12:14,180
少啰嗦
Don't be a pill about this.

337
00:12:14,180 --> 00:12:16,460
欢乐派对连连开  个个开足一整周
And we'll have amazing weeklong parties,

338
00:12:16,460 --> 00:12:19,490
满屋子都是刀剑和忍者飞镖
and there'll be swords and ninja stars lying around.

339
00:12:19,490 --> 00:12:20,960
<i>那一刻我终于明白</i>
<i>That's when I realized:</i>

340
00:12:20,980 --> 00:12:23,820
<i>和朋友一起领养个孩子  是疯狂</i>
<i>adopting a baby with a friend? Crazy.</i>

341
00:12:24,130 --> 00:12:27,720
<i>和巴尼一起领养个孩子  是真他妈疯狂</i>
<i>Adopting a baby with Barney? Freaking nuts.</i>

342
00:12:28,130 --> 00:12:30,000
我不能和你一起领养孩子  巴尼
I can't adopt a baby with you, Barney.

343
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:30,740
为什么不能
Why not?

344
00:12:30,740 --> 00:12:32,200
因为孩子还没领进家
Because we don't even have one yet

345
00:12:32,200 --> 00:12:34,040
你就表现得像个差劲的父亲
and you're already a terrible father.

346
00:12:34,150 --> 00:12:36,190
我懂了
Oh, I get it.

347
00:12:36,980 --> 00:12:38,210
你肯定是想上保姆
You want one of the nannies.

348
00:12:38,210 --> 00:12:40,230
门儿都没有  两个都是我的
Well, you can't have 'em! They're mine!

349
00:12:40,230 --> 00:12:42,740
所以麻烦你另请一个保姆吧
So you're just gonna have to get yourself a third nanny.

350
00:12:43,070 --> 00:12:45,180
对了  第三个也归我  祝您愉快
Except dibs on the third nanny! Good day!

351
00:12:47,330 --> 00:12:48,950
<i>话说感恩节将近</i>
<i>Which brings us to Thanksgiving.</i>

352
00:12:49,290 --> 00:12:50,930
<i>马修  莉莉和罗宾出发</i>
<i>Marshall, Lily and Robin were heading out</i>

353
00:12:50,930 --> 00:12:52,950
<i>去长岛做准备</i>
<i>to Long Island early to get ready.</i>

354
00:13:00,670 --> 00:13:02,570
好吧  这怎么可能出得去
Okay, how is this even possible?!

355
00:13:03,150 --> 00:13:05,010
这就跟生孩子一样 费死劲儿了
'Cause how did we even get it in here?!

356
00:13:07,360 --> 00:13:10,200
看到你这个大孩子  我坚决要换成无痛分娩
Okay, I change my mind. I want an epidural.

357
00:13:10,650 --> 00:13:12,290
你们都疯了吧
You guys are crazy.

358
00:13:12,290 --> 00:13:14,790
这个地方大得很
This place is enormous.

359
00:13:14,790 --> 00:13:16,340
环顾四周
I mean, look arou...

360
00:13:16,340 --> 00:13:19,600
你他妈的没听过有个东西叫吊灯啊
Have you never heard of overhead lighting?!

361
00:13:23,550 --> 00:13:24,710
你说的没错
You're right.

362
00:13:24,710 --> 00:13:25,790
我懂了
I get it.

363
00:13:26,300 --> 00:13:27,600
这个地方太棒了
This place is great.

364
00:13:29,250 --> 00:13:31,750
问一下  洗手间在哪里
Um, excuse me. Where is the restroom?

365
00:13:31,750 --> 00:13:34,320
-就在那  -太好了
- Oh. Right there. - Oh, good, great.

366
00:13:34,480 --> 00:13:36,070
我要进去
I'm just gonna go in there and...

367
00:13:36,070 --> 00:13:39,350
除非你俩答应我不搬家  否则我就他妈的不出来
not come out until you promise never to move away!

368
00:13:41,860 --> 00:13:43,530
还好我们有三个洗手间
It's a good thing we have three bathrooms.

369
00:13:45,220 --> 00:13:46,040
巴尼
Hey, Barney.

370
00:13:46,040 --> 00:13:48,290
那天我说你是个糟糕的父亲
Uh, listen, sorry about the other day

371
00:13:48,460 --> 00:13:50,300
我对此深感抱歉
when I said you'd be a terrible father.

372
00:13:50,340 --> 00:13:51,750
你这么想很正常
You had no reason to think otherwise.

373
00:13:51,750 --> 00:13:53,750
完全可以理解  我没生气
Totally understandable. I'm not mad.

374
00:13:54,420 --> 00:13:56,140
谢谢  说实话
Thanks. And, uh, let's be honest,

375
00:13:56,140 --> 00:13:57,440
那天我们都有点疯狂
we were both acting a little crazy.

376
00:13:57,440 --> 00:14:00,600
我觉得我们俩都没准备好承担责任...
I don't think either of us is truly ready for the responsibility of...

377
00:14:01,650 --> 00:14:02,900
爸爸回来咯
Daddy's home.

378
00:14:09,870 --> 00:14:13,440
巴尼  这宝宝从哪儿弄来的
Uh, Barney, uh, where did you get this baby?

379
00:14:13,450 --> 00:14:14,520
拜托
Please.

380
00:14:14,620 --> 00:14:15,810
是你领养的吗
Did you adopt it?

381
00:14:15,940 --> 00:14:17,090
拜托
Please.

382
00:14:17,630 --> 00:14:19,200
你有个能帮你弄到小孩的人吗
Do you have a baby guy?

383
00:14:19,510 --> 00:14:22,360
是不是找"专员"这个专员  帮你找了个能弄到小孩的人
Did Guy the guy guy get you a baby guy?

384
00:14:22,570 --> 00:14:23,920
泰德  我们得走了
Ted, we should get going.

385
00:14:23,990 --> 00:14:26,230
不不不  我哪都不跟你去
No, no, no. I'm not going anywhere with you.

386
00:14:26,230 --> 00:14:26,810
从目前情况看
For all I know,

387
00:14:26,810 --> 00:14:29,040
我很有可能在协助及唆使绑架
I could be aiding and abetting a kidnapping.

388
00:14:29,040 --> 00:14:30,920
爸比没有在生气
Sh...bro-ddy's not mad.

389
00:14:30,920 --> 00:14:32,870
他只是讲话有点点大声
He's just being a wittle loud.

390
00:14:32,870 --> 00:14:35,170
他可耐你了  真的哦
He wuvs you! Yes, he does!

391
00:14:35,170 --> 00:14:37,470
-疯了疯了  -我们在外面等你
- This is insane! - We'll be waiting outside.

392
00:14:37,470 --> 00:14:39,440
-快点  -不行  我做不到
- Come on. - No, I can't.

393
00:14:39,520 --> 00:14:40,730
听不到听不到
Yeah. Na-na-na.

394
00:14:41,560 --> 00:14:43,860
<i>但我们还是出门了</i>
<i>But then we went outside.</i>

395
00:14:44,370 --> 00:14:45,900
我的天
Oh, my goodness.

396
00:14:45,900 --> 00:14:48,330
-好漂亮的宝宝哦  -谢谢
- What a beautiful baby. - Thank you.

397
00:14:48,340 --> 00:14:50,000
顺便说一下  我和我朋友不是一对
By the way, my friend and I, we're not a couple.

398
00:14:50,000 --> 00:14:52,410
我们只是共同抚养孩子的
We are two straight guys who are single

399
00:14:52,410 --> 00:14:54,070
两个单身直男  别误会哦
and we have a baby. Just so you know.

400
00:14:54,070 --> 00:14:56,250
好可爱的小姑娘哦
Look at this sweet girl.

401
00:14:56,250 --> 00:14:57,870
我刚刚跟这个女生说过
Hi. I was just telling this first girl,

402
00:14:57,870 --> 00:14:59,520
我和我朋友  都是直男
my friend and I, both straight,

403
00:14:59,520 --> 00:15:01,800
都是单身  小孩也有了
both available, and we have a baby.

404
00:15:01,860 --> 00:15:03,680
这个小天使是谁呀
Oh, who is this little angel?

405
00:15:03,680 --> 00:15:05,080
好吧  再简单说遍  我和他
Okay, real quick: me and him,

406
00:15:05,080 --> 00:15:06,160
直男  单身  有小孩
not gay, single, have a baby.

407
00:15:06,160 --> 00:15:07,700
我们应该做个告示牌
We should look into having a sign made.

408
00:15:08,180 --> 00:15:10,560
<i>孩子们  再次强调  当时日子真心艰难呀</i>
<i>Kids, again, we were going through a difficult time.</i>

409
00:15:10,560 --> 00:15:12,240
<i>不过这部分还是挺开心的</i>
<i>But this part was kind of fun.</i>

410
00:15:12,640 --> 00:15:15,280
好可爱哦
Aw...! So cute!

411
00:15:16,780 --> 00:15:18,430
妙  太妙了
This is awesome.

412
00:15:18,430 --> 00:15:19,620
对不对
Right?

413
00:15:20,960 --> 00:15:22,620
罗宾  出来咱们谈谈吧
Robin, come out and talk to us.

414
00:15:22,620 --> 00:15:24,310
除非这世界停止疯狂
I'm not coming out of this bathroom

415
00:15:24,310 --> 00:15:26,720
否则我就他妈的不出来
until everyone stops acting crazy!

416
00:15:26,820 --> 00:15:28,830
这世界很正常
No one is being crazy.

417
00:15:28,860 --> 00:15:30,900
<i>再次强调  我是为了凸显故事效果...</i>
<i>Again, for the purposes of this story...</i>

418
00:15:31,940 --> 00:15:35,710
泰德和我有小孩了  很疯狂吧
Ted and I have a baby. Crazy!

419
00:15:35,900 --> 00:15:37,040
到底怎么回事
What the hell is that?

420
00:15:37,040 --> 00:15:40,700
各位  她叫小旋风·史丁森·莫斯比
Guys, this is Hurricane Stinson-Mosby.

421
00:15:40,700 --> 00:15:41,620
是莫斯比·史丁森
Mosby-Stinson.

422
00:15:41,620 --> 00:15:44,000
你为孩子取名叫"小旋风"
You named your baby Hurricane?

423
00:15:44,000 --> 00:15:45,280
真是
That is...

424
00:15:45,830 --> 00:15:48,860
太不为宝宝的未来考虑了
ultimately inconsiderate to the child

425
00:15:48,860 --> 00:15:50,370
这名字可要跟着她一辈子呀
who has to live with that name.

426
00:15:50,980 --> 00:15:53,080
巴尼怎么把小孩弄到手的
Okay, how the hell does Barney have a baby?

427
00:15:53,080 --> 00:15:54,430
不知道  完全没头绪
No idea. Super confused.

428
00:15:54,430 --> 00:15:56,490
我觉得最好别深究
I'm finding it best to just sort of go with it.

429
00:15:56,710 --> 00:15:58,860
她超级可爱的  对吧
She's super cute, though, right?

430
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:00,880
等下
Wait a minute.

431
00:16:00,880 --> 00:16:05,010
哎呀呀  小旋风把粑粑拉里面了
Oh, guh! Hurricane dookied in her drawers.

432
00:16:05,010 --> 00:16:08,270
哈哈  拉裤裤了
Ha-ha! Poopy pants!

433
00:16:08,920 --> 00:16:10,580
她要换个新尿布
She needs a new diaper.

434
00:16:10,580 --> 00:16:12,310
对  你的尿布放哪了
Right. Where do you keep your diapers?

435
00:16:12,320 --> 00:16:13,530
我们没有
We don't have any.

436
00:16:13,530 --> 00:16:15,300
你们居然没有
You don't... Wow.

437
00:16:15,300 --> 00:16:18,740
好吧  看来我要去买点了
Okay. I guess I'll go buy some.

438
00:16:19,120 --> 00:16:21,020
你已经是准妈妈了  怎么还没准备尿布呢
You're gonna be a mom and you don't have any diapers?

439
00:16:21,020 --> 00:16:22,640
天啊  看好那臭孩子啊
Lord, watch over that child.

440
00:16:24,830 --> 00:16:26,260
好吧
Uh, okay.

441
00:16:26,260 --> 00:16:27,730
宝贝儿  阿姨抱抱
Come here, you.

442
00:16:27,780 --> 00:16:31,780
刚是有人说有干酪盘吃吗
So, there's a talk of a cheese plate?

443
00:16:43,270 --> 00:16:44,460
来点奶酪[笑一个]
Cheese?

444
00:16:43,270 --> 00:16:44,460
{\an8}国外在拍照时喜欢喊"Cheese"  相当与中国的"茄子"

445
00:16:44,930 --> 00:16:46,090
谢谢
Thanks.

446
00:16:49,710 --> 00:16:51,080
如果不介意的话  我想问
If you don't mind me asking...

447
00:16:51,750 --> 00:16:53,380
到底出什么事吗
What-what is this all about?

448
00:16:53,900 --> 00:16:57,580
你是我认识的人中最坚强  最独立
I mean, you are one of the most strong, independent,

449
00:16:57,580 --> 00:16:59,070
最不可能在感恩节
non-locking-themselves-in-

450
00:16:59,070 --> 00:17:01,330
把自己锁在厕所里的人
a-bathroom-on-Thanksgiving people I know.

451
00:17:02,250 --> 00:17:05,000
为什么我们搬家能让你如此失控
Why-why are you so upset about us moving?

452
00:17:06,010 --> 00:17:08,560
或许我比你们想象中需要你们
Maybe I just need you guys more than you think.

453
00:17:09,690 --> 00:17:13,040
所以与搬家无关  你在借题发挥吗
Is this about more than us moving?

454
00:17:14,150 --> 00:17:15,480
这奶酪味道不错
This is good cheese.

455
00:17:17,440 --> 00:17:18,580
罗宾
Robin?

456
00:17:19,380 --> 00:17:20,600
干嘛
Yeah?

457
00:17:20,700 --> 00:17:22,780
你觉得我该去当捉鬼特工队员吗
Do you think I should've become a Ghostbuster?

458
00:17:23,050 --> 00:17:24,930
我相信你当初的决定是对的  老兄
I think you made the right call, buddy.

459
00:17:26,360 --> 00:17:29,720
泰德  我就不问巴尼从哪弄来这孩子了
Okay, Ted, I'm not gonna ask you where Barney got this baby.

460
00:17:29,850 --> 00:17:32,170
可你知道他为什么这样做吗
But do you have any idea why?

461
00:17:32,300 --> 00:17:34,840
前几天  我们聊到了
Well, a few nights ago, we were talking...

462
00:17:34,880 --> 00:17:37,320
"女生真讨厌  咱俩要是搞基就好了"
you know, "We hate girls, we wish we were gay,"

463
00:17:37,320 --> 00:17:38,690
像这样的大男人话题
just guy stuff.

464
00:17:39,160 --> 00:17:42,590
然后我们当时似乎决定
And we kind of sort of decided to...

465
00:17:43,110 --> 00:17:44,110
领养一个孩子
adopt a baby.

466
00:17:44,110 --> 00:17:45,420
这可真疯狂
Yeah, that's crazy.

467
00:17:45,420 --> 00:17:46,690
我就说嘛
I know.

468
00:17:47,020 --> 00:17:48,930
-真的很疯狂吗  -确定一定以及肯定
- Is it, though? - Yes.

469
00:17:48,930 --> 00:17:50,250
我就说嘛
I know.

470
00:17:50,360 --> 00:17:52,090
-没有那么疯狂吧  -否认否决以及否定
- But is it, though? - Yes.

471
00:17:52,090 --> 00:17:54,000
就算是疯狂又如何
Well, so what if it's crazy?

472
00:17:54,000 --> 00:17:55,670
我一直在等待一个能跟我组建家庭的人
I've been ready to meet someone to start a family with

473
00:17:55,670 --> 00:17:57,910
可我至今还没遇上
for a long time now, and I keep not meeting her.

474
00:17:57,910 --> 00:17:59,790
巴尼是我世上最好的朋友
Barney is one of my best friends in the world,

475
00:17:59,790 --> 00:18:01,190
我们很少吵架
we rarely fight,

476
00:18:01,190 --> 00:18:02,920
一旦我们谈妥宠物眼镜蛇这个问题
and once we iron out the whole pet cobra thing,

477
00:18:02,920 --> 00:18:04,910
我们会是绝佳老爸
we will be amazing dads.

478
00:18:04,910 --> 00:18:06,660
我们为什么不能尝试一下呢
Why shouldn't we try this?

479
00:18:06,780 --> 00:18:08,430
你上一次喂她是什么时候
When's the last time you fed her?

480
00:18:08,430 --> 00:18:10,250
在火车上给她喝了点根汁汽水
She had some root beer on the train.

481
00:18:10,370 --> 00:18:12,050
天啊  泰德  我很抱歉
Oh, Ted. And I'm sorry,

482
00:18:12,050 --> 00:18:14,030
你可不能给孩子取名小旋风
but you cannot call a baby Hurricane.

483
00:18:14,030 --> 00:18:16,120
其实  她的名字叫赛迪
Actually, her name is Sadie.

484
00:18:16,280 --> 00:18:18,200
詹姆斯  你到这儿来干嘛
James, what are you doing here?

485
00:18:18,300 --> 00:18:19,620
巴尼没告诉你们
Did Barney not tell you

486
00:18:19,620 --> 00:18:21,150
我们要来过感恩节吗
that we were coming for Thanksgiving?

487
00:18:21,450 --> 00:18:22,620
没有
Uh, no.

488
00:18:22,630 --> 00:18:24,850
那他可能也没告诉你们
Then he probably also did not tell you

489
00:18:24,860 --> 00:18:27,500
他在照看我们新领养的女儿
that he was babysitting our new daughter.

490
00:18:27,600 --> 00:18:29,230
这是你的女儿吗
This is your daughter?

491
00:18:29,230 --> 00:18:30,850
谢天谢地
Oh, thank God.

492
00:18:30,880 --> 00:18:32,530
恭喜你们
And congratulations.

493
00:18:32,530 --> 00:18:34,290
谢了  过来吧
Thanks. Come here.

494
00:18:36,550 --> 00:18:39,400
看来得说再见了  小旋  赛迪
I guess this is good-bye, Hurri... Sadie.

495
00:18:40,300 --> 00:18:42,570
你名叫小旋风  要永记心中哦
Your name is Hurricane. Don't ever forget it.

496
00:18:44,170 --> 00:18:45,190
让爸爸抱
Go with him.

497
00:18:45,190 --> 00:18:46,790
来吧  乖女儿
Come here. That a girl.

498
00:18:47,470 --> 00:18:48,800
泰德
Hey, Ted,

499
00:18:48,970 --> 00:18:50,970
我不小心听到了你那番话
I overheard your little speech.

500
00:18:51,110 --> 00:18:52,470
你们没有发疯
It's not crazy.

501
00:18:53,040 --> 00:18:54,110
十年之前
About ten years ago,

502
00:18:54,110 --> 00:18:56,620
我和我的好友差点做了同样的事
my best friend and I nearly did the same thing.

503
00:18:57,210 --> 00:19:01,010
我俩都单身  我们都想有个家
She was single, I was single, we both wanted a family.

504
00:19:01,070 --> 00:19:02,490
这么做不足为奇
It made sense.

505
00:19:02,880 --> 00:19:04,050
可现在呢
But now?

506
00:19:04,300 --> 00:19:08,470
每天我们都感谢上天  没让我们做傻事
Every day, we thank our lucky stars that we didn't do it.

507
00:19:08,500 --> 00:19:10,740
因为她和她丈夫所拥有的
'Cause what she found with her husband

508
00:19:10,760 --> 00:19:12,750
我和我爱人所拥有的
and what I found with mine--

509
00:19:13,210 --> 00:19:14,550
值得为之等待
it was worth the wait.

510
00:19:16,420 --> 00:19:17,790
小旋风这名挺酷的
Hurricane's a cool name.

511
00:19:17,800 --> 00:19:19,890
我就说嘛  汤姆
Isn't it, Tom?

512
00:19:21,390 --> 00:19:22,410
宠物店离这里比较近
The pet store was closer,

513
00:19:22,410 --> 00:19:23,630
我就给她买了点狗用尿不湿
so I just got her some wee-wee pads.

514
00:19:23,630 --> 00:19:24,850
我还买了这个
Oh, I also got this.

515
00:19:24,850 --> 00:19:27,400
这是牛肉味的  对她长牙有帮助哦[狗咬胶]
It's beef-flavored and it's good for her teeth.

516
00:19:28,310 --> 00:19:31,180
詹姆斯  汤姆  你们来了
James! Tom! Hey!

517
00:19:31,180 --> 00:19:32,360
莉莉
Lily...

518
00:19:32,990 --> 00:19:36,680
你收到我那封关于邀请了詹姆斯和汤姆
did you get the e-mail that I sent you about inviting

519
00:19:36,680 --> 00:19:38,560
来过感恩节的邮件了吗
James and Tom to Thanksgiving?

520
00:19:38,570 --> 00:19:41,780
我发到你美邮网邮箱里了  你常用那个对吧
I sent it to your CompuServe. That's your main one, right?

521
00:19:38,570 --> 00:19:41,780
{\an8}CompuServe已于2009年关闭邮箱服务

522
00:19:42,070 --> 00:19:43,370
感恩节快乐  老弟
Happy Thanksgiving, bro.

523
00:19:43,370 --> 00:19:45,390
谢了
Thanks. Hi. Hey!

524
00:19:51,310 --> 00:19:52,580
好吧  让你发现了
All right, you got me.

525
00:19:52,580 --> 00:19:54,510
詹姆斯就是我的人贩子
James is my baby guy.

526
00:19:54,510 --> 00:19:57,650
可刚才这三小时真是不可思议  对吧
But these past three hours-- magical, right?

527
00:19:57,660 --> 00:20:00,400
我们能搞定的  快说我们能搞定
We can do this! Say we can do this.

528
00:20:00,480 --> 00:20:02,050
我们搞不定的
We can't do this.

529
00:20:02,320 --> 00:20:03,520
抱歉了  老兄
Sorry, dude.

530
00:20:03,640 --> 00:20:05,280
真爱需要耐心等待
We got to wait for the real thing...

531
00:20:05,880 --> 00:20:07,680
衣带渐宽终不悔
no matter how tough it gets.

532
00:20:11,150 --> 00:20:12,610
为伊消得人憔悴
It gets pretty tough.

533
00:20:12,970 --> 00:20:14,480
那也没办法  兄弟
I know it does, buddy.

534
00:20:17,820 --> 00:20:18,960
离晚饭开始还有点时间吧
I have some time before dinner, right?

535
00:20:18,960 --> 00:20:20,140
我要出去散散步
I'm going to go... I'm gonna take a little walk.

536
00:20:20,140 --> 00:20:21,330
行
All right.

537
00:20:25,050 --> 00:20:26,290
苍天啊
God.

538
00:20:43,040 --> 00:20:44,340
我们还是朋友吧
Are we still friends?

539
00:20:44,740 --> 00:20:45,850
我希望如此
Hope so.

540
00:20:48,040 --> 00:20:48,680
那就好
Good.

541
00:20:48,680 --> 00:20:50,510
听好了
'Cause get this.

542
00:20:50,510 --> 00:20:52,850
泰德差点领养了一个孩子
Ted almost adopted a baby.

543
00:20:53,850 --> 00:20:55,500
疯狂吧
Crazy, right?

544
00:20:55,980 --> 00:20:57,370
可怜的家伙  日子不好过啊
Poor guy's going through some stuff.

545
00:20:57,370 --> 00:20:59,640
他还想把我也拖下水
He actually tried to rope me into it.

546
00:20:59,830 --> 00:21:02,460
你能想象我当爹的样子吗
Can you imagine me being someone's dad?

547
00:21:03,670 --> 00:21:04,960
我怀孕了
I'm pregnant.
