她第三次被寄养家庭赶出来
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}She was kicked out of her third home

3
00:00:11,960 --> 00:00:13,500
是因为她的养母指责她
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}because her foster mother accused her

4
00:00:13,500 --> 00:00:15,130
试图勾引她的丈夫

{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}- You did those things? - You can't believe

-你都不能信  -老天  看着点
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}- a fucking word he says! - Jade, watch out!

8
00:00:22,680 --> 00:00:23,630
我们给他注射前
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}Before we put him out,

9
00:00:23,640 --> 00:00:24,960
他给你写了留言
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}he wrote you this note.

10
00:00:25,390 --> 00:00:26,840
说这很重要
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}Said it was important.

11
00:00:26,930 --> 00:00:27,970
-你跟他说了话吗  -没有
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}- Did you talk to him? - No.

12
00:00:27,970 --> 00:00:30,060
泰勒来监狱看了我
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}Taylor came to see me in jail.

13
00:00:30,060 --> 00:00:33,010
你这次把我害惨了
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}You really fucked me this time!

14
00:00:36,190 --> 00:00:38,480
两位在俱乐部的会员资格被取消了
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}Your membership to the club has been revoked.

15
00:00:38,480 --> 00:00:40,060
因为我生病了
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}It's because I'm ill.

16
00:00:40,780 --> 00:00:42,350
是你干的
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}It was you.

17
00:00:42,570 --> 00:00:45,280
你勾引了我的孩子
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}You seduced my child.

18
00:00:45,280 --> 00:00:47,030
你真以为只是把你赶出乡村俱乐部
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}Do you think that I would be satisfied

19
00:00:47,030 --> 00:00:49,190
我就会满意了吗
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}just getting you kicked out of a country club?

20
00:00:49,240 --> 00:00:52,710
我才刚开始呢  贱人
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}I am just getting started, bitch.

21
00:00:52,710 --> 00:00:54,460
爸总是说你报复心很重
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}Dad always said that you were vindictive.

22
00:00:54,460 --> 00:00:56,130
我还是你妈妈
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}I am still your mother.

23
00:00:56,130 --> 00:00:59,210
不  从现在起  你只是我曾认识的一个女人
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}No, from now on, you're just some lady that I used to know.

24
00:00:59,210 --> 00:01:01,080
-你要开走吗  -先不走
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}- You pulling out? - Not yet.

25
00:01:01,170 --> 00:01:02,920
我在等人
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}I'm waiting for someone.

26
00:01:04,090 --> 00:01:06,340
我丈夫喜欢拿床头柜抽屉里
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}My husband likes to threaten me with a loaded gun

27
00:01:06,340 --> 00:01:08,010
上了膛的枪威胁我
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}he keeps in his bedside drawer.

28
00:01:08,010 --> 00:01:10,600
我们的女儿因我而死
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}Our daughter died because of me.

29
00:01:10,600 --> 00:01:13,100
闯祸的是我
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}I'm the one who's responsible.

30
00:01:13,100 --> 00:01:15,190
我最后一次和你丈夫上床
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}The last time I slept with your husband

31
00:01:15,190 --> 00:01:16,690
是在你孩子死的那天
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}was the day your child died.

32
00:01:16,690 --> 00:01:18,560
你们从前门进来的时候
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}While you were coming in the front door,

33
00:01:18,570 --> 00:01:20,690
我绕着房子跑出去
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}I ran around the side of the house.

34
00:01:20,690 --> 00:01:23,570
罗伯知道你没有关门吗
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}Did Rob know you had not closed the gate?

35
00:01:23,570 --> 00:01:26,020
我那晚跟他打了电话  告诉了他
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}I called him that night and I told him.

36
00:01:26,160 --> 00:01:27,530
有什么需要帮助的
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}What can I do for you?

37
00:01:27,530 --> 00:01:29,230
我要买把枪
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}I need to buy a gun.

41
00:02:50,280 --> 00:02:52,660
很不错  建筑面积
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}It's impressive. Square footage?

42

楼上有四个大卧室

45

{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}Got kids?

46
00:02:58,120 --> 00:02:59,530
之前有个女儿
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}We had a little girl.

47
00:02:59,920 --> 00:03:01,410
她叫艾米莉
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}Her name was Emily.

48
00:03:02,380 --> 00:03:03,380
之前
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}Was?

49
00:03:03,380 --> 00:03:05,790
我们失陪一下
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}Could you excuse us a moment?

50
00:03:11,260 --> 00:03:15,340
你能别再告诉陌生人我们女儿死了吗
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}You've got to stop telling total strangers our daughter died.

51
00:03:15,430 --> 00:03:17,180
他问了我一个问题
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}He asked me a question.

52
00:03:17,180 --> 00:03:19,340
已经过了一年多了
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}It's been over a year.

53
00:03:19,480 --> 00:03:21,270
要是我们一直谈论发生了什么
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}How are we gonna move forward in our lives

54
00:03:21,270 --> 00:03:23,190
我们的生活要怎么翻篇
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}if we keep talking about what happened?

55
00:03:23,190 --> 00:03:24,900
我都不知道我们在这做什么
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}I don't even understand what we're doing here.

56
00:03:24,900 --> 00:03:26,440
我们现在的房子挺好的
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}The house we have now is fine.

57
00:03:26,440 --> 00:03:27,850
有太多回忆
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}It's got too many memories.

58
00:03:28,490 --> 00:03:29,980
我们需要一个崭新的开始
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}We need a fresh start.

59
00:03:31,410 --> 00:03:33,360
这可能对我们来说是好事
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}I mean, this could be good for us.

60
00:03:33,450 --> 00:03:35,860
你不想找到再次幸福的办法吗
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}Don't you want to find a way to be happy again?

61
00:03:36,160 --> 00:03:37,410
我当然想了
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}Of course I do.

62
00:03:37,410 --> 00:03:39,200
那就让我为你买下这房子
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}Well, then let me buy this for you.

63
00:03:39,210 --> 00:03:41,500
如果你这么做  我就会每天
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}If you do that, I'll spend every day

64
00:03:41,500 --> 00:03:44,540
都努力让笑容重回你的脸上
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}just trying to put the smile back on your face.

65
00:03:44,920 --> 00:03:46,870
我当初爱上的那个笑容
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}The one I fell in love with.

66
00:03:50,430 --> 00:03:52,250
我想我们是可以在这找到幸福
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}I guess we could be happy here.

67
00:03:52,300 --> 00:03:53,750
当然可以
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}Of course we can.

68
00:03:56,310 --> 00:03:58,630
给我展示下我爱的那个笑容
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}Now where's that smile I love?

69
00:03:59,850 --> 00:04:01,640
我昨天买了把枪
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}I bought a gun yesterday.

70
00:04:03,560 --> 00:04:04,230
什么
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}What?

71
00:04:04,230 --> 00:04:06,070
我从我的癌症医生那看完病后
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}I'd left an appointment at my cancer doctors,

72
00:04:06,070 --> 00:04:09,060
我经过了一家超可爱的枪支商店
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}and I passed the most adorable gun shop.

73
00:04:09,530 --> 00:04:11,440
我买了一把小左轮手枪
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}And I bought this little revolver.

74
00:04:12,780 --> 00:04:14,490
我们要枪做什么
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}Why do we need a gun?

75
00:04:14,490 --> 00:04:16,450
最近附近有发生盗窃
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}There have been robberies in the neighborhood.

76
00:04:16,450 --> 00:04:18,040
街角的贝茨夫人
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}Mrs. Betz on the corner?

77
00:04:18,040 --> 00:04:20,500
一个小偷砸碎了她家窗户  闯进去
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}Some thief smashed her window, reached in,

78
00:04:20,500 --> 00:04:23,370
从她的茶几上拿走了她新买的包
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}and took her new purse right off her end table.

79
00:04:23,380 --> 00:04:24,880
-我有见过她吗  -总之
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}- Have I met her? - Anyway,

80
00:04:24,880 --> 00:04:26,210
我感觉不太安全
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}I don't feel safe.

81
00:04:26,210 --> 00:04:29,250
所以我买了这把枪  放在了这里
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}So I got this gun, and I'm storing it here.

82
00:04:29,420 --> 00:04:31,210
已经装了子弹
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}And I've already put in the bullets.

83
00:04:33,550 --> 00:04:35,340
你给枪上膛了
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}You're keeping the gun loaded?

84
00:04:35,350 --> 00:04:37,010
如果有人攻击我们
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}If someone attacks us,

85
00:04:37,010 --> 00:04:39,970
我们应该不想浪费时间去找子弹  对吗
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}I don't think we'd want to waste time looking for bullets. Do you?

86
00:04:40,980 --> 00:04:42,520
这是条和谐的街道
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}This is a nice street.

87
00:04:42,520 --> 00:04:45,390
我们不会出什么坏事的
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}Nothing bad is going to happen to us.

88
00:04:46,060 --> 00:04:47,430
世事难料
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}You never know.

89
00:04:54,740 --> 00:04:55,560
所以...
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}So...

90
00:04:55,910 --> 00:04:56,940
你们觉得怎么样
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}what do you think?

91
00:04:57,410 --> 00:04:59,070
你带我们来真是太对了
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}You were right to bring us here.

92
00:04:59,120 --> 00:05:00,950
这房子能创造太多可能性了
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}So many possibilities.

93
00:05:00,950 --> 00:05:02,040
对  房子格局还不错
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}Yes, the floor plan's good,

94
00:05:02,040 --> 00:05:04,540
但墙上的颜色真是...
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}but really, the color of the walls...

95
00:05:04,540 --> 00:05:05,750
在我们继续之前
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}Before we go any further,

96
00:05:05,750 --> 00:05:09,250
法律强制我揭露这里发生过谋杀
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}state lawcompels me to disclose that a murder took place here.

97
00:05:09,250 --> 00:05:11,550
有人在这栋房子里被杀了吗
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}Someone was murdered in this house?

98
00:05:11,550 --> 00:05:12,960
是粉刷匠吗
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}Was it the decorator?

99
00:05:15,390 --> 00:05:16,890
萨蒙妮
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}Simone!

00:05:19,930 --> 00:05:21,720
我看见你的车在外面
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}I saw your car out front.

102
00:05:21,730 --> 00:05:24,020
快告诉我你们要把这里买下来
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}Tell me that you are buying this place.

103
00:05:24,020 --> 00:05:25,590
我就住在一个街区外
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}I live a block away.

104
00:05:25,600 --> 00:05:27,850
我们能成为邻居了
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}We would be neighbors.

105
00:05:28,230 --> 00:05:30,820
卡尔  这是我乡村俱乐部的朋友娜奥米
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}Karl, this is my friend Naomi from the country club.

106
00:05:30,820 --> 00:05:34,450
你就是那个我一直听说的时髦新男友吧
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}You must be the dashing new boyfriend I keep hearing about.

107
00:05:34,450 --> 00:05:35,950
不仅仅是男友
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}Not just the boyfriend.

108
00:05:35,950 --> 00:05:39,070
-更进一步了  -不会吧
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}- I've, uh, been promoted. - Stop.

109
00:05:39,120 --> 00:05:40,650
你们订婚了
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}You're engaged?

110
00:05:40,830 --> 00:05:43,370
那你们现在肯定需要一所更大的房子了
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}Oh, well, now you definitely need a bigger house.

111
00:05:43,370 --> 00:05:46,160
-这个年轻帅小伙是谁啊  -汤米
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}- And who's this charming young man? - Tommy.

这是我儿子汤米
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}This is my son Tommy.

113
00:05:51,300 --> 00:05:55,080
汤米  这是萨蒙妮
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}Tommy, this is Simone.

114
00:05:55,180 --> 00:05:56,920
你真漂亮
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}You're pretty.

115
00:05:58,300 --> 00:06:00,140
小孩子嘴最甜了
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}Kids say the cutest things.

116
00:06:00,140 --> 00:06:02,560
小伙子别垂涎了  她名花有主了
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}Oh, hands off, young man. She's spoken for.

117
00:06:02,560 --> 00:06:05,480
萨蒙妮  拜托你们一定要买下这房子
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}Oh, Simone, please tell me you'll take the house.

118
00:06:05,480 --> 00:06:08,770
我太想你搬过来住了
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}I'd absolutely kill to have you here.

119
00:06:08,770 --> 00:06:10,310
那一定会很有趣  不是吗
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}Oh, it would be fun, wouldn't it?

120
00:06:10,320 --> 00:06:12,480
住在我最好朋友的家附近
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}Being close to my best friend.

121
00:06:27,460 --> 00:06:28,530
萨蒙妮
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}Simone!

122
00:06:39,720 --> 00:06:40,630
你没事吧
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}Are you all right?

123
00:06:40,930 --> 00:06:41,880
我的天啊
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}Oh, my God.

124
00:06:43,350 --> 00:06:44,420
发生什么了
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}What happened?

125
00:06:46,430 --> 00:06:48,140
我妈妈想杀了你
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}My mother tried to kill you.

126
00:06:48,140 --> 00:06:49,220
什么
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}What?

127
00:06:50,480 --> 00:06:52,140
我的天  她还活着吗
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}Oh, my God, is she alive?

128
00:06:55,280 --> 00:06:56,270
汤米
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}Tommy.

129
00:06:57,110 --> 00:06:58,690
快叫医生
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}Someone call a doctor!

130
00:06:59,030 --> 00:07:00,610
-好  -还有警察
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}- Okay. - And the police!

131
00:07:13,250 --> 00:07:16,080
那么...你们觉得怎么样
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}So... what do you think?

132
00:07:17,880 --> 00:07:21,540
我觉得...我很喜欢  就这么定了吧
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}I mean... I love it. I say, let's do it.

133
00:07:22,050 --> 00:07:24,020
-什么  -我想买这栋房子
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}- What? - I want to buy this house.

134
00:07:25,220 --> 00:07:28,220
我能跟我丈夫私下商量一下吗
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}Can I talk with my husband for a moment in private, please?

135
00:07:28,560 --> 00:07:29,840
慢慢来
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}Take your time.

136
00:07:32,360 --> 00:07:34,640
-怎么了  -老兄  你疯了吗
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}- What? - Dude, are you crazy?

137
00:07:34,770 --> 00:07:37,140
你疯...你没看到那个泳池吗
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}Are you cra...? Did you not see that pool?

138
00:07:37,570 --> 00:07:38,400
而且厨房很大
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}And that kitchen is huge.

139
00:07:38,400 --> 00:07:41,320
对  但是需要彻底重新装修  我们没那么多钱
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}Yeah, and it needs a complete remodel. We can't afford that.

140
00:07:41,320 --> 00:07:43,160
别担心钱的事  好吗
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}D-Don't worry about the money, all right?

141
00:07:43,160 --> 00:07:44,200
我的事业快起飞了
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}My career is taking off.

142
00:07:44,200 --> 00:07:46,490
《昨日珍妮》的评论爆了
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}The reviews for Jenny from Yesterday are through the roof.

143
00:07:46,490 --> 00:07:48,990
我知道  但即便如此还是太冒险了
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}Yeah, I know, but even so, it's still risky.

144
00:07:49,250 --> 00:07:51,620
冒险  你听听你自己说的话
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}Risky? Are you hearing yourself right now?

145
00:07:51,620 --> 00:07:53,750
-你知道你听起来像谁吗  -谁
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}- Do you know who you sound like? - Who?

146
00:07:53,750 --> 00:07:56,250
像我  当我们谈开放婚姻的时候
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}Me... when we were talking about having an open marriage?

147
00:07:56,250 --> 00:07:57,170
好吧  这不是一回事
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}Okay, that's not the same thing.

148
00:07:57,170 --> 00:07:59,090
不  我...我当时很紧张
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}No. I was... I was nervous.

149
00:07:59,090 --> 00:08:01,090
我不确定我们能否适应  但你说服了我
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}I was unsure that we could make it work, but you convinced me.

150
00:08:01,090 --> 00:08:04,090
现在我们的日子过得多刺激呀
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}And now our life is so much more exciting for it.

151
00:08:04,140 --> 00:08:06,310
你想想如果有了这厨房  我们的日子
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}Now think about how much even more exciting our life would be

152
00:08:06,310 --> 00:08:08,760
能刺激到什么程度  对吧
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}with that fucking kitchen, right?

153
00:08:08,890 --> 00:08:11,050
宝贝  你感冒还没好吗
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}Oh, sweetie, you still have that cold?

154
00:08:11,140 --> 00:08:12,390
好了  我没事  我没事
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}It's fine. I'm good. I'm good.

155
00:08:12,400 --> 00:08:14,600
泰勒  相信我
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}Just, Taylor, trust me.

156
00:08:14,730 --> 00:08:16,180
好吗  相信我
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}Okay? Believe in me.

157
00:08:16,360 --> 00:08:18,730
我发誓我不会让你失望的
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}I promise you I will not let you down.

158
00:08:20,110 --> 00:08:21,520
慢点
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}Take it slow.

159
00:08:22,110 --> 00:08:23,860
天啊  全身都痛
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}God, everything hurts.

160
00:08:24,410 --> 00:08:25,870
好吧  有件事能让你舒服些
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}Well, here's something to ease the pain.

161
00:08:25,870 --> 00:08:28,820
我回了趟家  所有洁德的东西都没了
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}I went by the house. All of Jade's stuff is gone.

162
00:08:29,580 --> 00:08:30,820
动作真快
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}That was fast.

163
00:08:31,250 --> 00:08:33,920
对  她知道我们知道她干了什么
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}Yeah. Well, she knows we're onto her.

164
00:08:33,920 --> 00:08:36,160
她总不能待在那等警察来抓她吧
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}She can't just stick around, waiting for the cops to show up.

165
00:08:37,920 --> 00:08:39,460
说到房子
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}Oh, speaking of the house,

166
00:08:39,460 --> 00:08:42,050
我有个东西给你
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}I, uh, got you a little something.

167
00:08:42,050 --> 00:08:43,130
一张名片吗
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}A business card?

168
00:08:43,130 --> 00:08:45,750
对  拉马尔的房产经纪人
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}Yeah. For Lamar's realtor.

169
00:08:46,760 --> 00:08:48,520
如果你同意的话我想把房子卖了
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}If it's okay with you, I want to sell the house.

170
00:08:50,270 --> 00:08:51,260
真的吗
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}Really?

171
00:08:51,680 --> 00:08:52,560
对  感觉
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}Yeah, it just feels like

172
00:08:52,560 --> 00:08:54,320
我们的每个错误决定都能追溯到
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}every wrong turn we've made can be traced back

173
00:08:54,320 --> 00:08:56,070
我让你买房子的那一刻
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}to the moment where I talked you into buying it.

174
00:08:56,810 --> 00:08:57,400
没有房子
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}No house...

175
00:08:57,400 --> 00:08:58,520
就不会遇见洁德
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}wouldn't have met Jade.

176
00:08:58,860 --> 00:09:00,080
没有洁德  不会毒瘾复发
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}No Jade, no relapse.

177
00:09:01,400 --> 00:09:03,530
我们会少很多压力
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}I mean, we'd lose a lot of stress.

178
00:09:03,530 --> 00:09:05,190
光是不还房贷就轻松很多
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}The mortgage payments alone.

179
00:09:07,990 --> 00:09:09,400
看看那笑容
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}Look at that smile.

180
00:09:10,790 --> 00:09:13,740
好吧  那我们要降级到什么
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}All right. So how much downsizing are we up for?

181
00:09:14,170 --> 00:09:16,280
联排别墅  公寓
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}Townhouse? Condo?

182
00:09:16,420 --> 00:09:18,710
去他的  我们干脆买块地
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}Fuck it. Let's just buy a field.

183
00:09:18,710 --> 00:09:19,890
扎个帐篷
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}We can pitch a tent.

184
00:09:20,710 --> 00:09:21,710
棒极了
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}Love it.

185
00:09:21,880 --> 00:09:23,590
田野上的帐篷  美梦成真了
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}Tent in a field. We'd be living the dream.

186
00:09:23,590 --> 00:09:26,840
而且搬家最棒的地方在于  洁德找不到我们
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}And the best part about moving... Jade won't be able to find us.

187
00:09:28,760 --> 00:09:30,010
你觉得她去哪了
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}Where do you think she went?

188
00:09:30,100 --> 00:09:31,090
不知道
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}I don't know.

189
00:09:31,470 --> 00:09:33,880
最好现在已经千里之外了
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}Let's just hope she's a thousand miles away by now.

190
00:09:36,010 --> 00:09:37,390
{\an8}{\fs18\fsp2\fn方正兰亭黑简体\b1\bord0\blur0\shad0\fad(0,0)}给我的杜克

191
00:09:38,190 --> 00:09:39,140
谁是杜克
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}Who's Duke?

192
00:09:39,770 --> 00:09:41,020
我祖父
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}My grandfather.

193
00:09:41,730 --> 00:09:44,910
祖母苏在第一年结婚纪念日是送给他的
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}Grammy Sue gave that to him for their first wedding anniversary.

194
00:09:45,450 --> 00:09:47,570
他每天都戴  却从未上过发条
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}He wore it every day, but he never wound it.

195
00:09:47,570 --> 00:09:49,110
他总说
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}He always used to say that

196
00:09:49,950 --> 00:09:53,240
"当我遇见小苏时  仿佛时间都静止了"
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}"When I met my Susie, it was like time stood still."

197
00:09:54,500 --> 00:09:55,450
真甜蜜
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}Sweet.

198
00:09:57,170 --> 00:09:58,450
给你35
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}Give you 35.

199
00:09:58,630 --> 00:09:59,290
三千五吗
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}Hundred?

200
00:09:59,290 --> 00:10:01,160
不  35块
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}No. Dollars.

201
00:10:01,550 --> 00:10:03,260
它比那值钱多了
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}It's worth much more than that.

202
00:10:03,260 --> 00:10:04,960
从情感的角度来说  也许吧
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}Sentimental-wise, maybe.

203
00:10:05,260 --> 00:10:07,790
但想兑现  就值35
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}Cash-wise, it's worth $35.

204
00:10:07,970 --> 00:10:09,810
-我需要更多  -好吧
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}- Well, I need more. - All right.

205
00:10:10,680 --> 00:10:13,410
为你这故事我再添五块
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}I'll throw in an extra five for the story.

206
00:10:13,810 --> 00:10:16,800
因为我喜欢你的脸
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}And 'cause I like your... face.

207
00:10:24,110 --> 00:10:25,690
不如一千吧
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}How about a grand?

208
00:10:25,780 --> 00:10:26,900
我没那么喜欢你的脸
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}I don't like your face that much.

209
00:10:26,900 --> 00:10:28,410
好吧  那就几百块
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}Okay, well, then a couple hundred.

210
00:10:28,410 --> 00:10:30,320
-亲爱的  我说了  -拜托
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}- Honey, I told you... - Please.

211
00:10:30,320 --> 00:10:32,450
你不知道我最近经历了什么
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}You don't understand what I've been through lately.

212
00:10:32,450 --> 00:10:35,120
我失去了一切  我只需要一点
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}I've lost everything, and I just need a little...

213
00:10:35,120 --> 00:10:37,620
你需要的是收起那假惺惺的眼泪
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}What you need is to give the waterworks a rest.

214
00:10:37,620 --> 00:10:39,710
我开价了  你爱要不要
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}I made you my offer, so either take it

215
00:10:39,710 --> 00:10:40,910
不要出去
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}or get the hell out.

216
00:10:50,800 --> 00:10:53,020
搞什么  我报警了
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}The fuck?! I'm calling the cops!

217
00:10:54,770 --> 00:10:57,010
嗯  这话我听得多了
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}Yeah, I get that a lot.

218
00:11:16,500 --> 00:11:17,330
贝丝·安
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}Beth Ann.

219
00:11:17,330 --> 00:11:19,540
早上好  玛丽  我希望我没打扰你
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}Morning, Mary. I hope I'm not interrupting?

220
00:11:19,540 --> 00:11:21,500
不  完全没有  拉尔夫刚去上班
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}No, not at all. Ralph just left for work.

221
00:11:21,500 --> 00:11:23,250
我知道  我特地等他走了才来
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}I know. I waited for him to go.

222
00:11:23,250 --> 00:11:25,040
我要和你私下谈谈
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}I need to speak to you privately.

223
00:11:25,130 --> 00:11:26,640
-怎么了  -我想到了一个
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}- What's going on? - I've thought of a way

224
00:11:26,640 --> 00:11:29,540
能解决我们各自婚姻问题的方法
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}to solve our respective marital difficulties.

225
00:11:30,970 --> 00:11:31,920
真的吗
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}You have?

226
00:11:32,220 --> 00:11:34,760
我想到了如何杀死我们丈夫的主意
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}I've come up with a plan on how to kill our husbands.

227
00:11:36,770 --> 00:11:38,220
请我进屋吧
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}Please invite me in.

228
00:11:38,850 --> 00:11:41,470
这种事我们该边喝咖啡边聊
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}This is the sort of thing we should discuss over coffee.

229
00:11:53,910 --> 00:11:55,070
这就是计划
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}That's the plan.

230
00:11:55,990 --> 00:11:57,190
有什么想法吗
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}Any thoughts?

231
00:11:57,450 --> 00:11:58,740
太疯狂了
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}It's crazy.

232
00:11:59,370 --> 00:12:01,160
-我们会被抓的  -不会
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}- We'd never get away with it. - But we would.

233
00:12:01,170 --> 00:12:03,170
你想想  严格来说
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}Think about it. Technically speaking,

234
00:12:03,170 --> 00:12:05,010
我们没做任何违法的事
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}we wouldn't be doing anything illegal.

235
00:12:05,710 --> 00:12:07,090
那我们怎么知道罗伯和拉尔夫
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}How could we be sure that Rob and Ralph

236
00:12:07,090 --> 00:12:08,130
会上这个当呢
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}would even swallow the bait?

237
00:12:08,130 --> 00:12:10,010
这就是这个计划的精妙之处
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}That's the beauty of the plan.

238
00:12:10,010 --> 00:12:11,220
这计划完全是为
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}It's tailor-made to fit

239
00:12:11,220 --> 00:12:13,780
他们糟糕透顶的性格量身定做
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}their horribly predictable personalities.

240
00:12:17,010 --> 00:12:18,800
如果有人发现我们做了什么怎么办
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}What if someone discovers what we've done?

241
00:12:19,520 --> 00:12:21,310
我没打算告诉别人
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}I don't plan on telling anyone.

242
00:12:21,310 --> 00:12:22,180
你呢
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}Do you?

243
00:12:22,850 --> 00:12:23,560
我不知道
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}I don't know.

244
00:12:23,560 --> 00:12:25,430
拉尔夫是该死
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}Ralph deserves to die.

245
00:12:25,770 --> 00:12:29,180
罗伯让你经受了那么多苦楚
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}And... after everything Rob's put you through,

246
00:12:29,320 --> 00:12:30,770
他也一样坏
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}he's just as bad.

247
00:12:32,160 --> 00:12:33,820
但《圣经》说
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}But the Bible says,

248
00:12:33,820 --> 00:12:35,690
"不可杀人"
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}"Thou shalt not kill."

249
00:12:37,580 --> 00:12:39,240
上帝也许不会理解
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}God might not understand.

250
00:12:39,250 --> 00:12:40,360
也许不会
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}Maybe not.

251
00:12:40,460 --> 00:12:42,050
但我肯定上帝的妻子会
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}But I'm sure God's wife will.

252
00:12:43,790 --> 00:12:44,950
那么  你怎么说
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}Now, what do you say?

253
00:12:49,130 --> 00:12:50,810
汤米
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}Oh. Tommy.

254
00:12:51,380 --> 00:12:53,130
你看上去见到我很惊讶
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}You seem surprised to see me.

255
00:12:53,430 --> 00:12:55,640
我们现在是社交瘟疫  人人避之
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}Well, we're such social pariahs these days,

256
00:12:55,640 --> 00:12:57,380
我见到谁都很惊讶
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}I'm surprised to see anyone.

257
00:12:58,140 --> 00:12:59,970
现在要是有耶和华见证人上门
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}At this point, I'd roll out the red carpet

258
00:12:59,970 --> 00:13:01,230
我都要铺红毯了
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}for a Jehovah's Witness.

259
00:13:02,850 --> 00:13:03,970
你感觉如何
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}How are you feeling?

260
00:13:04,020 --> 00:13:05,180
很好
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}Delightful.

261
00:13:05,690 --> 00:13:07,350
萨蒙妮在厨房里
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}Simone's in the kitchen.

262
00:13:25,000 --> 00:13:26,880
你妈妈的物理治疗怎么样
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}How is your mother's physical therapy going?

263
00:13:26,880 --> 00:13:27,740
好点了
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}Better.

264
00:13:28,170 --> 00:13:30,040
她今天走了几步
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}She took a few steps today.

265
00:13:30,050 --> 00:13:32,250
我还是觉得你应该提起诉讼
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}I still think that you should have pressed charges.

266
00:13:32,800 --> 00:13:34,680
她说她失去了对车的控制
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}She said she lost control of the car.

267
00:13:35,760 --> 00:13:37,340
我选择相信她
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}I choose to believe her.

268
00:13:37,350 --> 00:13:38,670
其他人都不信
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}Nobody else does.

269
00:13:38,800 --> 00:13:40,260
她在乡村俱乐部的所有朋友
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}All of her friends at the country club,

270
00:13:40,260 --> 00:13:42,760
那些让她游说敌对你和卡尔的人
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}the ones that she turned against you and Karl,

271
00:13:42,810 --> 00:13:45,100
最终都发现我妈才是疯子  都抛弃了她
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}they finally found out Mom's crazy and they dropped her.

272
00:13:45,100 --> 00:13:46,850
可怜的娜奥米
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}Oh. Poor Naomi.

273
00:13:47,060 --> 00:13:48,430
可怜的娜奥米
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}"Poor Naomi"?

274
00:13:48,810 --> 00:13:49,810
拜托
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}Come on.

275
00:13:49,820 --> 00:13:51,190
你肯定还是觉得有点高兴吧
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}You must be a little pleased.

276
00:13:51,190 --> 00:13:52,530
我想成为的那种女人
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}The woman I'm trying to become

277
00:13:52,530 --> 00:13:55,020
绝对不会从这种事情中获得愉悦
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}would draw no satisfaction from this at all.

278
00:13:56,240 --> 00:13:58,650
幸运的是  我还没成为那种女人呢
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}Fortunately, I'm not that woman just yet.

279
00:14:00,910 --> 00:14:02,500
我在想要取消去巴黎的旅行
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}I'm thinking about canceling my trip to Paris.

280
00:14:03,080 --> 00:14:05,620
你不能让因为愧对妈妈而影响行程
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}You can't let your mother guilt you into staying.

281
00:14:05,620 --> 00:14:08,240
我留下来是为你  而不是为她
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}I'd be staying for you, not her.

282
00:14:09,090 --> 00:14:10,960
卡尔越来越病重了  对吧
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}Karl's getting worse, isn't he?

283
00:14:10,960 --> 00:14:12,830
我会好好照料他的
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}I'll take good care of him.

284
00:14:13,090 --> 00:14:14,670
那谁来照料你呢
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}But who will take care of you?

285
00:14:14,670 --> 00:14:15,970
我没事的
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}I'll be fine.

286
00:14:15,970 --> 00:14:17,220
你应该走了
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}Oh, you should go.

287
00:14:17,220 --> 00:14:19,210
卡尔有医生的预约
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}Karl has a doctor's appointment.

288
00:14:21,510 --> 00:14:23,680
我很抱歉我们的关系造成了这样的丑闻
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}I'm sorry our relationship caused such a scandal.

289
00:14:23,680 --> 00:14:25,600
我试着告诉别人是我追的你
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}I try to tell people I'm the one who pursued you,

290
00:14:25,600 --> 00:14:28,510
但他们都不愿意相信这是我的错
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}but they refuse to believe it was my fault.

291
00:14:29,110 --> 00:14:31,970
你这么说好像我们做了什么该后悔的事
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}You say that like we did something we should regret.

292
00:14:32,650 --> 00:14:34,910
我没有后悔过我们相处的任何时刻
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}I don't regret one moment we shared.

293
00:14:37,110 --> 00:14:39,030
走吧
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}Now go.

294
00:14:39,030 --> 00:14:41,780
去享受你人生最棒的一个夏天吧
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}Have the most wonderful summer of your life.

295
00:14:41,990 --> 00:14:44,030
学学美术  喝点红酒
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}Study art. Drink wine.

296
00:14:44,540 --> 00:14:46,410
时不时地想想我
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}Think of me every now and then.

297
00:14:47,250 --> 00:14:49,160
我会一直想着你的
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}I'll think of you constantly.

298
00:14:50,750 --> 00:14:51,950
我爱你
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}I love you.

299
00:14:52,960 --> 00:14:55,620
你以后还会对别的女人说这句话
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}I won't be the last woman you say that to.

300
00:14:56,630 --> 00:14:58,630
但我很自豪能成为第一个
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}But I'm proud to be the first.

301
00:15:34,300 --> 00:15:38,300
{\an8}{\fs18\fsp2\fn方正兰亭黑简体\b1\bord0\blur0\shad0\fad(0,0)}六个月后

302
00:15:40,720 --> 00:15:41,880
我拿来了
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}Here it is.

303
00:15:41,890 --> 00:15:44,090
你确定你想把它卖掉吗
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}Now, you're sure you want to part with this?

304
00:15:44,100 --> 00:15:45,100
我很想留下
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}Oh, I'd love to keep it,

305
00:15:45,100 --> 00:15:46,890
但事实上  我们需要钱
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}but the truth is, we need the money.

306
00:15:46,890 --> 00:15:50,350
萨蒙妮  事情已经坏到这个地步了吗
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}Simone, are things really as bad as all that?

307
00:15:50,350 --> 00:15:53,610
画廊倒了后  我们就没有医保了
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}Once the art gallery went under, we lost our health insurance.

308
00:15:53,610 --> 00:15:56,150
卡尔的医疗账单数额高得吓人
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}And Karl's medical bills have been outrageous.

309
00:15:56,150 --> 00:15:57,900
我能做点什么吗
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}Is there anything I can do?

310
00:15:57,900 --> 00:15:59,640
你可以再买一幅画
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}You could buy another painting.

311
00:15:59,950 --> 00:16:02,940
或许你想让我的画像挂在你家客厅里
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}Perhaps you'd like to have me hanging in your living room?

312
00:16:08,080 --> 00:16:10,990
不如我为这幅画再多付你一千美元吧
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}Why don't I just pay you another thousand for this one?

313
00:16:11,540 --> 00:16:12,910
你真是个好人
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}That's very kind.

314
00:16:13,040 --> 00:16:14,830
但又有点侮辱人
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}And somewhat insulting.

315
00:16:15,380 --> 00:16:16,790
保重  科尔
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}Take care, Cole.

316
00:16:20,380 --> 00:16:21,300
萨蒙妮
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}Simone?

317
00:16:21,300 --> 00:16:22,130
怎么了  卡尔
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}Yes, Karl?

318
00:16:23,010 --> 00:16:24,290
我需要你
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}I need you.

319
00:16:29,270 --> 00:16:30,470
你还好吗
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}Is everything okay?

320
00:16:30,560 --> 00:16:32,840
是的  就是想把自己打扮得可以见人
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}Yes, I'm just trying to make myself presentable.

321
00:16:33,350 --> 00:16:34,440
能帮我擦脖子吗
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}Would you do my neck?

322
00:16:34,440 --> 00:16:35,680
当然了
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}Oh, of course.

323
00:16:36,770 --> 00:16:37,940
你要去哪里吗
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}Are you going somewhere?

324
00:16:37,940 --> 00:16:41,140
我的支持小组的蒂姆刚刚出院
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}Tim from my support group's just got out of hospital.

325
00:16:41,320 --> 00:16:43,650
哈罗德要给他办个早午餐会
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}Harold's holding a brunch in his honor.

326
00:16:43,780 --> 00:16:45,240
那真是太好了
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}Oh, that should be nice.

327
00:16:45,240 --> 00:16:47,230
你没尝过他的厨艺
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}You haven't tasted his cooking.

328
00:16:47,580 --> 00:16:50,740
我确定在上甜点之前我们就会回急救室了
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}I'm sure we'll all be back in the emergency room by dessert.

329
00:16:51,210 --> 00:16:52,910
你真贱
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}You are such a bitch.

330
00:16:52,920 --> 00:16:54,530
希望如此
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}I should hope so.

331
00:16:54,790 --> 00:16:57,040
毕竟我师从大师
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}I did study with a master.

332
00:16:58,000 --> 00:16:59,300
我刚听到了门铃
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}Oh, I heard the doorbell.

333
00:16:59,300 --> 00:16:59,920
是谁啊
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}Who was it?

334
00:16:59,920 --> 00:17:01,880
科尔来拿画了
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}Cole stopped by to pick up the painting.

335
00:17:01,880 --> 00:17:04,840
天哪  我感到好内疚
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}Oh, Lord, I feel so dreadful about that.

336
00:17:05,430 --> 00:17:07,720
我知道你有多喜欢那幅画
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}I-I know how much you love that piece.

337
00:17:07,720 --> 00:17:08,710
没关系
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}It's okay.

338
00:17:08,970 --> 00:17:10,600
至少现在能还抵押贷款了
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}At least we can pay the mortgage now.

339
00:17:10,600 --> 00:17:11,680
至少能还掉大部分
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}Or most of it.

340
00:17:14,020 --> 00:17:15,970
我很抱...我很抱歉
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}I am s... I am so sorry.

341
00:17:16,650 --> 00:17:17,810
别说了
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}Stop it.

342
00:17:18,320 --> 00:17:20,770
我们没事
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}We are fine.

343
00:17:21,900 --> 00:17:23,350
你说得对
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}Uh, you are right.

344
00:17:24,700 --> 00:17:26,730
我们是两个...
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}We are, uh, two...

345
00:17:27,320 --> 00:17:28,820
女贱神
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}bitch goddesses.

346
00:17:28,990 --> 00:17:31,150
我们是不会输的
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}And we will not be defeated.

347
00:17:31,370 --> 00:17:32,400
转过去
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}Now turn.

348
00:18:01,900 --> 00:18:04,750
今早出门前我是怎么跟你们交代的
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}What did I tell all you this morning before we left the house?

349
00:18:05,070 --> 00:18:06,940
我是怎么说的
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}Huh? What did I say?

350
00:18:07,280 --> 00:18:08,870
不要给你丢人现眼
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}Not to embarrass you.

351
00:18:08,870 --> 00:18:12,240
都是因为你们几个小鬼对那个倒霉的假人模特干的好事
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}I can never go back to that store ever again

352
00:18:12,240 --> 00:18:15,450
我被那家商店永久拉黑了
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}because of what you little freaks did to that poor mannequin.

353
00:18:19,840 --> 00:18:20,870
快进屋
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}Go inside.

354
00:18:22,090 --> 00:18:23,000
还愣着干嘛
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}Now!

355
00:18:27,470 --> 00:18:28,180
你好
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}Hello.

356
00:18:28,180 --> 00:18:30,170
不知你是否还记得我
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}I'm not sure if you remember who I am.

357
00:18:30,720 --> 00:18:32,050
我知道你是谁
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}I know who you are.

358
00:18:33,600 --> 00:18:35,180
那你能告诉我你是谁吗
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}Can you tell me who you are?

359
00:18:36,480 --> 00:18:38,350
我们先把话说明  亲爱的
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}Let's start with the headline, hon.

360
00:18:38,350 --> 00:18:40,560
我不是罗伯·斯坦顿的老婆
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}I'm not Rob Stanton's wife.

361
00:18:43,650 --> 00:18:44,730
进来吧
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}Come on in.

362
00:18:45,860 --> 00:18:48,690
是时候告诉你真相了
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}I think it's time someone told you the truth.

363
00:18:57,250 --> 00:18:58,280
谢谢你  拉马尔
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}Thank you, Lamar.

364
00:18:58,750 --> 00:19:00,200
你的支持对我很重要
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}Your support means a lot.

365
00:19:01,710 --> 00:19:02,790
好的  没问题
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}Yeah. Yeah.

366
00:19:02,800 --> 00:19:04,790
待我戒毒成功归来  我们再会
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}I will see you on the other side, man.

367
00:19:05,260 --> 00:19:07,460
好的  挂了
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}Okay. Bye.

368
00:19:09,640 --> 00:19:11,880
在我戒毒期间你要如何打发无聊时光呢
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}So, how you gonna stay busy while I'm at rehab?

369
00:19:12,890 --> 00:19:15,720
我猜你会说  找女伴聊以自慰
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}Guessing the short answer is "girls, girls, girls"?

370
00:19:17,020 --> 00:19:18,930
既然你提到这点
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}Well, funny you should mention that.

371
00:19:20,100 --> 00:19:21,690
或许我们可以重新考虑
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}I thought maybe we could rethink

372
00:19:21,690 --> 00:19:23,680
是否仍想继续进行开放式婚姻
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}the whole open marriage thing.

373
00:19:24,860 --> 00:19:25,610
-真的吗  -是啊
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}- Really? - Yeah.

374
00:19:25,610 --> 00:19:27,240
我们应该多花点时间在彼此身上
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}You know, we should focus on us for a while.

375
00:19:27,240 --> 00:19:28,360
可以试下婚姻咨询
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}Go to therapy.

376
00:19:28,360 --> 00:19:29,360
三人不欢
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}And three's a crowd.

377
00:19:29,360 --> 00:19:31,770
尤其是在做婚姻咨询时
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}Especially in couples counseling.

378
00:19:31,870 --> 00:19:32,820
好吧
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}Okay.

379
00:19:33,450 --> 00:19:34,620
你不喜欢这个主意吗
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}What, you don't like that idea?

380
00:19:34,620 --> 00:19:35,610
我喜欢  只是...
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}No. It's just...

381
00:19:36,620 --> 00:19:39,580
显然你的性向对你很重要
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}I mean, obviously, your sexuality is really important.

382
00:19:39,580 --> 00:19:42,960
我不想让你被迫舍弃部分自我
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}And... I just don't want you to have to give any part of that up.

383
00:19:42,960 --> 00:19:44,910
是对我确实很重要
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}It is important to me.

384
00:19:45,670 --> 00:19:47,210
但正如我常说的那样
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}But like I've always said,

385
00:19:47,210 --> 00:19:48,920
我只愿与你共度余生
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}my love story is with you.

386
00:19:49,930 --> 00:19:54,000
若把你与几个炮友相比  我总会选择你
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}And I would choose you over a few casual hookups any day of the week.

387
00:19:56,390 --> 00:19:57,920
就只是你和我了吗
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}It would just be you and me?

388
00:19:58,640 --> 00:20:00,340
不再有其他人
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}Forsaking all others?

389
00:20:00,520 --> 00:20:02,100
至死不渝
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}Till death do us part.

390
00:20:07,070 --> 00:20:08,440
我们是不是突然变成保守派了
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}Did we just become Republicans?

391
00:20:08,440 --> 00:20:09,810
好像是的
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}I think we did.

392
00:20:13,070 --> 00:20:14,280
赫克托  你来了
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}Hector, hi.

393
00:20:14,280 --> 00:20:15,320
快请进
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}Come on in.

394
00:20:17,450 --> 00:20:19,290
卡尔在午睡  要不我去把他叫醒
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}Karl is taking a nap. Should I wake him?

395
00:20:19,290 --> 00:20:21,410
不用了  实际上...
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}Uh, no. Actually, uh,

396
00:20:21,420 --> 00:20:22,620
我是来找你的
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}I'm here to see you.

397
00:20:22,630 --> 00:20:24,200
发生了什么事
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}Oh. What's going on?

398
00:20:24,960 --> 00:20:27,840
还记得上周日  我带卡尔去哈罗德的早午餐会吗
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}Remember last Sunday, when I took Karl to that brunch at Harold's?

399
00:20:27,840 --> 00:20:29,920
记得  谢谢你载他过去
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}Yes. Thank you for driving him.

400
00:20:29,920 --> 00:20:32,170
哈罗德今天打给我了
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}So, Harold called me today.

401
00:20:32,380 --> 00:20:35,150
他猜测卡尔从他的药柜里偷了些药片
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}He thinks Karl stole some pills from his medicine cabinet.

402
00:20:35,640 --> 00:20:36,890
哪类药片
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}What kind of pills?

403
00:20:36,890 --> 00:20:38,170
安眠药
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}Sleeping pills.

404
00:20:38,520 --> 00:20:40,190
两周前我们在比利家打桥牌时
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}And the same thing happened two weeks ago

405
00:20:40,190 --> 00:20:42,090
也发生了同样的事
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}when we went to Billy's for bridge.

406
00:20:48,110 --> 00:20:49,230
这样啊
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}I see.

407
00:20:49,570 --> 00:20:51,390
卡尔表面上故作坚强
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}Karl puts on a brave face,

408
00:20:52,570 --> 00:20:54,560
但我知道他内心有多难过
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}but I know how depressed he's been.

409
00:20:56,240 --> 00:20:57,980
我非常担心他
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}And I'm just so worried.

410
00:20:58,410 --> 00:21:00,360
你确实应该告诉我这些事
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}You did the right thing telling me.

411
00:21:00,500 --> 00:21:03,110
萨蒙妮  把这压力丢给你我非常过意不去
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}Simone, I'm so sorry to dump this on you.

412
00:21:04,080 --> 00:21:06,990
但他向来只听得进你的话
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}But you've always been the only one who can get through to him.

413
00:21:08,920 --> 00:21:10,660
我会处理的
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}I will take care of it.

414
00:21:13,550 --> 00:21:14,580
谢谢你
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}Thank you.

415
00:21:16,680 --> 00:21:19,390
你来誊写那封信
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}So, while you copy the letter in your handwriting,

416
00:21:19,390 --> 00:21:21,880
我去楼上帮你打包衣物
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}I'll be upstairs cleaning out your closet.

417
00:21:22,730 --> 00:21:25,010
你说过拉尔夫大概六点四十五分到家  对吗
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}You said Ralph gets home around 6:45?

418
00:21:25,230 --> 00:21:27,110
有时六点半就回来了
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}Sometimes as early as 6:30.

419
00:21:27,110 --> 00:21:30,180
罗伯六点十五分左右到家  现在已经快五点了
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}Rob gets home around 6:15, and it's almost 5:00.

420
00:21:30,480 --> 00:21:31,810
我们得抓紧时间
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}We need to get cracking.

421
00:21:33,280 --> 00:21:34,270
贝丝·安
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}Beth Ann?

422
00:21:35,910 --> 00:21:37,480
当拉尔夫读到这封信时...
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}When Ralph reads this...

423
00:21:38,990 --> 00:21:41,400
他一定会怒不可遏
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}he will absolutely get violent.

424
00:21:41,540 --> 00:21:43,030
希望如此
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}We can only hope.

425
00:21:53,080 --> 00:21:54,750
{\an8}{\fs18\fsp2\fn方正兰亭黑简体\b1\bord0\blur0\shad0\fad(0,0)}亲爱的拉尔夫

426
00:22:00,930 --> 00:22:04,870
{\an8}{\fs18\fsp2\fn方正兰亭黑简体\b1\bord0\blur0\shad0\fad(0,0)}亲爱的拉尔夫  我这段时间

427
00:22:09,200 --> 00:22:10,440
{\an8}{\fs18\fsp2\fn方正兰亭黑简体\b1\bord0\blur0\shad0\fad(0,0)}过得很不快乐

428
00:22:13,190 --> 00:22:17,400
{\an8}{\fs18\fsp2\fn方正兰亭黑简体\b1\bord0\blur0\shad0\fad(0,0)}...离开你

429
00:22:31,870 --> 00:22:37,000
{\an8}{\fs18\fsp2\fn方正兰亭黑简体\b1\bord0\blur0\shad0\fad(0,0)}我爱上了另一个人

430
00:22:48,100 --> 00:22:49,610
我去农贸市场
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}I'm going to the farmers market.

431
00:22:49,820 --> 00:22:51,150
穿这身去吗
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}Wearing that?

432
00:22:51,150 --> 00:22:52,980
虽然我得和一群土气主妇一起购物
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}Well, just because I have to shop with the frumps

433
00:22:52,980 --> 00:22:54,890
但不代表我就得打扮得像她们一样
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}doesn't mean I have to dress like them.

434
00:22:55,110 --> 00:22:56,440
要帮你带点什么吗
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}Can I get you anything?

435
00:22:57,240 --> 00:22:58,860
还真有
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}Oh, yes, actually, um,

436
00:22:58,860 --> 00:23:01,210
我需要一百颗安眠药
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}I could use a hundred sleeping pills

437
00:23:01,210 --> 00:23:03,570
替换你从我梳妆台拿走的那些
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}to replace the ones you took out of my dresser.

438
00:23:04,080 --> 00:23:05,570
你发现了
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}You noticed.

439
00:23:06,210 --> 00:23:07,210
还真快
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}That was fast.

440
00:23:07,210 --> 00:23:09,250
去年你生我的气
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}Yes, last year you were angry with me

441
00:23:09,250 --> 00:23:11,460
因为我没服下足以自杀的药量
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}because I didn't take enough pills to kill myself,

442
00:23:11,460 --> 00:23:13,290
现在你却一颗都不让我吃
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}and now you won't let me have any.

443
00:23:13,670 --> 00:23:16,460
你得选定一种策略并坚持到底啊  亲爱的
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}You need to choose a policy and stick to it, my girl.

444
00:23:16,470 --> 00:23:19,300
我们必须和这疾病作斗争  绝不能屈服
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}We have to fight this disease. We can't give into it.

445
00:23:19,300 --> 00:23:21,030
你真的忘了
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}Have you really forgotten

446
00:23:21,030 --> 00:23:23,840
我上次肺炎发作有多严重了吗
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}how bad my last bout of pneumonia was?

447
00:23:24,680 --> 00:23:27,010
我还以为自己走不出医院了
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}I wasn't sure I was leaving the hospital.

448
00:23:27,350 --> 00:23:29,060
但你康复了  现在好好的
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}But you did, and now you're fine.

449
00:23:29,060 --> 00:23:32,760
亲爱的  我一点都不好
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}Darling, I'm not fine.

450
00:23:34,400 --> 00:23:36,110
如果我的T细胞是人
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}If my T cells were people,

451
00:23:36,110 --> 00:23:37,690
我当时组局打桥牌的人都凑不够
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}I couldn't get up a bridge game,

452
00:23:37,690 --> 00:23:42,520
所以拜托你把药还给我
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}so please, please give me the pills back.

453
00:23:43,700 --> 00:23:45,410
我已经冲下水槽了
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}I already washed them down the sink.

454
00:23:45,410 --> 00:23:48,330
那你只是逼我采取更可怕的方法
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}Well, then, you'll just force me to do something more gruesome.

455
00:23:48,330 --> 00:23:51,250
上吊或一枪爆头
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}So, hang myself or blow my brains out.

456
00:23:51,250 --> 00:23:52,450
你来选
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}You choose.

457
00:23:52,750 --> 00:23:54,750
我发誓  如果你自杀导致破相
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}So help me, if you do anything disfiguring,

458
00:23:54,750 --> 00:23:56,630
我一定会给你办开棺葬礼
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}I will give you an open-casket funeral

459
00:23:56,630 --> 00:23:59,180
不帮你化妆  也不开荧光灯美颜
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}with no makeup and fluorescent lighting.

460
00:24:00,730 --> 00:24:02,020
天啊
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}Dear God,

461
00:24:03,470 --> 00:24:05,710
我娶的是魔鬼本人呢
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}I married the devil herself.

462
00:24:09,650 --> 00:24:12,090
我知道我们不会永远在一起
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}Oh, I know we won't be together always,

463
00:24:12,590 --> 00:24:16,290
但为何要减少我们能共度的时光呢
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}but why subtract even a day we could share?

464
00:24:21,090 --> 00:24:23,450
好吧  好吧
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}Fine. Fine.

465
00:24:24,690 --> 00:24:25,830
你赢了
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}You win.

466
00:24:29,690 --> 00:24:33,250
其实我下午要去参加一个生日派对
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}Actually, um, I'm going to a birthday party this afternoon.

467
00:24:33,250 --> 00:24:34,320
或许你可以陪我去
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}Maybe you'd like to join me.

468
00:24:34,320 --> 00:24:35,740
是吉米·洛夫特斯生日
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}It's for Jimmy Loftus.

469
00:24:35,770 --> 00:24:38,370
我很想再见到他  他总能逗我开心
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}Oh, I'd love to see him again. He's always a hoot.

470
00:24:38,370 --> 00:24:39,540
他还好吗
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}How is he doing?

471
00:24:39,900 --> 00:24:41,500
恐怕不太好
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}Well, I'm afraid he's had a bit of a setback.

472
00:24:41,500 --> 00:24:42,860
他住院了
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}He's in the hospital.

473
00:24:43,310 --> 00:24:44,060
不
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}Oh, no.

474
00:24:44,060 --> 00:24:45,790
派对在他病房里举行
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}Yes, the party's in his room.

475
00:24:46,710 --> 00:24:48,980
你要是能去  一定会帮他振作精神
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}If you come, I'm sure it would lift his spirits.

476
00:24:50,170 --> 00:24:51,470
我很想去
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}I'd love to come.

477
00:24:52,160 --> 00:24:53,900
我很开心
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}I'm so glad.

478
00:25:00,280 --> 00:25:01,840
谢天谢地
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}Oh, thank God.

479
00:25:04,870 --> 00:25:06,060
-好了  -亲爱的
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}- All right. - Honey...

480
00:25:06,060 --> 00:25:07,200
过来抱下
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}Come here, you.

481
00:25:10,400 --> 00:25:10,990
我的肋骨
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}my ribs.

482
00:25:10,990 --> 00:25:12,220
-抱歉  -不  没事
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}- I'm sorry. - No, no. No, no.

483
00:25:12,220 --> 00:25:14,380
别停  继续抱  我能受得了
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}Don't stop, don't stop. I can take it.

484
00:25:25,420 --> 00:25:27,610
你不是说洁德离开时把狗也带走了吗
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}I thought you said Jade took the dog when she left.

485
00:25:27,990 --> 00:25:28,980
是的
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}She did.

486
00:25:39,810 --> 00:25:42,240
-你在这里做什么  -做晚饭
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}- What are you doing here? - I'm making dinner.

487
00:25:45,660 --> 00:25:46,640
好吧
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}Okay.

488
00:25:48,890 --> 00:25:50,500
你得立刻离开
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}I think you need to leave.

489
00:25:50,500 --> 00:25:52,920
我知道之前闹得有点不愉快
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}I know things got a little funky for a minute there,

490
00:25:52,930 --> 00:25:54,680
但我们没理由不可以
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}but there's no reason that we can't go back

491
00:25:54,680 --> 00:25:55,910
回到从前那样
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}to the way we were before.

492
00:25:55,910 --> 00:25:57,810
有很多理由不可以
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}Oh, I think there are a lot of reasons.

493
00:25:57,810 --> 00:25:59,900
-是的  洁德  请你...  -她不叫洁德
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}- Yeah, Jade, please... - Her name's not Jade.

494
00:25:59,900 --> 00:26:01,170
谁在乎啊
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}Who cares?

495
00:26:01,310 --> 00:26:03,330
我就不能重塑自我吗
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}Am I not allowed to reinvent myself?

496
00:26:03,340 --> 00:26:05,030
我操
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}I mean, fuck.

497
00:26:06,690 --> 00:26:09,780
听我说  我们都先冷静下来
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}Okay, you know what, let's just all settle down.

498
00:26:09,780 --> 00:26:14,590
你们表现得好像一切都是我的错  不是的
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}You guys act like everything that happened is my fault; it's not.

499
00:26:14,590 --> 00:26:15,870
我本来可以去欧洲的
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}I could have gone to Europe,

500
00:26:15,870 --> 00:26:18,130
但你求我留下来
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}but you begged me to stay.

501
00:26:18,310 --> 00:26:20,050
你假装爱我
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}You pretended to love me,

502
00:26:20,050 --> 00:26:23,890
而你答应你会永远照顾我
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}and you promised that you would always take care of me.

503
00:26:24,820 --> 00:26:26,580
这不公平
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}It's not fair.

504
00:26:28,960 --> 00:26:29,820
你说得对
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}You're right.

505
00:26:30,320 --> 00:26:31,600
你说得对  这不公平
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}You're right, it's not fair.

506
00:26:32,100 --> 00:26:33,610
好了  别说了
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}Okay, just stop.

507
00:26:34,720 --> 00:26:36,830
你说的话我一个字都不信
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}I don't believe one thing about you.

508
00:26:36,970 --> 00:26:38,500
更别说你的眼泪了
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}Least of all your tears.

509
00:26:38,860 --> 00:26:40,590
我没假装爱你  我是真的爱你
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}I didn't pretend to love you, I did.

510
00:26:40,590 --> 00:26:42,900
但那是因为我不知道你的真面目
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}But that's because I didn't know who you really are.

511
00:26:42,900 --> 00:26:44,320
你试图骗我们
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}You tried to trick us.

512
00:26:44,700 --> 00:26:46,510
你玩弄了我们  但是你输了
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}You played us, and you lost.

513
00:26:46,790 --> 00:26:47,840
都结束了
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}It's done.

514
00:26:48,490 --> 00:26:49,730
现在滚吧
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}Now get out.

515
00:26:52,190 --> 00:26:53,150
我会走的...
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}I'll go...

516
00:26:55,150 --> 00:26:57,280
但你先得给我钱
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}but you have to pay me first.

517
00:26:57,470 --> 00:26:58,940
你觉得你能敲诈我们
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}You think you can shake us down?

518
00:26:58,940 --> 00:27:01,330
-宝贝  -重新开始是需要钱的
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}- Honey. - It costs money to start over.

519
00:27:01,330 --> 00:27:02,990
我们不会帮助和教唆罪犯的
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}We're not aiding and abetting a criminal.

520
00:27:02,990 --> 00:27:04,120
是你们欠我的
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}You owe me.

521
00:27:04,390 --> 00:27:07,070
伊莱的稿子买了一百万美元
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}Eli sold our script for a million dollars.

522
00:27:07,070 --> 00:27:08,780
给我一万  我就走
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}Give me ten grand, and I'll go.

523
00:27:08,780 --> 00:27:11,680
我不会给你钱让你走的  我会直接报警
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}I'm not gonna pay you to leave. I'm just gonna call the cops.

524
00:27:16,750 --> 00:27:18,820
这样吧  我们冷静一下
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}All right, you know what, let's just hold on a second.

525
00:27:18,830 --> 00:27:19,810
好吗  你知道我接下来要干什么吗
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}Okay? You know what I'm gonna do?

526
00:27:19,810 --> 00:27:21,750
我会跟她谈谈  我们会解决这个问题的
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}I'm gonna go talk to her. We're gonna work this out.

527
00:27:21,750 --> 00:27:23,620
我觉得虽然你经历了这么多
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}I mean, after all, you've been through a lot,

528
00:27:23,620 --> 00:27:24,920
但你不是个坏人
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}but you're not a bad person.

529
00:27:24,920 --> 00:27:26,640
是吧  不是的吧  好的
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}Right? No, no, okay.

530
00:27:26,890 --> 00:27:27,500
你怎么能让我一个人
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}How could you leave me alone

531
00:27:27,500 --> 00:27:28,280
面对那个神经病
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}with that psychopath?

532
00:27:28,290 --> 00:27:30,140
我找不到我的手机了
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}I can't find my fucking phone.

533
00:27:30,250 --> 00:27:31,280
放在哪里了
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}Where is it?

534
00:27:33,890 --> 00:27:34,880
烟雾报警器
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}Smoke alarm.

535
00:27:35,250 --> 00:27:37,380
她要烧了房子
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}She's burning down the goddamn house.

536
00:27:52,350 --> 00:27:54,720
所以吉米预计还能活多久
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}So what, exactly, is Jimmy's prognosis?

537
00:27:54,720 --> 00:27:56,630
不管怎么样  这是场派对
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}Well, whatever it is, this is a party,

538
00:27:56,630 --> 00:27:58,370
所以你要努力微笑
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}so please try to smile.

539
00:27:58,370 --> 00:28:00,380
亲爱的  我能笑着面对一切
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}Darling, I can smile through anything.

540
00:28:04,010 --> 00:28:05,790
卡尔  萨蒙妮 你们来了
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}Karl, Simone, you made it.

541
00:28:05,790 --> 00:28:07,650
你好  让我们过去
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}Hello, hello. Oh, let us through,

542
00:28:07,650 --> 00:28:09,150
我们想看看小寿星
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}we want to see the birthday boy.

543
00:28:11,770 --> 00:28:12,700
{\an8}{\fs18\fsp2\fn方正兰亭黑简体\b1\bord0\blur0\shad0\fad(0,0)}生日快乐

544
00:28:15,790 --> 00:28:17,200
吉米  看看是谁来了
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}Jimmy, look who's here.

545
00:28:17,540 --> 00:28:18,980
是卡尔和萨蒙妮
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}It's Karl and Simone.

546
00:28:19,550 --> 00:28:20,750
生日快乐  吉米
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}Happy birthday, Jimmy.

547
00:28:20,750 --> 00:28:23,090
你该看看萨蒙妮穿着什么
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}And you should see what Simone is wearing.

548
00:28:23,090 --> 00:28:24,570
我觉得是老佛爷
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}I think it's Lagerfeld.

549
00:28:25,600 --> 00:28:26,530
卡尔  萨蒙妮
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}Karl, Simone,

550
00:28:26,530 --> 00:28:29,990
我想给你们介绍一下吉米的妈妈和他的姐姐泰蕊
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}I wanted you to meet Jimmy's mom and his sister Terry.

551
00:28:29,990 --> 00:28:31,180
她们刚刚从爱荷华州赶来
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}They just got in from Iowa.

552
00:28:31,180 --> 00:28:32,930
很高兴认识你们
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}It is so lovely to meet you both.

553
00:28:32,930 --> 00:28:34,600
看到吉米身边有这么一群有爱的朋友
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}I can't tell you how comforting it's been

554
00:28:34,600 --> 00:28:38,180
别提我有多欣慰了
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}to find Jimmy here surrounded by such loving friends.

555
00:28:38,180 --> 00:28:39,960
你还没有完全见识到呢  亲爱的
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}Oh, you ain't seen nothing yet, honey.

556
00:28:39,960 --> 00:28:41,790
我做了我最拿手的胡萝卜蛋糕
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}I made my famous carrot cake.

557
00:28:41,790 --> 00:28:44,210
吉米先生  你一定得来一块
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}You are having a piece, Mr. Jim,

558
00:28:44,210 --> 00:28:47,890
哪怕得把它挤成泥从你的胳膊输进去
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}even if they have to puree it and drip it into your arm.

559
00:28:49,180 --> 00:28:50,740
他能听到我们说话吗
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}Can he hear us?

560
00:28:51,640 --> 00:28:52,650
当然能
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}Of course he can.

561
00:28:54,010 --> 00:28:56,470
既然大家都到了  那该唱歌了
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}Everyone's here now. Time to sing.

562
00:28:56,760 --> 00:28:57,750
开始
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}Here we go.

563
00:28:59,260 --> 00:29:03,130
*祝你生日快乐*
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}* Happy birthday to you *

564
00:29:03,200 --> 00:29:07,310
*祝你生日快乐*
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}* Happy birthday to you *

565
00:29:07,630 --> 00:29:12,340
*生日快乐  亲爱的吉米*
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}* Happy birthday, dear Jimmy *

566
00:29:13,750 --> 00:29:17,800
*祝你生日快乐*
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}*Happy birthday to you*

567
00:29:39,660 --> 00:29:43,610
我不明白他怎么能恶化得这么快
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}I don't understand how he got so sick so quickly.

568
00:29:44,170 --> 00:29:45,700
这病就是这样的
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}This is the disease.

569
00:29:48,100 --> 00:29:51,530
我看着它发生在克莱夫  哈利
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}I've watched it happen to Clive, to Harry,

570
00:29:51,530 --> 00:29:53,740
阿里斯特的身上...
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}to Alistair...

571
00:29:53,740 --> 00:29:55,940
这真的很可怕
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}It's just horrifying.

572
00:29:58,540 --> 00:29:59,690
你知道吗  之前吉米告诉我
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}You know, Jimmy once told me

573
00:29:59,690 --> 00:30:01,820
他很害怕就这样结束一生
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}he was scared of ending up like this.

574
00:30:03,400 --> 00:30:06,750
全身插满管子  耗着等死
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}Connected to tubes, wasting away.

575
00:30:10,060 --> 00:30:11,840
但是现在他还是变成了这样
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}But here he is.

576
00:30:16,270 --> 00:30:17,830
你知道我之后会也会这样的
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}You know what I'm driving at.

577
00:30:17,830 --> 00:30:19,190
你病得没那么厉害
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}You're not that sick.

578
00:30:19,190 --> 00:30:20,230
迟早会的
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}Yet.

579
00:30:23,740 --> 00:30:25,850
但我们已经能看到我的未来了
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}But we've seen my future.

580
00:30:30,340 --> 00:30:32,370
我很想选择继续活着
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}I would rather choose life,

581
00:30:32,370 --> 00:30:35,610
但活着...
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}but life is...

582
00:30:37,590 --> 00:30:38,870
已经选不了了
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}...off the table.

583
00:30:42,120 --> 00:30:43,500
我唯一能选的就是
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}The only thing I can choose is

584
00:30:43,500 --> 00:30:46,110
什么时候死去...
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}when to die and...

585
00:30:48,160 --> 00:30:49,050
以及怎么死去
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}how.

586
00:30:51,530 --> 00:30:52,420
我今天带你来这里
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}I brought you here today

587
00:30:52,430 --> 00:30:54,750
是因为我需要你能理解
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}because I needed you to understand.

588
00:30:58,030 --> 00:30:58,910
你能吗
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}Do you?

589
00:31:12,130 --> 00:31:13,090
谢谢你
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}Thank you.

590
00:31:27,580 --> 00:31:28,430
罗伯
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}Rob.

591
00:31:29,860 --> 00:31:30,770
你回来了
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}You're home.

592
00:31:31,170 --> 00:31:33,540
而且很饿  晚饭做好了吗
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}And starving. Is dinner ready?

593
00:31:33,830 --> 00:31:35,410
今天太忙了
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}The day got away from me.

594
00:31:35,730 --> 00:31:37,550
我只能点了中餐外卖
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}I had to order Chinese takeout.

595
00:31:38,750 --> 00:31:40,400
但今天是周四
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}But it's Thursday.

596
00:31:40,590 --> 00:31:42,530
我本来很期待烘肉卷的
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}I was looking forward to meatloaf.

597
00:31:42,760 --> 00:31:45,490
我给你调了马天尼  但愿能让你开心点
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}If it helps, I made you a shaker of martinis.

598
00:31:45,880 --> 00:31:47,610
等外卖的时候你可以喝几杯
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}You could have a few while we wait.

599
00:31:48,070 --> 00:31:49,290
这还差不多
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}Now you're talkin'.

600
00:31:51,160 --> 00:31:52,100
谢了
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}Thanks.

601
00:32:09,510 --> 00:32:10,720
你是泰勒·哈丁吗
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}Are you Taylor Harding?

602
00:32:10,720 --> 00:32:13,560
是的  你们来得好快  进来吧
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}Yeah. Wow, you got here fast. Come on in.

603
00:32:13,580 --> 00:32:15,510
伊莱  警察来了
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}Eli, the police are here.

604
00:32:16,060 --> 00:32:16,890
这么快
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}Already?

605
00:32:18,920 --> 00:32:21,200
不好意思  你们在等我们吗
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}I'm sorry, were you expecting us?

606
00:32:21,200 --> 00:32:22,730
是的  我们报警有人非法闯入
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}Yeah, we reported a break-in.

607
00:32:23,350 --> 00:32:24,690
十分钟前刚报的警
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}That was, like, ten minutes ago.

608
00:32:24,960 --> 00:32:26,850
我们不是为非法闯入而来的
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}We're not here about any break-in.

609
00:32:27,040 --> 00:32:29,240
我们是来谈杜克·莱利的
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}We came to talk about Duke Riley.

610
00:32:29,950 --> 00:32:30,920
杜克怎么了
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}What about Duke?

611
00:32:30,920 --> 00:32:32,780
六周前你向警方报案
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}You filed a police report six weeks ago

612
00:32:32,780 --> 00:32:34,040
指控他袭击
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}accusing him of assault.

613
00:32:34,040 --> 00:32:36,310
-是的  -然后四天前
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}- Yes. - And then four days ago,

614
00:32:36,310 --> 00:32:37,710
你交了他的保释金
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}you posted his bail.

615
00:32:37,890 --> 00:32:39,610
是的  为什么问这个
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}I did. Why are you asking?

616
00:32:39,680 --> 00:32:41,670
杜克·莱利昨天被杀害了
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}Duke Riley was murdered yesterday.

617
00:32:42,150 --> 00:32:44,770
他的房东在公寓里发现了他的尸体
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}His landlord found his body in his apartment.

618
00:32:44,780 --> 00:32:47,250
他身上有多处刺伤
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}He had been repeatedly stabbed.

619
00:32:49,100 --> 00:32:51,000
你知道可能是谁干的吗
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}Do you have any idea who might have done this?

620
00:32:53,650 --> 00:32:55,170
大概知道
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}I think we do.

621
00:32:58,920 --> 00:33:01,530
这是我的第三杯了
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}Whoa, this'll be my third one.

622
00:33:01,540 --> 00:33:03,120
谁在数呢
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}Oh, who's counting?

623
00:33:05,510 --> 00:33:08,310
斯坦顿夫人  你是想灌醉我吗
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}Mrs. Stanton, are you trying to get me drunk?

624
00:33:08,980 --> 00:33:10,880
我只是想让你放松下来
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}I just wanted you to be relaxed

625
00:33:10,880 --> 00:33:12,670
这样我们就可以聊聊了
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}so we could have a little chat.

626
00:33:14,130 --> 00:33:15,370
聊什么
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}About what?

627
00:33:16,450 --> 00:33:18,260
聊我们女儿死的那天
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}About the day our daughter died.

628
00:33:27,440 --> 00:33:28,530
用这个就行吗
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}This will do it?

629
00:33:28,530 --> 00:33:30,120
是的  一剂就行
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}Yes, just the one dose.

630
00:33:32,100 --> 00:33:36,200
你不会感到任何痛苦  只会...睡过去
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}And you won't feel any pain, you'll just... sleep?

631
00:33:36,330 --> 00:33:37,670
据说是的
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}So I'm told.

632
00:33:39,200 --> 00:33:41,170
你确定不要赫克托来陪你吗
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}Are you sure you don't want Hector here?

633
00:33:41,840 --> 00:33:44,760
不用  我们  我们已经道过别了
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}No, no. We've, um, we've said our goodbyes.

634
00:33:45,250 --> 00:33:46,970
他也想来的  但是
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}I-I mean, he wanted to be here, but...

635
00:33:47,230 --> 00:33:48,860
他太情绪化了
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}well, he's so bloody emotional.

636
00:33:48,860 --> 00:33:52,390
一提到我的死  他就像汽车警报一样嚎啕大哭
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}The mere mention of my death, he starts wailing like a car alarm.

637
00:33:52,770 --> 00:33:55,990
留点口德  他爱你
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}Be nice. He loves you.

638
00:33:57,000 --> 00:33:57,940
我知道
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}I know.

639
00:33:58,960 --> 00:34:00,200
不过说实话
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}But to be honest, uh,

640
00:34:01,220 --> 00:34:03,340
我只想要我们两个人
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}I just wanted it to be the two of us.

641
00:34:04,280 --> 00:34:06,900
你值得比我更多的
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}You deserve to have more than just me.

642
00:34:08,400 --> 00:34:11,710
你应该举办一个盛大的派对来送行
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}You should have a huge, glorious party to send you off.

643
00:34:11,710 --> 00:34:16,490
你就是一个盛大的派对  无需他人
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}You are a glorious party, all by yourself.

644
00:34:19,140 --> 00:34:20,360
第一眼看到你时
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}I knew that the first moment

645
00:34:20,360 --> 00:34:21,970
我就知道了
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}I laid eyes on you.

646
00:34:27,130 --> 00:34:29,280
你永远都是我一生的挚爱
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}You'll always be the love of my life.

647
00:34:35,270 --> 00:34:36,710
接下来怎么办呢
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}So, what happens now?

648
00:34:37,240 --> 00:34:39,280
首先  我
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}Well, uh, firstly, I...

649
00:34:39,990 --> 00:34:42,740
我想让你换上我在威尼斯给你买的
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}I'd like you to change into the red gown

650
00:34:42,740 --> 00:34:44,380
那件红色礼服
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}I bought you in Venice.

651
00:34:45,240 --> 00:34:46,900
这件有什么不好吗
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}What's wrong with this one?

652
00:34:48,280 --> 00:34:49,660
我喜欢红色那件
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}I prefer the red.

653
00:34:51,910 --> 00:34:52,850
好吧
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}All right.

654
00:34:53,230 --> 00:34:56,200
但这是我最后一次让你给我挑衣服了
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}But this is the last time I'll let you edit my wardrobe.

655
00:34:58,020 --> 00:35:00,330
换好衣服后  到客厅来
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}When you've changed, come down to the living room.

656
00:35:01,390 --> 00:35:03,260
我有个惊喜给你
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}I have a nice surprise for you.

657
00:35:07,130 --> 00:35:08,640
我不想聊艾米莉
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}I don't want to talk about Emily.

658
00:35:08,640 --> 00:35:11,980
我想聊  最近我一直在想那天的事
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}Well, I do. I've been thinking about that day a lot lately.

659
00:35:12,310 --> 00:35:13,930
我想起了一件事
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}And I've remembered something.

660
00:35:14,280 --> 00:35:15,200
什么事
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}What's that?

661
00:35:16,450 --> 00:35:19,040
把垃圾桶拖进来后
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}I absolutely locked the gate

662
00:35:19,040 --> 00:35:21,220
我绝对把大门锁上了
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}after I brought in the trash can.

663
00:35:24,100 --> 00:35:25,490
你肯定是没锁
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}Well, you must not have.

664
00:35:26,020 --> 00:35:28,390
不然艾米莉是怎么跑到街上去的
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}How else did Emily get out into the street?

665
00:35:28,570 --> 00:35:31,460
也许你可以想出另一种解释
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}Perhaps you could come up with another explanation.

666
00:35:33,160 --> 00:35:34,140
想想
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}Think.

667
00:35:37,980 --> 00:35:39,280
我感觉不舒服
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}I'm not feeling well.

668
00:35:40,870 --> 00:35:41,830
亲爱的
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}My darling.

669
00:35:42,500 --> 00:35:46,800
你无法想象这一刻对我有多重要
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}You can't possibly imagine how important this moment is to me.

670
00:35:48,190 --> 00:35:49,110
拜托
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}Please.

671
00:35:50,960 --> 00:35:54,810
那天发生了什么你没告诉我的事吗
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}Did anything happen that day you haven't told me?

672
00:36:08,680 --> 00:36:09,540
没有
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}No.

673
00:36:13,900 --> 00:36:14,840
谢谢
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}Thank you.

674
00:36:15,960 --> 00:36:16,930
谢什么
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}For what?

675
00:36:17,650 --> 00:36:19,890
你让这一切变得简单多了
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}You've made this all so much easier.

676
00:36:21,160 --> 00:36:23,090
显然她很危险
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}Well, she's obviously dangerous.

677
00:36:23,280 --> 00:36:25,120
在我们找到她之前  也许你们应该考虑
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}You might want to think about staying someplace

678
00:36:25,120 --> 00:36:27,140
换个地方住几天
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}for a few days until we locate her.

679
00:36:27,140 --> 00:36:28,520
我们今晚就去住酒店
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}We'll check into a hotel tonight.

680
00:36:28,520 --> 00:36:31,010
在你们离开前  我们安排一辆警车在外面守着
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}And we'll put a car on the street outside until you leave.

681
00:36:31,010 --> 00:36:32,870
别担心  我们不会放她进来的
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}Don't worry. She won't get past us.

682
00:36:33,180 --> 00:36:34,860
-晚安  -晚安
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}- Good night. - Night.

683
00:36:37,750 --> 00:36:39,730
好吧  我只想在警探面前保持镇静
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}Okay, I was trying to be cool in front of the detectives,

684
00:36:39,730 --> 00:36:40,730
但是  我的天呐  洁德杀了杜克
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}but oh, my God, Jade killed Duke.

685
00:36:40,730 --> 00:36:41,770
-我知道  我知道  -等下
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}- I know. I know. - Wait,

686
00:36:41,770 --> 00:36:43,080
你觉得她真的会回来吗
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}do you think she's actually gonna come back here?

687
00:36:43,080 --> 00:36:45,020
我们不能坐以待毙
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}We can't stick around long enough to find out.

688
00:36:45,020 --> 00:36:46,690
-那那只狗怎么办  -带它一起走
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}- What about the dog? - We'll take it with us.

689
00:36:46,690 --> 00:36:48,550
你先喂它  我去收拾东西
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}You feed her first, I'll go start packing.

690
00:36:48,630 --> 00:36:51,410
-好  过来  茶杯  -好了
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}- Okay. All right. Come on, Teacup. - Okay.

691
00:37:14,470 --> 00:37:15,680
玛丽  我回来了
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}Mary, I'm home.

692
00:37:19,350 --> 00:37:20,580
给我拿啤酒
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}Bring me a beer!

693
00:37:20,990 --> 00:37:22,820
这次用马克杯装
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}And I want it in a mug this time.

694
00:37:30,730 --> 00:37:31,620
玛丽
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}Mary?

695
00:37:34,900 --> 00:37:35,800
玛丽
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}Mary?

696
00:37:43,250 --> 00:37:46,880
亲爱的拉尔夫  我已经不开心很久了
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}Dearest Ralph. I haven't been happy for quite some time.

697
00:37:46,900 --> 00:37:49,130
但那并非我决定要离开你的原因
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}But that's not why I've decided to leave you.

698
00:37:49,530 --> 00:37:52,960
我遇到了一个人  一个让我感到幸福的男人
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}I've met someone else. A man who makes me happy.

699
00:37:53,540 --> 00:37:55,700
所以我要离开你  投向罗伯·斯坦顿的怀抱
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}So I'm leaving you for Rob Stanton.

700
00:37:55,700 --> 00:37:58,220
你永远都无法像他那样爱我
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}He loves me in a way you never could.

701
00:37:58,220 --> 00:38:00,070
你的前妻  玛丽
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}Your ex-wife, Mary.

702
00:38:09,300 --> 00:38:10,240
妈的
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}Shit.

703
00:38:52,410 --> 00:38:53,710
你不接吗
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}Aren't you gonna get that?

704
00:38:55,510 --> 00:38:57,240
一定是打错了
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}Must have been a wrong number.

705
00:38:58,950 --> 00:39:01,520
中餐什么时候能送到  我饿了
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}Well, when's the Chinese food getting here? I'm hungry.

706
00:39:01,970 --> 00:39:04,770
肯定很快就能到了
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}I'm sure it'll arrive any second.

707
00:39:06,880 --> 00:39:07,710
看见没
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}See?

708
00:39:09,580 --> 00:39:10,460
等下
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}Wait.

709
00:39:10,690 --> 00:39:13,410
你确定是送餐的人吗  他听起来很愤怒
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}Are you sure that's the delivery guy? He sounds angry.

710
00:39:15,010 --> 00:39:16,430
不然还能是谁
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}Who else could it be?

711
00:39:30,700 --> 00:39:32,560
你太美了
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}You are so beautiful.

712
00:39:32,870 --> 00:39:34,210
你也很帅
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}Look who's talking.

713
00:39:38,630 --> 00:39:39,650
你准备好了吗
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}Are you ready?

714
00:39:43,140 --> 00:39:45,560
还没有
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}Not just yet.

715
00:39:46,290 --> 00:39:47,270
你改变主意了吗
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}Have you changed your mind?

716
00:39:47,270 --> 00:39:48,610
没有  没有
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}No. No.

717
00:39:49,920 --> 00:39:53,780
但我想再跳一支舞
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}But I would love just one more dance.

718
00:39:55,620 --> 00:39:56,720
探戈
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}A tango?

719
00:39:57,790 --> 00:39:58,840
还能有什么
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}What else?

720
00:40:02,590 --> 00:40:03,610
宝贝  应该打包什么
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}Babe, what should I pack?

721
00:40:03,610 --> 00:40:05,170
只带必需品
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}Just the essentials.

722
00:40:09,620 --> 00:40:10,920
这个怎么是必需品
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}How is this essential?

723
00:40:10,920 --> 00:40:11,890
虽然我们是去躲起来
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}Look, just 'cause we're going into hiding

724
00:40:11,890 --> 00:40:13,230
不代表我们不能打扮好看点
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}doesn't mean we can't look good.

725
00:40:13,480 --> 00:40:14,320
你看到我的笔记本了吗
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}Hey, have you seen my laptop?

726
00:40:14,320 --> 00:40:16,390
应该在楼下  看看餐厅桌子上有没有
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}I think it's downstairs. Check the dining room table.

727
00:40:16,390 --> 00:40:17,840
-好  我马上回  -好的
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}- Okay, I'll be right back. - All right.

728
00:40:18,070 --> 00:40:19,280
这么说是真的了
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}So it's true.

729
00:40:19,410 --> 00:40:20,380
你来这做什么
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}What are you doing here?

730
00:40:20,380 --> 00:40:21,790
我不会待太久的
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}I won't be here long.

731
00:40:23,500 --> 00:40:24,690
我只想知道为什么
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}I just want to know why.

732
00:40:24,690 --> 00:40:26,660
现在不是时候  你得离开
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}Now is not a good time. You have to go.

733
00:40:26,660 --> 00:40:28,000
搞什么
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}What the hell?

734
00:40:28,000 --> 00:40:29,150
对不起  罗伯
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}I'm sorry, Rob.

735
00:40:32,130 --> 00:40:32,810
亲爱的  这位是
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}Honey, this is...

736
00:40:32,810 --> 00:40:35,020
别撒谎了  她知道我们在搞外遇
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}Don't bother lying. She knows that we were having an affair.

737
00:40:35,020 --> 00:40:36,340
-什么  -求你了
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}- What? - Please.

738
00:40:36,340 --> 00:40:38,500
-你得走了  -你知道我经常跟你提起
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}- You have to go! - You know how I always talk to you

739
00:40:38,500 --> 00:40:40,080
我的朋友希拉
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}about my friend Sheila?

740
00:40:40,730 --> 00:40:41,890
她就是希拉
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}This is Sheila.

741
00:40:44,900 --> 00:40:46,000
好吧
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}Uh, okay...

742
00:40:47,130 --> 00:40:49,620
我那天去餐厅是去找你对质的
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}I came to the diner that day to confront you.

743
00:40:50,510 --> 00:40:53,550
但你人太好了  你说我们可以当朋友
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}But you were so nice. And you said we could be friends.

744
00:40:53,590 --> 00:40:54,350
等下
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}Hold on.

745
00:40:54,350 --> 00:40:56,310
你和我的情妇做了朋友
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}You're friends with my mistress?

746
00:40:56,610 --> 00:40:57,170
是未婚妻
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}Fiancée.

747
00:40:57,170 --> 00:40:58,740
能晚点再说这个吗
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}Can we talk about this later?

748
00:40:58,830 --> 00:41:00,450
你都在想什么呢
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}What could you have been thinking?

749
00:41:00,450 --> 00:41:02,320
你还有脸说话
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}Oh, you're a fine one to talk.

750
00:41:02,320 --> 00:41:04,310
你已经出轨了几个月
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}You've been having an affair for months.

751
00:41:04,320 --> 00:41:05,600
一直在计划离开我
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}You've been planning on leaving me.

752
00:41:05,600 --> 00:41:08,430
天呐  你真的得了癌症吗
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}Oh, my God. Do you even have cancer?

753
00:41:08,430 --> 00:41:11,010
癌症  你得了癌症
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}Cancer? You have cancer?

754
00:41:12,100 --> 00:41:13,550
这真是太尴尬了
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}Well, this is just awkward.

755
00:48:40,050 --> 00:48:41,050
你好
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}Hi there.

756
00:48:41,340 --> 00:48:42,580
你一定就是贝丝·安了
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}You must be Beth Ann?

757
00:48:42,580 --> 00:48:44,360
你一定就是萨蒙妮了  请进
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}You must be Simone. Come in.

758
00:48:44,580 --> 00:48:47,330
-真高兴终于见到你了  -我也是
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}- It's nice to finally meet you. - Likewise.

759
00:48:47,700 --> 00:48:49,440
我把钥匙放在这附近了
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}I have the keys around here somewhere.

760
00:48:49,440 --> 00:48:50,490
我找找
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}Let me look.

761
00:48:52,510 --> 00:48:53,750
我想见你的其中一个原因就是
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}One of the reasons I wanted to meet

762
00:48:53,750 --> 00:48:55,700
我有个疑问
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}was because I had a question.

763
00:48:56,040 --> 00:48:57,510
说起来有点尴尬
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}It's a bit awkward.

764
00:48:58,130 --> 00:48:59,310
你想知道什么
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}What would you like to know?

765
00:48:59,310 --> 00:49:00,310
房产经纪人告诉我
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}The realtor told me

766
00:49:00,310 --> 00:49:02,800
有人在这房子里被谋杀了
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}that someone was murdered in this house?

767
00:49:02,800 --> 00:49:04,900
是真的  我丈夫被杀了
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}It's true. My husband was killed...

768
00:49:05,020 --> 00:49:06,160
就在你现在所在的位置
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}right where you're standing.

769
00:49:06,170 --> 00:49:07,970
-天呐  -我们的邻居闯进来
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}- Oh, dear. - Our neighbor broke in

770
00:49:07,980 --> 00:49:10,020
指责罗伯睡了他老婆
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}and accused Rob of sleeping with his wife.

771
00:49:10,020 --> 00:49:11,150
开枪把他打死
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}Shot him dead.

772
00:49:11,180 --> 00:49:13,590
去年被处决了  真可惜
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}He was executed last year. So sad.

773
00:49:15,270 --> 00:49:17,210
贝丝阿姨  我收拾好了  能走了吗
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}Aunt Beth, I'm packed. Can we go?

774
00:49:17,230 --> 00:49:19,210
马上  艾尔西  这是萨蒙妮
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}In a sec. Elsie, this is Simone,

775
00:49:19,210 --> 00:49:21,320
-买了我们房子的女士  -你好
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}- the woman who bought our house. - Hi, there.

776
00:49:21,330 --> 00:49:23,850
你真漂亮  她是你侄女吗
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}You're so pretty. She's your niece?

777
00:49:24,040 --> 00:49:26,110
我朋友艾普尔·华纳的女儿
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}The daughter of my friend, April Warner.

778
00:49:26,110 --> 00:49:28,490
但我从她出生起就开始帮忙照顾她了
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}But I've been helping take care of her since she was a baby.

779
00:49:29,200 --> 00:49:30,650
艾普尔是歌手  你懂的
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}April is a singer, you know.

780
00:49:30,650 --> 00:49:31,960
我妈妈会上百老汇
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}My mom's gonna be on Broadway.

781
00:49:31,960 --> 00:49:34,180
所以我们才卖掉房子  我们要搬去纽约
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}That's why we sold the house. We're moving to New York.

782
00:49:34,180 --> 00:49:35,670
真令人激动
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}Oh, how exciting.

783
00:49:35,740 --> 00:49:37,000
这是你的钥匙
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}Here are your keys.

784
00:49:38,070 --> 00:49:40,600
希望我能在这里过得幸福
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}I hope to have a very happy life in this house.

785
00:49:41,100 --> 00:49:42,980
幸福生活并不难遇到
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}A happy life isn't hard to come by.

786
00:49:43,770 --> 00:49:46,680
关键在于不要后悔
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}The trick is to not regret the choices

787
00:49:46,680 --> 00:49:48,280
你在一路上所作出的选择
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}you made along the way.

788
00:49:50,080 --> 00:49:51,050
是的
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}Yes.

789
00:49:51,630 --> 00:49:52,520
那...
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}Well...

790
00:49:53,520 --> 00:49:55,010
祝你一切顺利
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}good luck with everything.

791
00:49:55,500 --> 00:49:57,990
你也是  照顾好我的房子
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}Likewise. Take care of my house.

792
00:49:59,190 --> 00:50:00,840
我会好好爱护它的
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}I'll give it lots of love.

793
00:50:03,100 --> 00:50:04,250
给
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}There you go.

794
00:50:05,590 --> 00:50:06,450
谢谢
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}Thank you.

795
00:50:07,190 --> 00:50:09,110
我相信我们会爱上这里的
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}I just know that we're gonna love living here.

796
00:50:09,240 --> 00:50:10,860
我希望如此
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}I certainly hope so.

797
00:50:11,060 --> 00:50:12,770
所以你是什么时候买下这里的
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}So when did you buy the house?

798
00:50:12,810 --> 00:50:13,910
74年
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}'74.

799
00:50:14,170 --> 00:50:17,120
但我丈夫去世后  我就把房子租出去了
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}But after my husband died, I rented the house out.

800
00:50:17,320 --> 00:50:20,260
然后又成了我基金会的总部
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}Then it was the headquarters for my foundation.

801
00:50:20,990 --> 00:50:23,030
我为艾滋病研究募集资金
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}I raise money for AIDS research.

802
00:50:23,030 --> 00:50:24,230
我们看过你的报道
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}Yeah, we've read up on you.

803
00:50:24,230 --> 00:50:26,090
你做出了很多贡献
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}You've done such amazing work.

804
00:50:26,090 --> 00:50:28,660
在我不再担心钱后
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}I ended up living a very rich life,

805
00:50:28,770 --> 00:50:30,770
我过上了富裕[丰富多彩]的生活
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}once I stopped worrying about money.

806
00:50:32,680 --> 00:50:33,980
保罗  我准备好了
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}Paulo, I'm ready.

807
00:50:35,830 --> 00:50:37,500
那是汤马斯·J·哈特的作品吗
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}Is that a Thomas J. Harte?

808
00:50:37,560 --> 00:50:40,080
-你知道他的作品  -当然
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}- Oh, you know his work? - Sure.

809
00:50:40,080 --> 00:50:41,430
我们去年
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}Yeah, we saw a show of his

810
00:50:41,430 --> 00:50:43,360
-在惠特尼美国艺术博物馆看了他的画展  -是的
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}- at the Whitney last year. - That's right, yeah.

811
00:50:43,360 --> 00:50:45,460
真好
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}Oh, isn't that wonderful?

812
00:50:45,850 --> 00:50:48,000
我一直希望汤米能飞黄腾达
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}I always hoped Tommy would go far.

813
00:50:48,080 --> 00:50:51,090
汤米  他是你朋友吗
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}Tommy? Is he a friend of yours?

814
00:50:51,640 --> 00:50:54,610
朋友  也可以这么说
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}A friend? You could say that.

815
00:50:55,960 --> 00:50:58,540
他屁股上文了我的脸
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}My face is tattooed on his ass.

816
00:51:01,720 --> 00:51:03,070
保罗  推车
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}Paulo, push.

817
00:51:08,640 --> 00:51:11,130

{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}Aw, well, I hope you'll enjoy it.

821

我们会的
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}We will.

822
00:51:19,530 --> 00:51:23,240
我很遗憾你们在这儿的遭遇
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}And I'm sorry for everything that happened to you here.

823
00:51:23,420 --> 00:51:25,890
不敢想象你们经历了什么
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}Can't imagine what you went through.

824
00:51:26,190 --> 00:51:27,610
那是可怕的一晚
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}It was an awful night.

825
00:51:28,220 --> 00:51:29,640
但本可能更糟的
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}But it could have been worse.

826
00:51:30,350 --> 00:51:31,890
你真的有收藏来复枪
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}So you really have a rifle collection?

827
00:51:31,890 --> 00:51:34,230
是的  全都在那个箱子里
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}Yeah. They're all in that box over there.

828
00:51:34,240 --> 00:51:35,410
看看
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}Hey, check this out.

829
00:51:36,850 --> 00:51:40,230
这是我在非洲狩猎
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}This is me on safari in Africa.

830
00:51:40,230 --> 00:51:41,790
-瞧瞧  -不是吧
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}- Look at that. - No way.

831
00:51:42,090 --> 00:51:44,960
我都不知道有喜欢打猎的犹太人
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}Well, I-I never knew there were Jews that were into hunting.

832
00:51:44,960 --> 00:51:47,090
有的  但对动物来说没那么残忍
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}We exist. But it's not as cruel to the animals,

833
00:51:47,090 --> 00:51:48,690
因为我们经常射偏
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}because we miss so frequently.

834
00:51:50,440 --> 00:51:53,110
趁我还没忘
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}Oh, before I forget,

835
00:51:53,700 --> 00:51:54,730
这是你们的钥匙
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}here are your keys.

836
00:51:54,730 --> 00:51:55,740
谢谢
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}Thank you.

837
00:51:57,370 --> 00:51:58,790
你们俩有何打算呢
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}So, what about the two of you?

838
00:51:58,790 --> 00:52:00,060
找到新的住所了吗
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}Found a new place to live?

839
00:52:00,500 --> 00:52:01,720
嗯  实际上...
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}Uh, yeah. Well, actually...

840
00:52:01,720 --> 00:52:03,840
我们准备搬回我们以前的公寓
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}...we're moving back to our old condo.

841
00:52:04,390 --> 00:52:07,450
在豪宅里生活过后  这可是大退步啊
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}After living in a mansion. That is some serious downsizing.

842
00:52:07,920 --> 00:52:10,010
对我们来说  其实...
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}Yeah. For us, it turns out...

843
00:52:10,010 --> 00:52:11,280
少即是多
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}Less is more.

844
00:52:12,100 --> 00:52:13,700
祝你们好运
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}Well, best of luck to both of you.

845
00:52:13,710 --> 00:52:15,230
-谢谢  -谢谢
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}- Thanks. - Thanks.

846
00:52:18,770 --> 00:52:20,320
他们看上去人不错
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}They seem like nice people.

847
00:52:22,660 --> 00:52:26,540
{\an8}{\fs18\fsp2\fn方正兰亭黑简体\b1\bord0\blur0\shad0\fad(0,0)}昨晚谢谢你

你会想念这房子吗
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}Are you gonna miss the house?

849
00:52:30,480 --> 00:52:31,670
就是栋建筑物而已
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}It's just a building.

850
00:52:32,160 --> 00:52:33,860
居所才是我家所在的地方
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}Home is where my family is.

851
00:52:35,900 --> 00:52:40,940

{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}Yes. I'm ready for my massage now.
