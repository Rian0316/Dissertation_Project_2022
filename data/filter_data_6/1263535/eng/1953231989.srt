1
00:01:13,323 --> 00:01:16,535
(LIZZY): <i>You are the last man
whom I could ever marry!</i>


2
00:01:16,618 --> 00:01:19,246
<i>Do you think any consideration
would tempt me?</i>


3
00:01:19,329 --> 00:01:21,248
<i>Your arrogance, your conceit,</i>


4
00:01:21,331 --> 00:01:24,168
<i>and your selfish disdain
for the feelings of others!</i>


5
00:01:24,251 --> 00:01:26,420
<i>My opinion of you was
decided when I heard</i>


6
00:01:26,503 --> 00:01:29,423
<i>Mr Wickham 's story
of your dealings with him.</i>


7
00:01:29,506 --> 00:01:32,676
Well at least in that I
may defend myself.


8
00:01:33,302 --> 00:01:37,347
(DARCY): <i>Could you expect me to rejoice
in the inferiority of your connections?</i>


9
00:01:37,431 --> 00:01:39,641
<i>To congratulate myself
on the hope of relations</i>


10
00:01:39,725 --> 00:01:42,853
<i>whose conditions in life
is so below my own?</i>


11
00:01:44,313 --> 00:01:46,231
(LIZZY): <i>You are mistaken, Mr Darcy.</i>


12
00:01:46,690 --> 00:01:49,234
<i>Your declaration merely spared me the</i>


13
00:01:49,318 --> 00:01:51,528
<i>concern I might have
felt in refusing you,</i>


14
00:01:51,612 --> 00:01:54,698
<i>had you behaved in a more
gentleman-like manner.</i>


15
00:01:55,157 --> 00:01:57,993
(LADY CATHERINE): Who's
there, Fitzwilliam?


16
00:01:58,076 --> 00:02:01,997
- Darcy! We' d quite despaired of you!
- (LADY CATHERINE): Is that my nephew?


17
00:02:02,122 --> 00:02:06,585
(LADY CATHERINE): Where have you been?
Let him come in and explain himself!


18
00:02:06,668 --> 00:02:08,879
No. You will forgive me.


19
00:02:10,547 --> 00:02:12,674
You'Il forgive me.


20
00:02:12,758 --> 00:02:14,885
Darcy, you are unwell?


21
00:02:14,968 --> 00:02:18,055
I'm very well, thank you, but I have a
pressing matter of business.


22
00:02:18,639 --> 00:02:19,640
You'Il forgive me.


23
00:02:20,140 --> 00:02:23,352
Make my apologies to
Lady Catherine, Fitzwilliam.


24
00:02:49,127 --> 00:02:51,129
<i>To Miss Elizabeth Bennet.</i>


25
00:02:57,469 --> 00:03:00,264
<i>Be not alarmed, madam,
on receiving this letter,</i>


26
00:03:00,347 --> 00:03:02,683
<i>that it contains any repetition
of those sentiments</i>


27
00:03:02,683 --> 00:03:07,187
<i>or offers which were this
evening so disgusting to you.</i>


28
00:03:15,612 --> 00:03:19,783
<i>But I must be allowed to defend myself
against the charges laid at my door.</i>


29
00:03:19,867 --> 00:03:22,202
<i>In particular those
relating to Mr Wickham,</i>


30
00:03:22,286 --> 00:03:25,205
<i>which if true, would indeed be grievous,</i>


31
00:03:25,289 --> 00:03:28,166
<i>but are wholly without foundation,
and which I can only refute</i>


32
00:03:28,250 --> 00:03:31,503
<i>by laying before you
his connection with my family.</i>


33
00:03:35,257 --> 00:03:38,302
<i>Mr Wickham is the son
of a very respectable man,</i>


34
00:03:38,385 --> 00:03:41,471
<i>who had the management of our estates.</i>


35
00:03:41,555 --> 00:03:45,475
<i>My own father was fond of him
and held him in high esteem.</i>


36
00:03:50,606 --> 00:03:52,691
<i>We played together as boys.</i>


37
00:03:56,945 --> 00:03:59,656
<i>After his father's early death,
my father supported him at school</i>


38
00:03:59,740 --> 00:04:05,037
<i>and at Cambridge, and hoped
he would make the church his profession.</i>


39
00:04:08,332 --> 00:04:10,667
<i>But by then George Wickham 's
habits were as dissolute</i>


40
00:04:10,751 --> 00:04:13,920
<i>as his manners were engaging.</i>


41
00:04:21,470 --> 00:04:24,389
<i>My own excellent
father died five years ago.</i>


42
00:04:25,390 --> 00:04:28,810
<i>His attachment to Mr Wickham
was to the last so steady,</i>


43
00:04:28,894 --> 00:04:30,937
<i>that he desired that a
valuable family living</i>


44
00:04:31,021 --> 00:04:32,939
<i>might be his as soon as it was vacant.</i>


45
00:04:33,023 --> 00:04:36,610
<i>Mr Wickham declined any
interest in the church as a career,</i>


46
00:04:36,693 --> 00:04:38,362
<i>but requested, and was granted,</i>


47
00:04:38,445 --> 00:04:41,365
<i>the sum of 3, 000 pounds
instead of the living.</i>


48
00:04:45,869 --> 00:04:48,955
<i>He expressed an intention
of studying the law.</i>


49
00:04:49,039 --> 00:04:52,209
<i>I wished, rather than
believed him to be sincere.</i>


50
00:04:54,670 --> 00:04:56,171
Thank you.


51
00:04:59,341 --> 00:05:01,718
I'm most exceedingly obliged.


52
00:05:03,720 --> 00:05:06,890
<i>All connection between us
seemed now dissolved.</i>


53
00:05:10,102 --> 00:05:11,436
Georgiana.


54
00:05:16,858 --> 00:05:19,820
<i>Being now free from all restraint,</i>


55
00:05:19,903 --> 00:05:22,948
<i>his life was one of
idleness and dissipation.</i>


56
00:05:25,450 --> 00:05:27,577
<i>How he lived, I know not.</i>


57
00:05:28,203 --> 00:05:32,916
<i>But last summer our paths crossed again,
under the most painful circumstances,</i>


58
00:05:33,208 --> 00:05:35,961
<i>which I myself would wish to forget.</i>


59
00:05:36,837 --> 00:05:40,924
<i>My sister, Georgiana,
who is more than ten years my junior,</i>


60
00:05:41,258 --> 00:05:45,178
<i>was left to the guardianship
of Colonel Fitzwilliam and myself.</i>


61
00:05:46,763 --> 00:05:50,434
<i>About a year ago, she was taken
from school to Ramsgate,</i>


62
00:05:50,934 --> 00:05:53,895
<i>and placed in the care of a Mrs Younge,</i>


63
00:05:53,979 --> 00:05:56,356
<i>in whose character we were
most unhappily deceived.</i>


64
00:05:57,441 --> 00:06:01,403
<i>And thither also went Mr Wickham,
undoubtedly by design.</i>


65
00:06:03,822 --> 00:06:08,493
<i>She was persuaded to believe herself in
love, and to consent to an elopement.</i>


66
00:06:08,785 --> 00:06:11,747
<i>She was then but fifteen years old.</i>


67
00:06:15,751 --> 00:06:20,005
<i>A day or two before the intended
elopement, I joined them unexpectedly.</i>


68
00:06:35,187 --> 00:06:37,814
<i>Unable to support the
idea of grieving a brother</i>


69
00:06:37,898 --> 00:06:40,275
<i>whom she looked up
to almost as a father,</i>


70
00:06:40,358 --> 00:06:43,361
<i>she acknowledged the whole
plan to me at once.</i>


71
00:06:43,570 --> 00:06:46,490
<i>You may imagine what I felt
and how I acted.</i>


72
00:06:48,158 --> 00:06:50,869
<i>Mr Wickham left the place immediately.</i>


73
00:06:55,916 --> 00:06:57,459
(DARCY): Come.


74
00:07:03,423 --> 00:07:05,425
<i>Mr Wickham relinquished his object,</i>


75
00:07:05,509 --> 00:07:08,804
<i>which was of course, my sister's
fortune of 30,000.</i>


76
00:07:10,013 --> 00:07:13,725
<i>A secondary motive must have been
to revenge himself on me.</i>


77
00:07:14,101 --> 00:07:18,188
<i>Had he succeeded, his revenge would
have been complete indeed.</i>


78
00:07:18,396 --> 00:07:24,194
<i>This, madam, is a faithful narrative
of all my dealings with Mr Wickham.</i>


79
00:08:14,369 --> 00:08:17,998
You do look pale, Lizzy.
Why don't you have some breakfast?


80
00:08:18,081 --> 00:08:19,624
I'm sure it will do you good.


81
00:08:19,708 --> 00:08:21,585
I am well, Charlotte.


82
00:08:22,043 --> 00:08:25,547
I've stayed indoors too long.
Fresh air and exercise is all I need.


83
00:08:25,630 --> 00:08:29,551
The woods around Rosings are
so beautiful at this time of year.


84
00:09:15,222 --> 00:09:16,640
Miss Bennet!


85
00:09:19,142 --> 00:09:20,393
Mr Darcy.


86
00:09:20,936 --> 00:09:24,940
I've been walking the grove some time
in the hope of meeting you.


87
00:09:25,065 --> 00:09:28,276
Will you do me the honour
of reading this letter ?


88
00:09:44,668 --> 00:09:46,670
(DARCY): <i>This, madam, is a faithful</i>


89
00:09:46,753 --> 00:09:48,880
<i>narrative of my
dealings with Mr Wickham,</i>


90
00:09:48,964 --> 00:09:52,884
<i>and for its truth I can appeal to the
testimony of Colonel Fitzwilliam,</i>


91
00:09:52,968 --> 00:09:55,470
<i>who knows every particular
of these transactions.</i>


92
00:09:55,553 --> 00:09:59,224
<i>I know not under what form of falsehood
Mr Wickham imposed himself on you,</i>


93
00:09:59,349 --> 00:10:01,768
<i>but I hope you'Il acquit me
of cruelty towards him.</i>


94
00:10:01,851 --> 00:10:05,188
I found that I' d better
not meet Mr Darcy.


95
00:10:05,272 --> 00:10:08,149
Scenes might arise,
unpleasant to more than myself.


96
00:10:09,150 --> 00:10:11,069
<i>The other charge levelled at me,</i>


97
00:10:11,152 --> 00:10:13,905
<i>is that regardless of the
sentiments of either party,</i>


98
00:10:13,989 --> 00:10:16,700
<i>I detached Mr Bingley from your sister.</i>


99
00:10:17,534 --> 00:10:19,452
<i>I have no wish to deny this,</i>


100
00:10:19,536 --> 00:10:22,247
<i>nor can I blame myself for any
of my actions in this matter.</i>


101

(GASPING)


102
00:10:27,585 --> 00:10:29,295
<i>I had not long been in Hertfordshire</i>


103
00:10:29,379 --> 00:10:32,173
<i>before I saw that Bingley
admired your sister,</i>


104
00:10:32,257 --> 00:10:34,050
<i>but it was not until
the dance at Netherfield</i>


105
00:10:34,134 --> 00:10:36,553
<i>that I suspected a serious attachment.</i>


106
00:10:37,512 --> 00:10:39,597
<i>His partiality was clear,</i>


107
00:10:39,681 --> 00:10:42,100
<i>but though she received
his attentions with pleasure,</i>


108
00:10:42,183 --> 00:10:45,353
<i>I did not detect any
symptoms of peculiar regard.</i>


109
00:10:46,104 --> 00:10:48,982
<i>The serenity of her countenance
convinced me that her heart</i>


110
00:10:49,065 --> 00:10:51,234
<i>was not likely to be easily touched.</i>


111
00:10:52,068 --> 00:10:53,611
Insufferable presumption!


112
00:10:53,695 --> 00:10:56,281
<i>I did not wish to believe
her to be indifferent.</i>


113
00:10:56,364 --> 00:10:58,116
<i>I believed it on impartial conviction.</i>


114
00:10:58,783 --> 00:11:00,410
Very impartial!


115
00:11:00,493 --> 00:11:03,204
You've missed the two gentlemen!
They came to take their leave!


116
00:11:03,288 --> 00:11:04,622
Mr Darcy came here?


117
00:11:04,706 --> 00:11:09,544
He went away directly, but the Colonel
waited for you over half an hour!


118
00:11:09,627 --> 00:11:11,671
Now they are gone abroad!


119
00:11:11,755 --> 00:11:15,467
I dare say we shall be able
to bear the deprivation.


120
00:11:28,438 --> 00:11:30,815
<i>As to my objections to the marriage,</i>


121
00:11:30,899 --> 00:11:34,027
<i>the situation of your family,
though objectionable,</i>


122
00:11:34,110 --> 00:11:36,946
<i>was nothing in comparison with
the total want of propriety</i>


123
00:11:37,030 --> 00:11:39,657
<i>so frequently betrayed by your mother,</i>


124
00:11:39,741 --> 00:11:43,286
<i>your younger sisters,
and even occasionally your father.</i>

(LIZZY REMEMBERS MARY SINGING)


126
00:11:49,042 --> 00:11:52,962
That will do extremely well, child.
You have delighted us long enough.


127
00:11:53,797 --> 00:11:56,382
Now there will be a great marriage!


128
00:11:56,966 --> 00:12:02,180
And you know, that will throw the girls
into the paths of other rich men!


129
00:12:10,438 --> 00:12:13,900
<i>My friend left Netherfield for London
on the following day.</i>


130

<i>There I pointed out to
him the certain evils of</i>


131

<i>his choice of your sister
as a prospective bride.</i>


132
00:12:20,156 --> 00:12:23,326
<i>It was not difficult to convince him
of your sister's indifference to him.</i>


133
00:12:23,660 --> 00:12:26,830
<i>I cannot blame myself for
having done thus much.</i>


134
00:12:27,705 --> 00:12:30,125
For destroying all her
hope of happiness?


135
00:12:30,208 --> 00:12:32,836
Yes, I'm sure you do not blame yourself.
Hateful man!


136
00:12:33,169 --> 00:12:36,422
<i>There is but one part of my conduct
in the affair on which I do not</i>

138
00:12:38,508 --> 00:12:39,884
Astonish me!


139
00:12:39,968 --> 00:12:43,388
<i>That I concealed from him
your sister's being in town.</i>


140
00:12:49,018 --> 00:12:51,938
<i>Perhaps this concealment was beneath me.</i>


141
00:12:52,021 --> 00:12:54,524
<i>It was done, however, for the best.</i>


142
00:12:54,649 --> 00:12:59,112
<i>On this subject I have nothing more to
say, and no other apology to offer.</i>


143
00:12:59,195 --> 00:13:00,697
Insufferable!


144
00:13:01,698 --> 00:13:04,742
- (CHARLOTTE): Lizzy!
- (COLLINS): Charlotte, we will be late!


145
00:13:04,826 --> 00:13:06,536
(CHARLOTTE): Lizzy!


146
00:13:08,538 --> 00:13:11,124
(COLLINS): I have endeavoured
to count the times


147
00:13:11,207 --> 00:13:14,335
Lady Catherine has invited
us since your arrival.


148
00:13:14,419 --> 00:13:17,463
I believe it may be as
many as ten invitations!


149
00:13:17,547 --> 00:13:20,633
- (MARIA): Eleven, counting this one!
- (COLLINS): Eleven!


150
00:13:20,717 --> 00:13:25,847
There! You have indeed been favoured
with peculiar condescension.


151
00:13:26,222 --> 00:13:29,767
- Do you not agree, Miss Elizabeth ?
- Oh... yes!


152
00:13:29,851 --> 00:13:32,645
How could anybody think otherwise?


153
00:13:32,729 --> 00:13:36,649
And this is your last invitation,
on this visit, at least.


154
00:13:36,733 --> 00:13:39,485
It is truly a very cruel deprivation.


155
00:13:39,569 --> 00:13:43,656
I hardly know how I'Il bear the loss of
her ladyship's company!


156
00:13:44,073 --> 00:13:45,950
You feel it keenly!


157
00:13:46,784 --> 00:13:50,246
Yes, of course you do,

my poor young cousin.


158
00:13:51,414 --> 00:13:54,125
(LADY CATHERINE): They
were such fine young men,


159
00:13:54,209 --> 00:13:57,503
and so particularly attached to me!


160
00:13:57,921 --> 00:14:02,550
They were excessively sorry to go,
but so they always are!


161
00:14:03,051 --> 00:14:07,680
The dear Colonel rallied
his spirits tolerably,


162
00:14:07,931 --> 00:14:11,226
but Darcy seemed to
feel it most acutely.


163
00:14:11,768 --> 00:14:15,939
His attachment to
Rosings certainly increases.


164
00:14:19,359 --> 00:14:23,404
You are very dull this evening,
Miss Elizabeth Bennet.


165
00:14:23,488 --> 00:14:28,493
You have scarce spoke two words
together. Are you so out of spirits?


166
00:14:28,576 --> 00:14:31,037
- No indeed, madam.
- Of course you are,


167
00:14:31,120 --> 00:14:33,206
to be going away yourself.


168
00:14:33,289 --> 00:14:37,043
Who indeed would not be sad
to be deprived of Rosings,


169
00:14:37,126 --> 00:14:38,878
and indeed of the gracious...


170
00:14:38,962 --> 00:14:43,007
You will write to your mother
and say you wish to stay longer.


171
00:14:43,091 --> 00:14:46,010
Surely she could spare
you for another fortnight.


172
00:14:46,094 --> 00:14:47,595
But my father cannot.


173
00:14:49,138 --> 00:14:51,683
He wrote to hurry my return.


174
00:14:51,766 --> 00:14:53,017
Your ladyship is very kind,


175
00:14:53,101 --> 00:14:55,561
but I believe we must
leave as planned on Friday.


176
00:14:55,645 --> 00:14:59,399
Your father may spare
you if your mother can.


177
00:14:59,482 --> 00:15:02,318
Daughters are never of much
consequence to a father.


178
00:15:02,402 --> 00:15:05,905
And if you will stay
another month complete,


179
00:15:06,614 --> 00:15:10,243
it will be in my power to take you
as far as London myself,


180
00:15:10,326 --> 00:15:12,328
in the Barouche box!


181
00:15:12,704 --> 00:15:18,418
For I cannot bear the idea of two young
women travelling post by themselves.


182
00:15:18,501 --> 00:15:20,795
It is highly improper!


183
00:15:21,879 --> 00:15:25,216
I am excessively attentive
to all those things.


184
00:15:25,300 --> 00:15:29,178
My uncle is to send a servant for us
when we change to the post.


185
00:15:29,262 --> 00:15:35,226
Your uncle!
He keeps a manservant, does he?


186
00:15:36,185 --> 00:15:39,063
I'm very glad you have somebody
who thinks of these things.


187
00:15:39,147 --> 00:15:40,857
Where will you change horses?


188
00:15:40,940 --> 00:15:43,234
- At Brom...
- Bromley, of course.


189
00:15:43,318 --> 00:15:46,696
Mention my name at the Bell
and they will attend you.


190
00:15:47,530 --> 00:15:49,699
Your ladyship is very kind.


191
00:15:49,782 --> 00:15:52,577
Indeed, we are all infinitely
indebted to your ladyship's


192
00:15:52,660 --> 00:15:54,537
kindly bestowed solicitude...


193
00:15:54,621 --> 00:15:58,624
Yes, yes, but this is
all extremely vexing!


194
00:16:00,043 --> 00:16:02,211
I'm quite put out.


195
00:16:03,212 --> 00:16:06,466
What are you doing? I thought the trunks
went outside before breakfast.


196
00:16:06,549 --> 00:16:10,970
Lady Catherine was so severe about the
only right way to place gowns,


197
00:16:11,054 --> 00:16:15,016
that I couldn't sleep,
and I'm determined to start afresh!


198
00:16:15,099 --> 00:16:17,643
Maria, this is <i>your</i> trunk
and <i>your </i>gowns.


199
00:16:17,727 --> 00:16:22,148
You may arrange them in any way you
wish. Lady Catherine will never know!


200
00:16:23,274 --> 00:16:26,736
(COLLINS): My dear sister,
you'Il have much to tell your father...


201
00:16:26,819 --> 00:16:29,447
(CHARLOTTE): Bring that one round here.


202
00:16:29,530 --> 00:16:31,532
(BACKGROUND CONVERSATION)


203
00:16:39,749 --> 00:16:41,417
Well, cousin...


204
00:16:41,709 --> 00:16:45,004
..you have seen for yourself now
the happiness of our situation.


205
00:16:45,797 --> 00:16:50,009
Our intimacy at Rosings is a blessing
of which few could boast!


206
00:16:50,093 --> 00:16:53,429
- Indeed they could not.
- Indeed.


207
00:16:54,305 --> 00:16:56,224
Now you have seen our felicity.


208
00:16:56,307 --> 00:17:00,895
Perhaps you may think your friend
has made a fortunate alliance.


209
00:17:01,104 --> 00:17:03,231
Perhaps more so than...


210
00:17:04,190 --> 00:17:07,068
But on this point it will
be as well to be silent.


211
00:17:07,151 --> 00:17:08,945
You are very good.


212
00:17:11,114 --> 00:17:14,409
Only let me assure you that I can,
from my heart,


213
00:17:14,492 --> 00:17:18,788
most cordially wish you
equal felicity in marriage.


214
00:17:18,871 --> 00:17:22,917
Charlotte and I have but one mind
and one way of thinking.


215
00:17:24,168 --> 00:17:27,171
We seem to have been
designed for each other!


216
00:17:49,026 --> 00:17:52,655
Oh, Lizzy! It seems but a day or two
since we first came!


217
00:17:52,739 --> 00:17:57,243
- And yet how many things have happened!
- A great many, indeed.


218
00:17:57,326 --> 00:18:00,329
(MARIA): We have dined
nine times at Rosings!


219
00:18:01,122 --> 00:18:03,833
Oh, how much I shall have to tell!


220
00:18:05,084 --> 00:18:07,503
How much I shall have to conceal.


221
00:18:18,473 --> 00:18:22,518
You must allow me to tell you
how ardently I admire and love you.


222
00:18:45,374 --> 00:18:46,584
Lizzy!


223
00:18:47,251 --> 00:18:48,419
Lizzy!


224
00:18:58,137 --> 00:19:01,182
To see your faces when you looked up!


225
00:19:01,265 --> 00:19:03,434
You didn't expect we' d come to meet you.


226
00:19:03,518 --> 00:19:04,894
No, we did not.


227
00:19:04,977 --> 00:19:07,396
There! Is not this nice ?


228
00:19:07,480 --> 00:19:10,691
Cold ham, and pork,
and salads, and every good thing!


229
00:19:10,775 --> 00:19:15,363
We mean to treat you, but you must
lend us money, we spent ours. Look!


230
00:19:15,446 --> 00:19:18,074
It's not pretty,
but I thought I' d buy it anyway.


231
00:19:18,157 --> 00:19:20,117
It's vile, isn't it?


232
00:19:20,201 --> 00:19:22,703
Very ugly.
What possessed you to buy it?


233
00:19:22,787 --> 00:19:24,997
There were two or three much uglier!


234
00:19:25,081 --> 00:19:29,085
I shall pull it to pieces
and see if I can make it up any better.


235
00:19:29,961 --> 00:19:31,879
It doesn't signify what anyone wears,


236
00:19:31,963 --> 00:19:35,508
for the regiment
will be at Brighton the whole summer!


237
00:19:35,591 --> 00:19:37,009
Our hearts are broken!


238
00:19:37,093 --> 00:19:40,930
And papa refuses to take us to Brighton.


239
00:19:41,055 --> 00:19:45,142
- I'm glad to hear it.
- Shouldn't you like to go to Brighton?


240
00:19:45,351 --> 00:19:47,436
- I should not.
- She would.


241
00:19:47,520 --> 00:19:51,941
She would love it, when she hears the
news about a certain person we know!


242
00:19:52,024 --> 00:19:56,529
- Shall we tell her ?
- Yes, and see if she blushes!


243
00:19:57,113 --> 00:19:59,657
You may go.
We'Il call if you're needed again.


244
00:19:59,740 --> 00:20:01,367
Very good, miss.


245
00:20:06,414 --> 00:20:09,375
Wickham is not to marry
Mary King after all!


246
00:20:09,458 --> 00:20:12,962
She's been taken away to Liverpool
and Wickham is safe!


247
00:20:14,255 --> 00:20:16,716
Perhaps we should say Mary King is safe.


248
00:20:16,799 --> 00:20:20,177
Was there a very strong attraction
between them, do you think?


249
00:20:20,261 --> 00:20:24,390
Not on his side! I shouldn't think
he cared three straws about her .


250
00:20:24,473 --> 00:20:27,852
Who could about such a
nasty freckled little thing?


251
00:20:28,769 --> 00:20:32,481
Don't look at me like that, Lizzy.
You think just as ill of her!


252
00:20:32,565 --> 00:20:33,899
Pass the celery, Kitty.


253
00:20:33,983 --> 00:20:37,987
Glad we came to meet you?
It'Il be merry on the journey home.


254
00:20:38,446 --> 00:20:40,489
(LYDIA): Kitty, you're
squashing my bandbox!


255
00:20:40,573 --> 00:20:43,909
(KITTY): You should
have put it on the roof!


256
00:20:43,993 --> 00:20:46,495
(LYDIA): If you don't lollop
about there is room.


257
00:20:46,579 --> 00:20:49,624
(KITTY): I don't lollop, <i>you </i>do!


258
00:20:50,291 --> 00:20:54,337
Mr Darcy proposed!
I can scarce believe it!


259
00:20:55,379 --> 00:20:58,674
Not that anyone admiring you
should be astonishing.


260
00:20:58,758 --> 00:21:02,553
But he always seemed so severe,
so cold, apparently.


261
00:21:03,721 --> 00:21:07,475
And yet he was in love with
you all the time! Poor Mr Darcy.


262
00:21:08,184 --> 00:21:10,686
I cannot feel so much
compassion for him.


263
00:21:10,770 --> 00:21:15,358
He has other feelings which will soon
drive away any regard he felt for me.


264
00:21:16,734 --> 00:21:20,988
- You do not blame me for refusing him?
- Blame you? Oh, no.


265
00:21:24,033 --> 00:21:27,244
But you do blame me for speaking
so warmly of Wickham?


266
00:21:27,328 --> 00:21:30,790
No. How could you have
known about his vicious character ?


267
00:21:30,873 --> 00:21:33,042
If indeed he was so very bad.


268
00:21:33,334 --> 00:21:38,214
But I cannot believe Mr Darcy would
fabricate such dreadful slander,


269
00:21:38,631 --> 00:21:40,841
involving his own sister too.


270
00:21:42,218 --> 00:21:43,969
No, it must be true.


271
00:21:45,429 --> 00:21:47,098
Perhaps there has been
some terrible mistake.


272
00:21:47,181 --> 00:21:52,812
No, Jane. That won't do!
You can't make them both good!


273
00:21:53,020 --> 00:21:57,233
There is just enough merit between them
to make one good sort of man.


274
00:21:58,067 --> 00:22:01,612
And for my part I'm inclined to
believe it's all Mr Darcy's.


275
00:22:01,696 --> 00:22:03,197
Poor Mr Darcy.


276
00:22:04,323 --> 00:22:06,283
Poor Mr Wickham!


277
00:22:06,367 --> 00:22:09,954
There is such an expression
of goodness in his countenance.


278
00:22:10,037 --> 00:22:12,498
Yes.
I'm afraid one has all the goodness,


279
00:22:12,581 --> 00:22:14,917
and the other all the appearance of it!


280
00:22:16,335 --> 00:22:20,256
But Lizzy, I am sure that when you
first read that letter,


281
00:22:20,881 --> 00:22:23,634
you could not have made so
light of it as you do now.


282
00:22:24,760 --> 00:22:26,470
Indeed I could not.


283
00:22:26,971 --> 00:22:31,767
I was very uncomfortable.
Till that moment I never knew myself.


284
00:22:32,852 --> 00:22:35,187
And I had no Jane to comfort me.


285
00:22:36,522 --> 00:22:38,315
Oh, how I wanted you!


286
00:22:43,279 --> 00:22:46,282
There is one point on
which I want your advice.


287
00:22:46,365 --> 00:22:51,162
Should our general acquaintance be
informed of Wickham's true character ?


288
00:22:53,539 --> 00:22:57,126
Surely there can be no occasion
to expose him so cruelly.


289
00:22:58,002 --> 00:23:01,297
- What is your opinion?
- That it oughtn't be attempted.


290
00:23:01,380 --> 00:23:05,217
Mr Darcy has not authorised
me to make it public,


291
00:23:05,301 --> 00:23:07,344
especially as regards his sister.


292
00:23:09,805 --> 00:23:12,433
As for the rest, who would believe it?


293
00:23:12,516 --> 00:23:15,770
The general prejudice against
Mr Darcy is so violent,


294
00:23:15,853 --> 00:23:17,104
and Wickham will soon be gone.


295
00:23:17,188 --> 00:23:20,399
I believe we should
say nothing at present.


296
00:23:20,483 --> 00:23:21,984
Yes, I agree.


297
00:23:23,819 --> 00:23:25,905
Perhaps he is sorry now
for what he has done,


298
00:23:25,988 --> 00:23:29,283
and is anxious to
re-establish his character .


299
00:23:29,408 --> 00:23:31,660
We must not make him desperate.


300
00:23:31,744 --> 00:23:36,207
Oh, Jane! I wish I could think
so well of people as you do.


301
00:23:38,334 --> 00:23:41,045
Won't you speak to papa, Lizzy,
about our going to Brighton?


302
00:23:41,128 --> 00:23:43,756
You know he listens to your advice.


303
00:23:43,839 --> 00:23:48,093
You flatter me, Lydia. In any case,
I shouldn't attempt to persuade him.


304
00:23:48,177 --> 00:23:52,598
I think it's a very good thing that the
regiment is removed from Meryton,


305
00:23:52,723 --> 00:23:55,100
and that we are removed
from the regiment.


306
00:23:55,184 --> 00:23:58,229
Oh, Lizzy,
how can you say such a thing?


307
00:23:58,312 --> 00:23:59,939
Very easily, ma'am.


308
00:24:00,022 --> 00:24:03,609
If one company causes
such havoc in our family,


309
00:24:03,692 --> 00:24:06,362
what would a whole
campful of soldiers do?


310
00:24:07,530 --> 00:24:10,449
A whole campful of soldiers!


311
00:24:10,533 --> 00:24:12,701
(MOTHER): I remember when I was a girl.


312
00:24:12,785 --> 00:24:16,455
I cried for two days when
Colonel Miller's regiment went away.


313
00:24:16,539 --> 00:24:18,791
I thought I should have broke my heart!


314
00:24:18,874 --> 00:24:20,668
I shall break mine.


315
00:24:20,751 --> 00:24:22,127
And I!


316
00:24:23,504 --> 00:24:25,756
There, there, my dears.


317
00:24:25,840 --> 00:24:28,467
But your father is
determined to be cruel.


318
00:24:28,551 --> 00:24:30,052
I confess I am.


319
00:24:30,636 --> 00:24:34,890
I'm sorry to be breaking hearts,
but I have no intention of yielding.


320
00:24:35,141 --> 00:24:37,309
I shall not break my heart, papa.


321
00:24:37,393 --> 00:24:39,937
The pleasures of Brighton
would have no charms for me.


322
00:24:40,020 --> 00:24:42,398
I should infinitely prefer a book.


323
00:24:42,481 --> 00:24:44,984
Mrs Forster says she
plans to go sea-bathing.


324
00:24:45,067 --> 00:24:47,945
I am sure I should love
to go sea-bathing!


325
00:24:48,571 --> 00:24:51,490
A little sea-bathing
would set me up forever!


326
00:24:51,574 --> 00:24:53,576
And yet, I am unmoved.


327
00:24:53,951 --> 00:24:55,411
Well, well.


328
00:24:55,995 --> 00:25:00,541
I'm glad you are come back, Lizzy.
I'm glad you are come back, Jane.


329
00:25:05,421 --> 00:25:07,756
I want to go to Brighton!


330
00:25:32,323 --> 00:25:34,283
You are not happy, Jane.


331
00:25:35,117 --> 00:25:38,871
- It pains me to see it.
- It is just that I did...


332
00:25:39,955 --> 00:25:43,792
I'm afraid I still do prefer Mr Bingley
to any other man I've met,


333
00:25:43,876 --> 00:25:47,046
and Lizzy, I did believe he...


334
00:25:49,215 --> 00:25:51,634
Well, I was mistaken, that is all.


335
00:25:53,552 --> 00:25:56,180
I am resolved to think of him no more.


336
00:25:56,639 --> 00:25:59,058
There. Enough.


337
00:25:59,975 --> 00:26:03,646
I shall be myself again,
as if I had never set eyes on him.


338
00:26:07,524 --> 00:26:10,319
Truly, Lizzy, I promise.
I shall be well.


339
00:26:10,486 --> 00:26:15,449
I shall be myself again.
I shall be perfectly content.


340
00:26:26,335 --> 00:26:31,131
Well, Lizzy, what do you think now
about this sad business of Jane's?


341
00:26:31,757 --> 00:26:35,636
I cannot find out that she saw
anything of Bingley in London.


342
00:26:36,178 --> 00:26:37,304
Well.


343
00:26:38,180 --> 00:26:42,184
An undeserving young man!


344
00:26:42,268 --> 00:26:45,521
And I don't suppose there's any
chance of her getting him now.


345
00:26:46,188 --> 00:26:49,984
If he should come back
to Netherfield, though.


346
00:26:50,067 --> 00:26:52,194
I think there's little
chance of that, mamma.


347
00:26:52,278 --> 00:26:54,488
Oh, well. Just as he chooses.


348
00:26:55,197 --> 00:26:57,199
No one wants him to come!


349
00:26:57,700 --> 00:27:02,705
I shall always say he used
my daughter extremely ill!


350
00:27:02,705 --> 00:27:05,124
If I was her,
I would not have put up with it.


351
00:27:05,207 --> 00:27:08,585
My comfort is,
she will die of a broken heart,


352
00:27:08,669 --> 00:27:10,587
and <i>then </i>he'Il be sorry
for what he's done!


353
00:27:11,588 --> 00:27:16,010
So, the Collinses live
quite comfortable, do they?


354
00:27:16,093 --> 00:27:18,095
I only hope it will last.


355
00:27:18,887 --> 00:27:23,642
And I suppose they talk about having
this house too when your father is dead?


356
00:27:23,767 --> 00:27:26,979
They look on it as quite their own,
I dare say?


357
00:27:27,563 --> 00:27:30,399
They could hardly discuss such
a subject in front of me.


358
00:27:30,482 --> 00:27:34,486
I make no doubt they talk about it
constantly when they're alone!


359
00:27:34,611 --> 00:27:38,741
If they can be easy with an estate
that is not lawfully their own,


360
00:27:38,824 --> 00:27:40,409
so much the better!


361
00:27:40,576 --> 00:27:44,580
I should be ashamed of having one
that was only entailed upon me!


362
00:27:45,998 --> 00:27:48,834
Mamma, mamma! Lizzy!


363
00:27:49,460 --> 00:27:53,172
Guess what!
You never will, so I'Il tell you.


364
00:27:53,255 --> 00:27:56,050
Mrs Forster has invited me,
as her particular friend,


365
00:27:56,133 --> 00:27:58,302
to go with her to Brighton.


366
00:27:58,385 --> 00:27:59,887
Colonel Forster is to
take a house for us!


367
00:27:59,970 --> 00:28:02,681
I'm so happy!


368
00:28:02,765 --> 00:28:06,852
- What an honour, to be singled out!
- Is it not unfair, Lizzy?


369
00:28:06,935 --> 00:28:09,438
Mrs Forster should
have asked me as well.


370
00:28:09,521 --> 00:28:12,983
I may not be her dearest friend,
but have as much right to be asked!


371
00:28:13,067 --> 00:28:14,234
(LYDIA LAUGHS SCORNFULLY)


372
00:28:14,318 --> 00:28:17,029
And more too, for I am two years older!


373
00:28:20,783 --> 00:28:23,535
I'Il buy her a present, I dare say.


374
00:28:23,619 --> 00:28:27,122
There's no call to be in a miff because
Mrs Forster likes me best.


375
00:28:27,831 --> 00:28:31,585
Before you crow too loud, remember papa
has not given you permission to go.


376
00:28:31,668 --> 00:28:33,420
Nor is he like to.


377
00:28:33,587 --> 00:28:35,214
Papa won't stop me.


378
00:28:35,297 --> 00:28:40,302
Not when I'm invited by the Colonel to
be his wife's particular companion!


379
00:28:40,969 --> 00:28:42,930
I need new clothes,


380
00:28:43,013 --> 00:28:45,724
for I've nothing fit to wear, and there
will be balls and parties!


381
00:28:45,808 --> 00:28:48,477
Of course you shall have new things!


382
00:28:48,560 --> 00:28:51,563
We wouldn't see you disgraced
in front of all the officers!


383
00:28:51,647 --> 00:28:53,857
(LYDIA): Oo! All the officers!


384
00:28:57,778 --> 00:29:01,824
I understand your concern,
my dear, but consider:


385
00:29:02,658 --> 00:29:07,830
Lydia will never be easy until she has
exposed herself in some public place,


386
00:29:07,955 --> 00:29:10,833
and here is an opportunity
for her to do so,


387
00:29:10,916 --> 00:29:13,544
with very little expense
or inconvenience to her family.


388
00:29:13,627 --> 00:29:17,089
If you were aware of the very
great disadvantage to us all,


389
00:29:17,172 --> 00:29:21,593
which has already arisen from Lydia's
unguarded and imprudent manner,


390
00:29:21,677 --> 00:29:24,388
you'd judge differently.


391
00:29:24,471 --> 00:29:27,558
Already arisen? Has she frightened
away some of your lovers?


392
00:29:27,641 --> 00:29:29,309
Don't be cast down, Lizzy.


393
00:29:29,393 --> 00:29:32,187
Such squeamish youths are
not worth your regret.


394
00:29:32,521 --> 00:29:35,399
- Oh come, Lizzy.
- Indeed you are mistaken.


395
00:29:36,024 --> 00:29:40,821
I have no injuries to resent. I speak
of general, not particular evils.


396
00:29:41,196 --> 00:29:42,197
Our ...


397
00:29:43,532 --> 00:29:46,243
position as a family,
our very respectability,


398
00:29:46,326 --> 00:29:49,288
is called into question by
Lydia's wild behaviour.


399
00:29:52,499 --> 00:29:56,295
I must speak plainly.
If you do not check her,


400
00:29:56,378 --> 00:29:58,630
she will soon be beyond
the reach of amendment.


401
00:29:58,714 --> 00:30:01,341
She will become the
most determined flirt


402
00:30:01,425 --> 00:30:04,178
that ever made herself
and her family ridiculous!


403
00:30:06,054 --> 00:30:09,224
You know that Kitty
follows wherever Lydia leads.


404
00:30:09,433 --> 00:30:13,437
Don't you see that they will be censured
and despised wherever they are known?


405
00:30:13,520 --> 00:30:16,607
And that they will involve their
sisters in their disgrace.


406
00:30:16,690 --> 00:30:18,317
Lizzy, come here.


407
00:30:22,738 --> 00:30:25,282
Don't make yourself uneasy, my love.


408
00:30:25,532 --> 00:30:30,412
Wherever you and Jane are known,
you must be respected and valued.


409
00:30:30,787 --> 00:30:35,000
And you will not appear to any less
advantage for having a couple or...


410
00:30:35,083 --> 00:30:37,753
..I may say, three very silly sisters.


411
00:30:38,754 --> 00:30:43,091
We shall have no peace at Longbourn
if Lydia does not go to Brighton.


412
00:30:44,635 --> 00:30:47,095
Colonel Forster is a sensible man.


413
00:30:48,847 --> 00:30:53,685
And luckily she's too poor to be an
object of prey to a fortune hunter.


414
00:30:55,103 --> 00:30:59,775
Leave it now, Lizzy.
I believe all will turn out well.


415
00:31:10,285 --> 00:31:14,623
We are so desolated, Colonel,
that the regiment is to leave Meryton,


416
00:31:14,957 --> 00:31:19,711
but words cannot express what we feel
about your kindness to our dear Lydia.


417
00:31:20,128 --> 00:31:23,465
Well, ma'am, it appears that
Mrs Forster cannot do without her.


418
00:31:24,800 --> 00:31:27,386
Look at the pair of them.
Thick as thieves!


419
00:31:27,469 --> 00:31:29,972
Lord knows what they find to talk about.


420
00:31:30,055 --> 00:31:34,768
But anything to keep the ladies happy.
What do you say, Wickham?


421
00:31:34,851 --> 00:31:36,853
I say amen to that, sir.


422
00:31:46,154 --> 00:31:49,241
There's one lady I shall be
very loath to part from.


423
00:31:49,324 --> 00:31:53,287
We must try to bear it.
You are for Brighton,


424
00:31:53,370 --> 00:31:55,247
I'Il be touring the Lakes
with my aunt and uncle.


425
00:31:55,455 --> 00:32:00,252
I dare say we'Il find ample sources
of consolation and delight...


426
00:32:00,335 --> 00:32:02,004
in our different ways.


427
00:32:02,129 --> 00:32:05,382
Perhaps. How did you find Rosings?


428
00:32:05,465 --> 00:32:08,844
Interesting. Colonel Fitzwilliam was
there with Mr Darcy.


429
00:32:08,927 --> 00:32:10,929
Are you acquainted with the Colonel?


430
00:32:11,013 --> 00:32:12,139
I...


431
00:32:13,599 --> 00:32:17,519
To some respects, yes, in former years.
A very gentlemanly man.


432
00:32:18,186 --> 00:32:21,773
- How did you like him?
- I liked him very much.


433
00:32:22,232 --> 00:32:25,152
His manners are very
different from his cousin's.


434
00:32:25,235 --> 00:32:26,320
Yes.


435
00:32:27,821 --> 00:32:32,326
But I think Mr Darcy improves
on closer acquaintance.


436
00:32:32,909 --> 00:32:34,119
Indeed?


437
00:32:35,329 --> 00:32:36,913
In what respect?


438
00:32:38,165 --> 00:32:41,293
Has he acquired a touch
of civility in his address?


439
00:32:41,376 --> 00:32:43,879
For I dare not hope he
is improved in essentials.


440
00:32:43,962 --> 00:32:48,300
No. In essentials,
I believe he is very much...


441
00:32:48,383 --> 00:32:50,177
as he ever was.


442
00:32:51,553 --> 00:32:52,596
Ah.


443
00:32:53,722 --> 00:32:56,975
I don't mean to imply
that either his mind


444
00:32:57,059 --> 00:33:00,062
or his manners are
changed for the better.


445
00:33:00,854 --> 00:33:05,901
Rather: my knowing him better
improved my opinion of him.


446
00:33:06,985 --> 00:33:08,153
I see.


447
00:33:08,236 --> 00:33:11,740
(MRS FORSTER): Wickham. Wickham.


448
00:33:12,074 --> 00:33:16,328
- Come here.
- At your service, ma'am!


449
00:33:17,371 --> 00:33:19,664
Yes, go, go.


450
00:33:19,748 --> 00:33:22,084
I would not wish you back again.


451
00:33:27,881 --> 00:33:29,716
Goodbye, papa. Goodbye, mamma.


452
00:33:29,800 --> 00:33:33,512
Lydia, my dear,
we shall miss you most cruelly!


453
00:33:33,595 --> 00:33:36,807
I shall write every day of what I'm
doing and make you wild with envy.


454
00:33:36,890 --> 00:33:41,186
- I can't help it!
- I shall not envy her a jot!


455
00:33:41,478 --> 00:33:44,606
I must go. Goodbye, Jane.
Goodbye, Lizzy!


456
00:33:44,690 --> 00:33:48,777
If I see any eligible beaux for you,
I'Il send word express!


457
00:33:49,361 --> 00:33:52,697
Lord, what a laugh if I should fall
and break my head!


458
00:33:52,781 --> 00:33:54,366
I wish you would!


459
00:33:54,449 --> 00:33:59,287
Oh, my dear girl. Take every
opportunity of enjoying yourself!


460
00:34:00,288 --> 00:34:02,290
Bye! Bye!


461
00:34:19,349 --> 00:34:23,145
Never mind, Kitty.
I dare say, in a year or two


462
00:34:23,228 --> 00:34:25,105
you'Il have got over it tolerably well.


463
00:34:26,982 --> 00:34:31,778
If anyone should ask for me, I shall be
in my library, and not to be disturbed.


464
00:34:52,048 --> 00:34:56,845
(JANE): Hello! I can see, I can see
Alicia. Look how she has grown!


465
00:35:00,265 --> 00:35:02,767
(JANE): You must be so tired.


466
00:35:05,187 --> 00:35:10,025
You have all grown! I think you've all
grown since we last said goodbye!


467
00:35:10,108 --> 00:35:12,736
And very pretty too!
Come into the house, then.


468
00:35:12,819 --> 00:35:15,697
Such a sweet, steady girl!


469
00:35:15,906 --> 00:35:17,407
Well, Lizzy!


470
00:35:19,701 --> 00:35:23,788
We bear you bad tidings.
Not too grievous though, I hope.


471
00:35:23,872 --> 00:35:25,248
The guilt is mine.


472
00:35:25,332 --> 00:35:28,752
My business won't allow me
time away to visit all the Lake country.


473
00:35:28,835 --> 00:35:31,671
We shall have to content
ourselves with Derbyshire.


474
00:35:31,755 --> 00:35:32,797
Oh.


475
00:35:33,673 --> 00:35:36,676
But Derbyshire has many
beauties, has it not?


476
00:35:36,760 --> 00:35:40,138
Indeed. To me Derbyshire
is the best of all counties.


477
00:35:40,388 --> 00:35:44,434
You will judge for yourself whether
Chatsworth is not the equal of Blenheim.


478
00:35:44,518 --> 00:35:48,813
And surely these southern counties
have nothing to compare to the wild


479
00:35:48,897 --> 00:35:51,691
<i>and untamed beauty of the Peaks.</i>


480
00:35:58,031 --> 00:36:01,201
(UNCLE GARDINER): Nature and culture
in harmony, you see, Lizzy.


481
00:36:01,284 --> 00:36:05,997
Wildness and artifice,
and all in the one perfect county!


482
00:36:06,081 --> 00:36:10,001
(AUNT GARDINER): I was born here,
so I should never disagree with that!


483
00:36:10,085 --> 00:36:11,169
(LIZZY): Where?


484
00:36:11,253 --> 00:36:13,880
(AUNT): At Lambton,
a town of no consequence,


485
00:36:13,964 --> 00:36:16,925
but to those fortunate
enough to have lived in it.


486
00:36:17,133 --> 00:36:20,554
I think it the dearest
place in the world!


487
00:36:20,637 --> 00:36:23,723
Then I shall not be
happy till I have seen it.


488
00:36:23,932 --> 00:36:26,810
It has one further
claim on your interest:


489
00:36:26,893 --> 00:36:29,104
it is but five miles from Pemberley,


490
00:36:29,187 --> 00:36:32,857
and owes much of its
prosperity to that great estate.


491
00:36:32,941 --> 00:36:34,025
So near ?


492
00:36:34,109 --> 00:36:36,695
Not that I or anyone of my acquaintance


493
00:36:36,778 --> 00:36:40,198
enjoyed the privilege
of intimacy with that family.


494
00:36:40,282 --> 00:36:43,034
We moved in very different circles.


495
00:36:54,754 --> 00:36:57,299
A hit! Acknowledged. Very good, sir!


496
00:36:58,800 --> 00:37:01,720
- Enough, sir ?
- Enough. Thank you, Baines.


497
00:37:01,803 --> 00:37:05,765
- Will you come again tomorrow, sir ?
- No, I have business in the North.


498
00:37:05,849 --> 00:37:09,894
- I'Il come tomorrow week.
- Very good, sir. Bid you good day, sir.


499
00:37:09,978 --> 00:37:12,105
Thank you, Baines. Good day.


500
00:37:16,651 --> 00:37:20,155
I shall conquer this. I shall!


501
00:37:33,168 --> 00:37:35,462
(AUNT): Elizabeth, be careful!


502
00:37:35,545 --> 00:37:38,882
How could I face your
father if you took a fall?


503
00:37:43,011 --> 00:37:44,346
Beautiful!


504
00:37:52,062 --> 00:37:54,898
- Thank you, Hannah.
- You're welcome, sir.


505
00:37:57,651 --> 00:38:01,279
I should be quite happy to stay
my whole life in Derbyshire!


506
00:38:01,363 --> 00:38:06,451
I'm happy to hear it. What do you say
to visiting Pemberley tomorrow?


507
00:38:06,534 --> 00:38:10,288
It's not more than a mile
or two out of our way.


508
00:38:10,372 --> 00:38:12,582
Do you especially wish to see it, aunt?


509
00:38:12,666 --> 00:38:15,919
I thought <i>you </i>would,
having heard so much about it.


510
00:38:16,294 --> 00:38:19,047
The associations are
not all unpleasant.


511
00:38:19,130 --> 00:38:21,966
Wickham passed all
his youth there, you know.


512
00:38:22,050 --> 00:38:23,843
We have no business there.


513
00:38:23,927 --> 00:38:28,139
I should feel awkward to visit the place
without a proper invitation.


514
00:38:28,223 --> 00:38:32,310
No more than Blenheim or Chatsworth.
There was no awkwardness there.


515
00:38:32,394 --> 00:38:34,688
I shouldn't care for it myself, Lizzy,


516
00:38:34,771 --> 00:38:37,982
if it were merely a fine house,
richly furnished.


517
00:38:38,066 --> 00:38:40,068
But the grounds are delightful.


518
00:38:40,151 --> 00:38:42,987
They have some of the
finest woods in the country.


519
00:38:43,071 --> 00:38:47,450
- How far is Pemberley, my dear ?
- Not more than five miles, sir.


520
00:38:47,534 --> 00:38:49,494
The grounds are very fine, are they not?


521
00:38:49,577 --> 00:38:52,497
As fine as you'Il see anywhere, ma'am.


522
00:38:52,580 --> 00:38:55,583
My oldest brother is
an under-gardener there.


523
00:38:56,751 --> 00:38:59,921
- Is the family here for the summer ?
- No, ma'am.


524
00:39:02,507 --> 00:39:03,550
Well?


525
00:39:06,803 --> 00:39:09,639
Perhaps we might visit
Pemberley after all.


526
00:39:42,589 --> 00:39:44,799
I think we've seen
woods and groves enough


527
00:39:44,883 --> 00:39:48,011
to satisfy even your
enthusiasm for them, Lizzy!


528
00:39:48,094 --> 00:39:51,723
I confess I had no idea Pemberley
was such a great estate.


529
00:39:51,806 --> 00:39:54,392
Shall we reach the house
itself before dark?


530
00:39:54,476 --> 00:39:56,519
Be patient. Wait.


531
00:40:00,648 --> 00:40:02,150
(AUNT): There!


532
00:40:02,817 --> 00:40:04,903
(UNCLE): Stop the coach!


533
00:40:09,574 --> 00:40:13,912
I think one would put up with a good
deal to be mistress of Pemberley.


534
00:40:13,995 --> 00:40:17,373
The mistress of Pemberley <i>will</i>
have to put up with a good deal,


535
00:40:17,457 --> 00:40:18,625
from what I hear .


536
00:40:18,708 --> 00:40:21,336
She's not likely to be anyone <i>we </i>know.


537
00:40:23,129 --> 00:40:27,217
- How do you like the house, Lizzy?
- Very well.


538
00:40:28,676 --> 00:40:32,555
I don't think I've ever seen a
place so happily situated.


539
00:40:33,681 --> 00:40:35,767
I like it very well indeed.


540
00:40:37,519 --> 00:40:39,103
(UNCLE): Drive on!


541
00:40:39,187 --> 00:40:43,566
A pity then, its owner should be
such a proud and disagreeable man.


542
00:40:44,400 --> 00:40:46,152
Yes, a great pity.


543
00:40:49,072 --> 00:40:50,615
Perhaps the beauty of the house


544
00:40:50,698 --> 00:40:54,118
renders its owner a little
less repulsive, Lizzy?


545
00:40:54,369 --> 00:40:56,287
Yes, perhaps.


546
00:40:58,039 --> 00:40:59,999
Perhaps a <i>very </i>little.


547
00:41:01,334 --> 00:41:06,381
Well, shall we apply to the housekeeper
to see inside the place?


548
00:41:23,273 --> 00:41:26,526
That's where Mrs Darcy used to
write her letters every morning.


549
00:41:26,609 --> 00:41:28,611
It was her favourite room.


550
00:41:34,242 --> 00:41:36,119
This is the music room.


551
00:41:38,746 --> 00:41:41,916
- (AUNT): Charming!
- (UNCLE): What a lovely room!


552
00:41:42,167 --> 00:41:43,918
(AUNT): Delightful!


553
00:41:47,755 --> 00:41:52,218
And there's a fine prospect from that
window down towards the lake.


554
00:41:53,553 --> 00:41:57,682
- (AUNT): Look at this, my dear.
- (UNCLE): It's quite magnificent!


555
00:42:03,646 --> 00:42:05,481
Of all this I might have been mistress.


556
00:42:05,565 --> 00:42:07,775
This piano has just come down.


557
00:42:07,859 --> 00:42:10,904
It's a present from my
master for Miss Georgiana.


558
00:42:10,987 --> 00:42:13,281
Your master is from home,
we understand.


559
00:42:13,364 --> 00:42:16,200
Yes, but we expect
him here tomorrow, sir.


560
00:42:16,409 --> 00:42:20,622
He is coming with a large party of
friends and Miss Georgiana.


561
00:42:25,543 --> 00:42:30,006
This portrait was painted earlier this
year, for her sixteenth birthday.


562
00:42:30,882 --> 00:42:33,801
She is a very handsome young lady!


563
00:42:33,885 --> 00:42:37,972
Oh, yes! The handsomest young
lady that ever was seen.


564
00:42:38,056 --> 00:42:43,227
And so accomplished.
She plays and sings all day long!


565
00:42:43,478 --> 00:42:44,646
Lizzy!


566
00:42:45,104 --> 00:42:46,940
Look at this picture.


567
00:42:50,151 --> 00:42:53,112
It reminds me very much
of someone we know!


568
00:42:53,196 --> 00:42:54,822
This one, ma'am?


569
00:42:55,156 --> 00:43:00,578
That young gentleman was the son of the
late Mr Darcy's steward, Mr Wickham.


570
00:43:00,662 --> 00:43:04,123
He is gone into the army now.
But he's turned out very wild.


571
00:43:04,207 --> 00:43:06,167
Very wild indeed, I'm afraid.


572
00:43:07,502 --> 00:43:11,881
And that's my master.
And very like him too.


573
00:43:11,965 --> 00:43:14,842
It's a handsome face,
but I've never seen the original.


574
00:43:14,926 --> 00:43:16,260
Is it like him, Lizzy?


575
00:43:16,344 --> 00:43:22,100
- Does this young lady know the master ?
- Yes, a little.


576
00:43:22,183 --> 00:43:25,603
And he is a handsome gentleman,
is he not, ma'am?


577
00:43:25,687 --> 00:43:30,358
- Yes, very handsome.
- I'm sure I know none so handsome.


578
00:43:30,441 --> 00:43:32,568
- Nor so kind.
- (UNCLE): Indeed?


579
00:43:32,652 --> 00:43:36,656
Aye, sir.
I've never had a cross word from him,


580
00:43:36,739 --> 00:43:39,325
and I've known him since
he was four years old.


581
00:43:39,617 --> 00:43:44,288
I've observed that they that are
good-natured as children,


582
00:43:44,372 --> 00:43:46,666
are good-natured when they grow up.


583
00:43:46,749 --> 00:43:48,459
(AUNT): His father was an excellent man.


584
00:43:48,543 --> 00:43:52,296
He was, ma'am.
His son will be just like him.


585
00:43:52,380 --> 00:43:58,302
The best landlord, and the best master.
Ask any of his tenants or his servants.


586
00:43:58,928 --> 00:44:03,975
Some call him proud. I fancy that's only
because he don't rattle away,


587
00:44:04,058 --> 00:44:06,269
like other young men do.


588
00:44:06,352 --> 00:44:07,645
Now if you will follow me,


589
00:44:07,729 --> 00:44:11,774
there's a finer, larger portrait of
him in the gallery upstairs.


590
00:44:12,317 --> 00:44:14,527
This way, sir, if you please.


591
00:44:14,986 --> 00:44:17,655
This fine account of
Darcy is not quite consistent


592
00:44:17,739 --> 00:44:19,991
with his behaviour to poor Wickham.


593
00:44:20,074 --> 00:44:21,826
Perhaps we might have
been deceived there.


594
00:44:21,909 --> 00:44:24,495
That's not likely, is it?


595
00:45:21,636 --> 00:45:22,720
Ah!


596
00:45:24,472 --> 00:45:26,307
(UNCLE): Magnificent!


597
00:45:38,653 --> 00:45:40,738
(MRS REYNOLDS): There!


598
00:46:57,398 --> 00:46:58,858
(GROOM): Would you not
like to ride him, sir ?


599
00:46:58,941 --> 00:47:01,527
(DARCY): No, take
him back to the stables.


600
00:47:35,353 --> 00:47:36,604
Mr Darcy.


601
00:47:38,981 --> 00:47:42,109
Miss Bennet. I...


602
00:47:42,193 --> 00:47:45,279
I did not expect to see you, sir.


603
00:47:45,363 --> 00:47:48,199
We understood the family were from home,
or we should never have...


604
00:47:48,282 --> 00:47:50,284
I returned a day early.


605
00:47:51,244 --> 00:47:53,621
Excuse me,
your parents are in good health ?


606
00:47:54,080 --> 00:47:57,959
Yes, they are very well.
I thank you, sir.


607
00:47:58,459 --> 00:48:00,253
I'm glad to hear it.


608
00:48:01,879 --> 00:48:04,423
How long have you been in
this part of the country?


609
00:48:04,507 --> 00:48:06,175
But two days, sir.


610
00:48:08,135 --> 00:48:10,179
- Where are you staying?
- Lambton Inn.


611
00:48:10,263 --> 00:48:11,806
Yes, of course.


612
00:48:14,684 --> 00:48:16,936
Well, I'm just arrived myself.


613
00:48:18,813 --> 00:48:22,316
And your parents are in good health ?
And all your sisters?


614
00:48:22,400 --> 00:48:26,237
Yes, they are all in
excellent health, sir.


615
00:48:28,990 --> 00:48:30,324
Excuse me.


616
00:48:39,292 --> 00:48:43,170
- The man himself, I presume!
- As handsome as in his portrait.


617
00:48:43,254 --> 00:48:46,257
Though perhaps a little
less formally attired.


618
00:48:46,340 --> 00:48:48,426
We must leave here at once!


619
00:48:48,509 --> 00:48:52,013
- Of course, if you wish.
- Oh, I wish we' d never come!


620
00:48:53,014 --> 00:48:56,809
- What must he think of me?
- (AUNT): What did he say?


621
00:48:57,476 --> 00:49:00,980
Nothing of consequence.
He enquired after my parents...


622
00:49:18,789 --> 00:49:20,374
Miss Bennet.


623
00:49:21,000 --> 00:49:25,338
Allow me to apologise for not receiving
you properly. Were you leaving?


624
00:49:25,421 --> 00:49:27,965
We were, sir. I think we must.


625
00:49:28,049 --> 00:49:30,676
I hope you are not
displeased with Pemberley?


626
00:49:32,094 --> 00:49:33,637
No, not at all.


627
00:49:34,513 --> 00:49:36,807
Then you approve of it?


628
00:49:36,891 --> 00:49:40,436
Very much.
I think there are few who would not.


629
00:49:40,519 --> 00:49:44,398
Your good opinion is rarely bestowed,
and therefore more worth the earning.


630
00:49:45,316 --> 00:49:46,650
Thank you.


631
00:49:48,361 --> 00:49:50,738
Would you introduce me to your friends?


632
00:49:51,238 --> 00:49:52,406
Certainly.


633
00:49:52,865 --> 00:49:55,826
Mr and Mrs Edward Gardiner, Mr Darcy.
Mrs Gardiner is my aunt, Mr Darcy.


634
00:49:55,910 --> 00:50:01,999
My sister Jane stayed at their house in
Cheapside when she was in London.


635
00:50:02,083 --> 00:50:05,002
Delighted to make your acquaintance,
madam, sir.


636
00:50:05,086 --> 00:50:06,545
You're staying at Lambton, I hear.


637
00:50:06,629 --> 00:50:09,632
Yes, sir. I grew up there as a girl.


638
00:50:09,715 --> 00:50:10,883
Delightful village.


639
00:50:10,966 --> 00:50:15,179
I ran to Lambton as a boy almost every
day in the horse-chestnut season.


640
00:50:15,429 --> 00:50:19,600
- There was one very fine tree there.
- On the green, by the smithy!


641
00:50:21,852 --> 00:50:26,357
- Mr Gardiner, do you care for fishing?
- Indeed I do, when I get the chance.


642
00:50:26,440 --> 00:50:29,151
You must fish in my trout stream.


643
00:50:29,235 --> 00:50:33,072
There are carp, tench and pike in
the lake, for coarse fishing.


644
00:50:33,280 --> 00:50:36,784
I'Il gladly provide you with rods and
tackle, show you the best spots.


645
00:50:36,867 --> 00:50:38,119
Let's walk down now.


646
00:50:38,202 --> 00:50:41,247
Follow us to the lake.
My man will show you.


647
00:50:41,956 --> 00:50:44,083
(DARCY): There's a place down there
where we...


648
00:50:44,166 --> 00:50:46,710
Is this the proud Darcy you told us of?


649
00:50:46,794 --> 00:50:50,464
He is all ease and friendliness.
No false dignity at all!


650
00:50:50,631 --> 00:50:52,633
I'm as astonished as you are.


651
00:50:52,717 --> 00:50:55,386
I can't imagine what has
affected this transformation.


652
00:50:55,469 --> 00:50:56,971
Can you not?


653
00:51:17,491 --> 00:51:19,577
- (DARCY): Do you...
- (LIZZY): I...


654
00:51:19,660 --> 00:51:21,537
(DARCY): Pray continue.


655
00:51:22,496 --> 00:51:26,834
I was going to say again, sir,
how very unexpected your arrival was.


656
00:51:27,126 --> 00:51:29,628
If we had known you were to be here,
we should not have


657
00:51:29,712 --> 00:51:32,423
dreamt of invading your privacy.


658
00:51:32,757 --> 00:51:35,759
The housekeeper assured us
you would not be here until tomorrow.


659
00:51:35,843 --> 00:51:39,472
Do not make yourself uneasy.
I had planned it so myself,


660
00:51:39,555 --> 00:51:41,098
but I found I had
business with my steward.


661
00:51:41,182 --> 00:51:44,810
I rode on ahead
of the rest of the party.


662
00:51:46,061 --> 00:51:48,189
They will join me tomorrow.


663
00:51:49,356 --> 00:51:53,068
And among them are those who claim
an acquaintance with you.


664
00:51:54,153 --> 00:51:56,489
It's Mr Bingley and his sisters.


665
00:51:59,909 --> 00:52:00,993
Oh.


666
00:52:03,746 --> 00:52:05,956
There is the other
person in the party who


667
00:52:06,040 --> 00:52:08,751
more particularly wishes to know you.


668
00:52:10,586 --> 00:52:12,588
Will you allow me to...


669
00:52:13,506 --> 00:52:18,177
Do I ask too much to introduce my sister
to you, during your stay at Lambton?


670
00:52:20,930 --> 00:52:24,099
I should be very happy to
make her acquaintance.


671
00:52:25,267 --> 00:52:26,602
Thank you.


672
00:52:42,284 --> 00:52:44,161
Thank you.


673
00:52:45,204 --> 00:52:47,790
I hope we shall meet again very soon.


674
00:52:48,165 --> 00:52:51,126
Good day, Mr Gardiner. Mrs Gardiner.


675
00:52:52,461 --> 00:52:54,338
Good day, Miss Bennet.
