1
00:00:02,342 --> 00:00:04,542
嘿 你们周末有空的话
Oh, hey, if you guys are free this weekend,

2
00:00:04,544 --> 00:00:06,378
我工作赢了一个品酒会
I won a night of wine tasting from work.

3
00:00:06,380 --> 00:00:07,879
听起来很有意思
That sounds fun. Mm-hmm.

4
00:00:07,881 --> 00:00:11,282
为什么科学家都不像销售员一样能有免费物品呢?
How come scientists don't win free stuff like salespeople do?

5
00:00:11,284 --> 00:00:12,951
因为我们不是为了物品才干这一行的
'Cause we're not in it for the stuff.

6
00:00:12,953 --> 00:00:15,654
我们是为了粉丝
We're in it for the groupies.

7
00:00:15,656 --> 00:00:16,921
就我个人而言
Personally,

8
00:00:16,923 --> 00:00:19,724
我觉得外部奖励简直看轻人
I find the notion of external rewards demeaning.

9
00:00:19,726 --> 00:00:23,028
我追求科学是为了体验发现本身的快乐
I pursue science for the intrinsic joy of discovery.

10
00:00:23,030 --> 00:00:25,930
但你总说你想获得诺贝尔奖
But you always say that you want to win a Nobel Prize.

11
00:00:25,932 --> 00:00:28,400
我还说不要在朋友们面前反驳我
I also say don't contradict me in front of my friends,

12
00:00:28,402 --> 00:00:29,668
但这个你就记不住了
but that you don't remember.

13
00:00:29,670 --> 00:00:32,737
好吧 如果你们想去告诉我
All right, well, let me know if you guys want to go.

14
00:00:32,739 --> 00:00:33,938
我想去
I would love to.

15
00:00:33,940 --> 00:00:37,075
我确实喜欢陈年的黑比诺酒的丰富
I do enjoy the complexity of an aged Pinot noir.

16
00:00:37,077 --> 00:00:38,376
我确定这个和你的
I'm sure that would pair nicely

17
00:00:38,378 --> 00:00:40,311
油炸鸡块会很搭
with your fried nuggets of chicken.

18
00:00:42,082 --> 00:00:44,182
听起来是个美妙的夜晚 我们应该去
Well, it sounds like a nice night. We should go.

19
00:00:44,184 --> 00:00:45,250
又喝酒?
Wine again?

20
00:00:45,252 --> 00:00:46,484
不了 谢谢你
Yeah, no, thank you.

21
00:00:46,486 --> 00:00:48,386
我喜欢传统形式的葡萄
I like my grapes the old-fashioned way:

22
00:00:48,388 --> 00:00:50,722
在果汁盒里
in a juice box.

23
00:00:50,724 --> 00:00:52,090
好吧 我要去的
Well, I'm going.

24
00:00:52,092 --> 00:00:54,092
你不能阻止我在商场享受按摩
You couldn't stop me from getting a massage at the mall,

25
00:00:54,094 --> 00:00:55,760
你现在也不能阻止我去
and you're not stopping me now.

26
00:00:55,762 --> 00:00:57,529
我不该看着我的女朋友
I shouldn't have to see my girlfriend

27
00:00:57,531 --> 00:00:59,364
在公共场合被其他男人摸
get groped in public by another man.

28
00:00:59,366 --> 00:01:01,933
我也不该看着我的男朋友
And I shouldn't have to see my boyfriend

29
00:01:01,935 --> 00:01:04,569
在商场坐在儿童火车上
riding on a train for children around the mall.

30
00:01:06,173 --> 00:01:08,173
给宝宝坐的小火车?
The little choo-choo for toddlers?

31
00:01:08,175 --> 00:01:10,241
你现在知道我为什么需要按摩了吧
And now you know why I needed the massage.

32
00:01:11,812 --> 00:01:13,011
我们就不去了
Well, we're out.

33
00:01:13,013 --> 00:01:14,813
Bernie不能喝酒因为她怀孕了
Bernie can't drink 'cause she's pregnant.

34
00:01:14,815 --> 00:01:16,748
她怀孕因为我们做爱了
And she's pregnant because we had sex.

35
00:01:16,750 --> 00:01:18,183
我们做爱因为...
And we had sex because...

36
00:01:18,185 --> 00:01:20,919
你懂得
well, come on.

37
00:01:21,955 --> 00:01:23,988
没关系 你应该去
It's okay. You should go.

38
00:01:23,990 --> 00:01:24,956
你确定?
You sure?

39
00:01:24,958 --> 00:01:26,157
当然
Of course.

40
00:01:26,159 --> 00:01:29,928
是的 让她休息一下 你懂得
Yeah, give her a break from, “Well, come on.”

41
00:01:31,431 --> 00:01:33,798
Bernadette 看来周六晚上只有你和我了
Well, Bernadette, looks like Saturday night, it's you and me.

42
00:01:33,800 --> 00:01:36,601
我? 怎样? 为什么?
Me? How? Why?

43
00:01:36,603 --> 00:01:38,269
很自然啊
Well, it makes perfect sense.

44
00:01:38,271 --> 00:01:41,072
你是个准妈妈 你不能喝酒
Because you're an expectant mother, you can't drink alcohol.

45
00:01:41,074 --> 00:01:42,040
我也不喜欢
I don't like too.

46
00:01:42,042 --> 00:01:43,408
你不能吃寿司
You can't have sushi.

47
00:01:43,410 --> 00:01:44,375
我也不喜欢
I don't like too.

48
00:01:44,377 --> 00:01:46,010
你不能用热水浴缸
You can't go in hot tubs.

49
00:01:46,012 --> 00:01:49,180
我觉得它是大桶的出汗人汤
I consider them vats of sweaty people soup.

50
00:01:50,250 --> 00:01:52,050
Sheldon 我不知道
Gee, Sheldon, I don't know.

51
00:01:52,052 --> 00:01:53,451
来嘛
Oh, come on.

52
00:01:53,453 --> 00:01:55,954
过山车 咖啡因 溏心蛋
Roller coasters, caffeine, runny eggs,

53
00:01:55,956 --> 00:01:57,789
我这辈子都在回避这些东西
I've been avoiding these things all my life.

54
00:01:57,791 --> 00:02:01,059
现在因为你怀孕了 你必须回避
And now, because you're pregnant, you have to.

55
00:02:01,061 --> 00:02:03,194
区别是她将生机带来这个世界
The difference is she's bringing life into the world,

56
00:02:03,196 --> 00:02:05,130
你是去除生机
and you suck it out.

57
00:02:05,966 --> 00:02:07,932
我想我们可以试一下
I guess we could give it a try.

58
00:02:07,934 --> 00:02:10,502
亲爱的小姐 你听说过丰盛的聚会
Well, little lady, you've heard of party hearty,

59
00:02:10,504 --> 00:02:13,104
准备好参加贫乏聚会
get ready to party hardly.

60
00:02:14,341 --> 00:02:16,975
我赌你现在想喝一杯
I bet you'd like a drink right now.

61
00:02:18,678 --> 00:02:22,247
* 宇宙一度又烫又稠密 *

你觉得如果我
Hey, you think it'd be okay

73
00:02:49,871 --> 00:02:51,504
带Claire去品酒会可以吗
if I brought Claire to the wine tasting?

74
00:02:51,506 --> 00:02:53,305
- 当然 我想见见她  - 太好了
- Sure. I'd like to meet her.  - Oh, that's great.

75
00:02:53,307 --> 00:02:54,974
我也一直想让她见见你们
I've been wanting her to meet you guys, too,

76
00:02:54,976 --> 00:02:56,609
这次似乎是个好机会
so this seems like the perfect opportunity.

77
00:02:56,611 --> 00:02:58,110
但我不在
Oh, but I won't be there.

78
00:02:58,112 --> 00:02:59,445
真有意思怎么办呢
Funny how that worked out.

79
00:03:00,848 --> 00:03:03,449
这意味着你和Emily分开了?
Does this mean Emily's not in the picture anymore?

80
00:03:03,451 --> 00:03:04,517
没有 我还在和她约会
No, I'm still dating her.

81
00:03:04,519 --> 00:03:05,685
给我解释一下
Okay, help me out.

82
00:03:05,687 --> 00:03:07,019
你是怎么做的?
How are you doing this?

83
00:03:07,021 --> 00:03:08,854
她们知道对方吗?
Do they know about each other?

84
00:03:08,856 --> 00:03:10,589
她们知道我们不是专一的
They know that we're not exclusive,

85
00:03:10,591 --> 00:03:12,725
还有我们不会问太多问题
and we just don't ask too many questions.

86
00:03:12,727 --> 00:03:15,361
你知道 这就像我和你一起玩卡尔战神
You know, it's like how I play Warlords of Ka'a with you

87
00:03:15,363 --> 00:03:19,131
和Frank和Alicia一起玩远古印记

Frank和Alicia是谁?
Who's Frank and Alicia?

89
00:03:21,703 --> 00:03:24,136
你和我在一起的时间很长
Y... You and I spend a lot of time together.

90
00:03:24,138 --> 00:03:26,739
就不能保持一点神秘感吗?
Can there be a little mystery between us?

91
00:03:26,741 --> 00:03:28,507
好了
Okay.

92
00:03:28,509 --> 00:03:30,276
所有装置已连接 我们准备好了
Everything's hooked up. We're ready.

93
00:03:30,278 --> 00:03:33,212
我要给后人记录下这一刻
I am going to record this for posterity.

94
00:03:33,214 --> 00:03:34,914
好 不会有什么希望
All right, here goes nothing.

95
00:03:34,916 --> 00:03:36,282
不会有什么希望?
Here goes nothing?

96
00:03:36,284 --> 00:03:37,917
这是我们构想的初始测试
This is the initial test of our prototype.

97
00:03:37,919 --> 00:03:39,518
可以稍微庄严一点吗?
Can we give it a little more gravitas?

98
00:03:39,520 --> 00:03:40,686
好吧
Fine.

99
00:03:40,688 --> 00:03:43,489

101
00:03:46,561 --> 00:03:47,927
问题可能出在你的嗓音
Eh... maybe it's your voice.

102
00:03:47,929 --> 00:03:50,763
我要看看之后能不能请James Earl Jones来念
I'm gonna see if I can get James Earl Jones to do it in post.

103
00:03:55,403 --> 00:03:56,969
哦
Ooh.

104
00:03:58,773 --> 00:04:00,473
哇哦
Wow.

105
00:04:00,475 --> 00:04:03,109
好美
It's... it's-it's beautiful.

106
00:04:05,413 --> 00:04:07,346
实际上 它搞得我头晕
Actually, it's making me dizzy.

107
00:04:07,348 --> 00:04:10,049
太好了 不仅仅是我
Good, it's not just me. 

108
00:04:15,223 --> 00:04:16,388
喂
Hello.

109
00:04:16,390 --> 00:04:17,423
嘿 Claire
Hey, Claire.

110
00:04:17,425 --> 00:04:18,390
嘿 怎么了?
Hey, what's up?

111
00:04:18,392 --> 00:04:19,125
嘿 呃
Hi, yeah.

112
00:04:19,127 --> 00:04:20,626
我在想
Um, I was wondering,

113
00:04:20,628 --> 00:04:22,795
你周末有没有空
if you're free Saturday night,

114
00:04:22,797 --> 00:04:25,097
我的朋友们都要去一个品酒会
all my friends are going to a wine tasting.

115
00:04:25,099 --> 00:04:27,500
有空 我想
Sure, I guess.

116
00:04:27,502 --> 00:04:30,169
如果你不觉得见你的朋友们对我们来说有点太快的话
If you don't think meeting your friends is too big a step.

117
00:04:30,171 --> 00:04:32,705
为什么会太快?
Why would it be too big a step?

118
00:04:32,707 --> 00:04:35,875
我不知道 我只是不想让事情变得奇怪
I don't know. I just don't want things to get weird.

119
00:04:36,744 --> 00:04:38,944
没什么好担心的
Nothing to worry about.

120
00:04:38,946 --> 00:04:40,379
人们无时无刻不在见面
People meet people all the time,

121
00:04:40,381 --> 00:04:41,847
一点都不奇怪
and it isn't weird.

122
00:04:41,849 --> 00:04:44,383
我曾经见到Bon Jovi 你觉得可能会奇怪的那个
I met Bon Jovi once, which you'd think might be weird.

123
00:04:44,385 --> 00:04:47,353
结果 非常愉快
Turns out, total sweetheart.

124
00:04:47,355 --> 00:04:51,524
好吧 但我们要顺其自然
Okay, but you and I have been keeping things casual.

125
00:04:51,526 --> 00:04:53,559
你会介绍我是你的朋友
Uh, will you introduce me as your friend

126
00:04:53,561 --> 00:04:54,727
还是女朋友
or as your girlfriend?

127
00:04:54,729 --> 00:04:56,295
如果我喜欢他们
What if I like them

128
00:04:56,297 --> 00:04:57,429
他们不喜欢我怎么办?
and they don't like me?

129
00:04:57,431 --> 00:04:59,532
如果他们喜欢我而我不喜欢他们怎么办?
What if they like me and I don't like them?

130
00:04:59,534 --> 00:05:02,368
和Bon Jovi见面那次可没这么困难
Boy, it wasn't this hard with Bon Jovi.

131
00:05:02,370 --> 00:05:04,403
我说 "你很酷" 他说 "谢谢"
I said, “You rock,” he said, “Thanks, man,”

132
00:05:04,405 --> 00:05:07,273
就完了
and that was that.

133
00:05:14,615 --> 00:05:16,015
嘿 你准备走了吗?
Hey, you ready to go?

134
00:05:16,017 --> 00:05:17,950
- 等下  - 你在干什么?
- Hang on.  - What are you doing?

135
00:05:17,952 --> 00:05:21,787
找到一本擦嗅的关于品酒的书
Oh, I found a scratch-and-sniff book about wine tasting.

136
00:05:22,824 --> 00:05:24,957
讲授寻找红酒的不同风味
It teaches the different flavor notes to look for.

137
00:05:24,959 --> 00:05:26,559
你真的闻到酒味了?
You actually smell the wine?

138
00:05:26,561 --> 00:05:29,128
基本上是我的鼻用喷雾的味道
I mostly just smell my nasal spray.

139
00:05:29,130 --> 00:05:31,197
你的鼻炎又发作了?
Are your sinuses acting up?

140
00:05:31,199 --> 00:05:32,898
自从我在幼儿园得到一只兔子
Since my preschool got a bunny.

141
00:05:32,900 --> 00:05:35,935
你今晚还是和Bernadette一起玩吗?
Hey, are you still hanging out with Bernadette tonight?

142
00:05:35,937 --> 00:05:37,269
是呀
Yes.

143
00:05:37,271 --> 00:05:39,305
我们要证明我们不需要酒精
And we're going to prove that we don't need alcohol

144
00:05:39,307 --> 00:05:40,339
就可以玩得很开心
to enjoy ourselves.

145
00:05:40,341 --> 00:05:41,674

也没有泡泡浴
Oh, no bubble baths either.

151
00:05:53,688 --> 00:05:55,821
他们会增加尿路感染的危险
They can increase the risk of a urinary tract infection.

152
00:05:55,823 --> 00:05:57,089

我都不记得上次我们单独
You know, I don't remember the last time

169
00:06:36,030 --> 00:06:37,796
相处是什么时候了
it was just you and me hanging out.

170
00:06:37,798 --> 00:06:40,766
我记得 三年前
Oh, I do. It was three years ago.

171
00:06:40,768 --> 00:06:44,203
对哦 当时我们说要常玩的
Oh, yeah, and we said we should do it more often.

172
00:06:44,205 --> 00:06:46,939
然后... 就到现在了
And... and here we are.

173
00:06:54,649 --> 00:06:56,682
所以Sheldon和Bernadette在一起玩
So, Sheldon and Bernadette are hanging out.

174
00:06:56,684 --> 00:07:00,052
是啊 他们会聊些什么呢?
I know. What are they gonna talk about?

175
00:07:01,522 --> 00:07:03,622
我不知道
I don't know.

176
00:07:03,624 --> 00:07:06,992
真的不知道呀
I really don't know.

177
00:07:06,994 --> 00:07:07,927
嘿
Hey.

178
00:07:07,929 --> 00:07:09,495
- 太好了!  - 谢天谢地!

179
00:07:09,497 --> 00:07:11,764
你们来很久了吗?
You guys been here long?

00:07:11,766 --> 00:07:12,798
没 就两分钟
No, two minutes.

181
00:07:12,800 --> 00:07:15,601
但度秒如年
But yes.

182
00:07:15,603 --> 00:07:16,635
Claire呢?
Where's Claire?

哦 她直接来这里跟我们见面
Oh, she's meeting us here.

184
00:07:18,072 --> 00:07:20,339
各位 帮个忙别问太多关于
Hey, guys, do me a favor and don't ask too many questions

185
00:07:20,341 --> 00:07:21,307
我们关系的问题
about the relationship.

186
00:07:21,309 --> 00:07:22,875
我们在慢慢来
We're just keeping it casual.

187
00:07:22,877 --> 00:07:25,611
所以我不应该问她作为你妻妾的一员
Oh, so I shouldn't ask her how she feels about being

188
00:07:25,613 --> 00:07:27,780
有何感受咯?
a member of your harem?

189
00:07:27,782 --> 00:07:30,849
我知道你在打趣 但小心遭报应
Yeah, I know you're teasing, but watch out for karma.

190
00:07:30,851 --> 00:07:33,585
嘿 Penny 那不是你前男友Zack吗?
Hey, Penny, isn't that your old boyfriend Zack?

191
00:07:33,587 --> 00:07:35,654
是哦
Oh, yeah.

192
00:07:35,656 --> 00:07:37,122
你要跟他打招呼吗?
Are you gonna say hi to him?

193
00:07:37,124 --> 00:07:38,257
不知道哎
Uh, I don't know.

194
00:07:38,259 --> 00:07:39,258
在你做决定的空当
Hey, while you decide,

195
00:07:39,260 --> 00:07:40,526
谁床上功夫更好呢:
who was better in bed:

196
00:07:40,528 --> 00:07:43,963
大帅哥Zack还是小喘男Leonard?
big hot Zack or wheezy little Leonard?

197
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:49,101
哩哩啦啦
Neener neener.

198
00:07:50,271 --> 00:07:51,870
我带了气泡苹果汁
I brought sparkling cider.

199
00:07:51,872 --> 00:07:55,074
哦... 泡泡搞得我鼻子痒
Oh... the bubbles tickle my nose.

200
00:07:55,076 --> 00:07:57,509
我还是现在就打开
I'll just open this now so it can get

201
00:07:57,511 --> 00:08:00,112
这样喝的时候就没有气泡更爽口了
nice and flat before we drink it.

202
00:08:00,114 --> 00:08:02,114
你今晚想干什么?
So what do you want to do tonight?

203
00:08:02,116 --> 00:08:04,350
哦 我可是好好规划了一番呢
Oh, I have quite the evening planned.

204
00:08:04,352 --> 00:08:07,653
我们的胎儿友好欢乐节始于
Our fetus-friendly festival of fun begins

205
00:08:07,655 --> 00:08:08,954
对模型火车世界的
with an in-depth look

206
00:08:08,956 --> 00:08:10,889
深入了解
at the world of model trains,

207
00:08:10,891 --> 00:08:13,192
然后我们会加大欢乐力度
and then we'll kick things up a notch and explore

208
00:08:13,194 --> 00:08:16,328
探索烤吐司的不同方式
all the different ways that you can make toast.

209
00:08:16,330 --> 00:08:18,297
难道不止一种?
There's more than one?

210
00:08:19,166 --> 00:08:21,133
- 你听过法国吐司吗?  - 嗯
- You've heard of French toast?  - Yeah.

211
00:08:21,135 --> 00:08:22,401
- 肉桂吐司?  - 嗯
- Cinnamon toast?  - Yeah.

212
00:08:22,403 --> 00:08:23,635
- 梅尔巴吐司?  - 嗯
- Melba toast?  - Yeah.

213
00:08:23,637 --> 00:08:25,871
你明白我意思了吗?
You get where I'm going here?

214
00:08:25,873 --> 00:08:28,374
嗯
Yeah.

215
00:08:30,478 --> 00:08:33,312
我闻到了泥土的味道
I'm getting an earthy note.

216
00:08:33,314 --> 00:08:35,247
绝对有橡树
Ah, there's definitely some oak.

217
00:08:35,249 --> 00:08:37,516
还有 樱桃?
Also, uh, cherries?

218
00:08:37,518 --> 00:08:39,451
我什么也没闻到
I smell nothing.

219
00:08:40,755 --> 00:08:43,022
真的? 什么也没有?
Really? Nothing?

220
00:08:43,024 --> 00:08:46,625
就... 很浓的阿氟林味儿
Just a... whole lot of Afrin.

221
00:08:46,627 --> 00:08:48,360
Penny是你?
Penny?

222
00:08:48,362 --> 00:08:49,595
你好 Zack!
Oh. Zack, hi!

223
00:08:49,597 --> 00:08:50,863
你们都记得Zack吧
You guys remember Zack.

224
00:08:50,865 --> 00:08:51,997
- 嗯 你好  - 你好  - 嘿
- Yeah, hey, buddy.  - Hello.  - Hey.

225
00:08:51,999 --> 00:08:53,866
你们俩结婚了吗?
Hey, did you two get married?

226
00:08:53,868 --> 00:08:55,167
- 是的  - 嗯
- We did.  - Yeah, mm-hmm.

227
00:08:55,169 --> 00:08:57,403
和对方?
To each other?

228
00:08:58,672 --> 00:09:00,105
对
Yes. 

229
00:09:00,107 --> 00:09:02,307
挺好 因为除了你跟他分手
Cool. 'Cause other than when you broke up with him

230
00:09:02,309 --> 00:09:04,009
和我在一起 然后和我分手
and dated me, then broke up with me,

231
00:09:04,011 --> 00:09:06,945
再和我在一起 然后跟他复合之外
and then dated me one more time before going back to him,

232
00:09:06,947 --> 00:09:08,914
我都一直支持你们俩的
I was always rooting for you two.

233
00:09:08,916 --> 00:09:10,549
谢谢
Thanks.

234
00:09:10,551 --> 00:09:12,051
科研怎么样了?
So how's the science world?

235
00:09:12,053 --> 00:09:13,485
你们研究什么呢?
What are you guys up to?

236
00:09:13,487 --> 00:09:15,888
我们在为自己发明的导航系统
W-We've actually been working on a prototype

237
00:09:15,890 --> 00:09:17,423
研发模型
for a navigation system we invented.

238
00:09:17,425 --> 00:09:19,224
但我们就不拿细节烦你了
But we won't bore you with the details.

239
00:09:19,226 --> 00:09:21,393
开玩笑吗? 我爱科学
Are you kidding? I love science.

240
00:09:21,395 --> 00:09:24,997
爱因斯坦 斯蒂芬·霍金 迈克·德葛拉司·泰森(实为奈尔·德葛拉司·泰森 天文学家)
Einstein, Stephen Hawking, Mike deGrasse Tyson.

241
00:09:25,866 --> 00:09:28,000
迈克·德葛拉司·泰森?
Mike deGrasse Tyson?

242
00:09:28,002 --> 00:09:30,702
对啊 就是那个拳击手(拳王泰森)留了胡子
Yeah, you know, the boxer who grew a mustache

243
00:09:30,704 --> 00:09:33,305
当起科学家了
and became a scientist.

244
00:09:33,307 --> 00:09:34,573
你们的发明是什么?
So what's your invention?

245
00:09:34,575 --> 00:09:37,776
我们要用量子漩涡
Well, we're using quantum vortices

246
00:09:37,778 --> 00:09:39,978
来代替导航系统中的陀螺仪
to replace gyroscopes in guidance systems.

247
00:09:39,980 --> 00:09:41,680
妙的是它们可以永久
What's neat is that they can maintain

248
00:09:41,682 --> 00:09:43,348
维持角动量
angular momentum indefinitely.

249
00:09:43,350 --> 00:09:45,551
角动量哈
Angular momentum.

250
00:09:45,553 --> 00:09:48,020
我正想它呢
I was wondering about that.

251
00:09:48,022 --> 00:09:51,790
你可以把它装在卫星或火箭上
You could put it in a satellite or a rocket,

252
00:09:51,792 --> 00:09:53,559
它就会一直运行下去
and it'll run forever.

253
00:09:53,561 --> 00:09:54,827
厉害啊
Cool.

254
00:09:54,829 --> 00:09:57,196
它可以被用于导弹或战争中吗?
Could it be used for missiles and war stuff?

255
00:09:57,198 --> 00:10:00,432
可以 但我们不是想造武器啊
Yeah, but we didn't create it for weapons.

256
00:10:00,434 --> 00:10:02,434
而且我也怀疑军方会对我们的
And I doubt the military would be interested

257
00:10:02,436 --> 00:10:03,802
小小导航系统感兴趣
in our little guidance system.

258
00:10:03,804 --> 00:10:05,404
它比军方现在用的好吗?
Is it better than the one they use now?

259
00:10:05,406 --> 00:10:08,207
- 好太多!  - 没得比
- A lot!  - Way better.

260
00:10:08,209 --> 00:10:09,942
哈
Huh.

261
00:10:09,944 --> 00:10:12,478
你确定你们聪明吗?
You sure you guys are smart?

262
00:10:21,118 --> 00:10:24,586
"H-O"规格的火车是1:87的比例
"H-O" gauge trains are 1/87 scale.

263
00:10:24,588 --> 00:10:27,789
"N"规格的是1:160的比例
"N" gauge are 1/160 scale.

264
00:10:27,791 --> 00:10:30,459
然后就到了"Z"规格 它的是
And that brings us to "Z" gauge, at a

265
00:10:30,461 --> 00:10:35,264
"你可以轻易吞到肚子里 别问我怎么知道的"规格 比例1:200
"you could easily swallow it, don't ask how I know," 1/220.

266
00:10:35,266 --> 00:10:37,432
抱歉 我还是得问
I'm sorry, I have to ask.

267
00:10:37,434 --> 00:10:40,569
我五岁的时候 吞下了一个"Z"规格的火车
When I was five, I ingested a "Z" gauge locomotive.

268
00:10:40,571 --> 00:10:43,005
我接下来三天都在说 "我能拉出来
I spent the next three days saying, "I think I can pass it,

269
00:10:43,007 --> 00:10:46,742
我能拉出来 我能拉出来"
I think I can pass it, I think I can pass it."

270
00:10:48,212 --> 00:10:50,979
你为什么这么喜欢火车?
What is it about trains that you like so much?

271
00:10:50,981 --> 00:10:53,148
这问题有意思
What an interesting question.

272
00:10:53,150 --> 00:10:56,118
我小的时候 生活对我来说
When I was a child, life was confusing

273
00:10:56,120 --> 00:10:59,121
困惑又混乱 而火车代表着秩序
and chaotic for me, and trains represented order.

274
00:10:59,123 --> 00:11:03,158
我可以给它们排队 分类 控制它们
I could line them up, categorize them, control them.

275
00:11:03,160 --> 00:11:04,660
我想你可以说
I guess you could say that

276
00:11:04,662 --> 00:11:08,096
它们在纷扰的世界中给了我一丝平静
they gave me a sense of calm in a world that didn't.

277
00:11:08,098 --> 00:11:10,165
说的太好了 Sheldon
That's lovely, Sheldon.

278
00:11:10,167 --> 00:11:12,868
嗯... 除了一点点驶过你肚子的时候之外
Well... other than when they're chugging through your bowels,

279
00:11:12,870 --> 00:11:14,703
这些东西充满魔力
these things are magic.

280
00:11:17,708 --> 00:11:19,675
我必须承认 从我们开始讨论这个开始
I have to admit, I've been worried about

281
00:11:19,677 --> 00:11:22,678
我一直在担心军方应用
the military applications since we started talking about this.

282
00:11:22,680 --> 00:11:24,046
我也是
Me, too.

283
00:11:24,048 --> 00:11:25,380
你怎么不说啊?
Why didn't you say something?

284
00:11:25,382 --> 00:11:27,816
跟我不讨论肛门癌的原因一样
Same reason I don't talk about ass cancer.

285
00:11:27,818 --> 00:11:30,786
这不是什么愉快的话题
It's not a pleasant topic.

286
00:11:30,788 --> 00:11:32,354
你不能让这个阻止你们
You can't let this stop you.

287
00:11:32,356 --> 00:11:34,389
几乎所有的科学发展都可以被用在
Almost any scientific advancement can be used

288
00:11:34,391 --> 00:11:36,091
毁灭性的事情上
for destructive purposes.

289
00:11:36,093 --> 00:11:38,126
没错 就连爱因斯坦的相对论
It's true. Even Einstein's theory of relativity

290
00:11:38,128 --> 00:11:40,796
之后也被用在了核武器的研发上
was later applied to the development of nuclear weapons.

291
00:11:40,798 --> 00:11:42,631
E等于MC的平方(爱因斯坦著名的相对论公式)
E equals MC squared.

292
00:11:42,633 --> 00:11:43,999
是啊
Yeah.

293
00:11:44,001 --> 00:11:45,334
"E"是能量 "M"是质量
"E" is for energy, "M" for mass,

294
00:11:45,336 --> 00:11:46,768
而"C"是光速
and "C" for the speed of light.

295
00:11:48,939 --> 00:11:50,505
你怎么知道的?
How do you know that?

296
00:11:50,507 --> 00:11:54,109
Leonard想延长做爱时间的时候就嘟囔这些
Oh, Leonard mumbles it when he wants sex to last longer.

297
00:11:57,214 --> 00:11:58,180
嘿 Raj
Hey, Raj.

298
00:11:58,182 --> 00:12:00,248
嘿 Claire 你来了太好了
Hey, Claire. Good, you're here.

299
00:12:00,250 --> 00:12:02,117
各位 这是我的朋友Claire
Guys, this is my friend Claire.

300
00:12:02,119 --> 00:12:04,319
我们在非正式地交往 然后没有必要
We're casually dating, and there's no need

301
00:12:04,321 --> 00:12:06,755
问任何问题了
for any further questions about it.

302
00:12:07,524 --> 00:12:09,825
你想喝杯酒吗?
Would you like a glass of wine?

303
00:12:09,827 --> 00:12:11,593
说了不许问问题!
I said no questions!

304
00:12:13,697 --> 00:12:15,931
最后一个重要嘉宾
And last but not least,

305
00:12:15,933 --> 00:12:19,935
我喜欢称之为星球大战吐司 因为...
this is one that I like to call Star Wars Toast because...

306
00:12:19,937 --> 00:12:24,272
它有光明面和黑暗面
it has a light side and a dark side.

307
00:12:26,977 --> 00:12:29,277
好了 地下城与勇士的时间到了!
All righty, it's time for Dungeons & Dragons!

308
00:12:29,279 --> 00:12:31,647
地下城与勇士
Dungeons & Dragons.

309
00:12:31,649 --> 00:12:32,981
听着很"好玩"啊
That sounds about right.

310
00:12:32,983 --> 00:12:35,517
你会喜欢的
You're gonna enjoy this.

311
00:12:35,519 --> 00:12:38,253
我专门为你设计的
I designed it especially for you.

312
00:12:38,255 --> 00:12:39,888
好吧 但就玩一会儿
Okay, but just for a little bit.

313
00:12:39,890 --> 00:12:41,590
哦 我预感你一旦开始了
Oh, I have a feeling that once you start,

314
00:12:41,592 --> 00:12:44,393
你就不想停下 也不准停下
you're not gonna want to or be allowed to stop.

315
00:12:44,395 --> 00:12:47,229
好吧
All right.

316
00:12:47,231 --> 00:12:48,230
准备好了吗?
Ready?

317
00:12:48,232 --> 00:12:49,998
当然了
You bet.

318
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:51,633
你叫作
Your name is

319
00:12:51,635 --> 00:12:52,734
Bernatrix.
Bernatrix

320
00:12:52,736 --> 00:12:54,036
你是战士女王
You are a warrior queen.

321
00:12:54,038 --> 00:12:56,905
你又强又高又漂亮
You're strong, beautiful and tall.

322
00:12:56,907 --> 00:13:00,709
我喜欢长得高
Oh. I like the idea of being tall.

323
00:13:00,711 --> 00:13:03,145
我觉得有不少你喜欢的设定
I think you're gonna like a lot of things I have in store.

324
00:13:03,147 --> 00:13:05,747
例如 在这个世界里 只有男人才会怀孕
For example, in this world, only the men get pregnant,

325
00:13:05,749 --> 00:13:10,485
所以你老公在家里笑的时候要忍住不尿出来
so your husband is home trying not to pee when he laughs.

326
00:13:10,487 --> 00:13:12,454
开始变得有趣了 接下来呢?
This is getting fun. What's next?

327
00:13:12,456 --> 00:13:14,623
你又渴又倦的从战场归来
You're parched and weary from battle.

328
00:13:14,625 --> 00:13:17,893
站在一个旅馆前 旅馆里有全国
You stand in front of a tavern that serves the coldest,

329
00:13:17,895 --> 00:13:20,195
最冰凉最可口的麦芽酒
most delicious ale in all the realm.

330
00:13:20,197 --> 00:13:22,564
我好几个月没喝酒了
Oh, I haven't had a drink in months.

331
00:13:22,566 --> 00:13:24,299
你会干什么?
What do you do?

332
00:13:24,301 --> 00:13:27,302
我飞速跑进去 把剑扔在地上
I storm in, slam my sword down,

333
00:13:27,304 --> 00:13:29,838
然后说 小二 把店里最烈的麦芽酒
and say, “Barkeep, bring me the strongest ale you have

334
00:13:29,840 --> 00:13:32,174
装在哥布林的头颅里给老娘端上来!
and serve it in the skull of a goblin!”

335
00:13:35,112 --> 00:13:37,679
他要查你身份证
He wants to see I.D.

336
00:13:40,384 --> 00:13:43,552
Claire 我们听说了不少关于你的有趣的事情
So, Claire, we've heard so many wonderful things about you.

337
00:13:43,554 --> 00:13:46,054
真的? 比如呢?
Really? Like what?

338
00:13:48,092 --> 00:13:50,358
呃 主要是Penny听说的
Uh, mostly Penny's heard them.

339
00:13:52,196 --> 00:13:54,930
你去那边要求酒里加冰的时候
Boy, you get some dirty looks over there

340
00:13:54,932 --> 00:13:56,965
得看不少脸色
when you ask for ice.

341
00:13:57,735 --> 00:14:00,335
Zack 这是我朋友Claire
Zack, this is my friend Claire.

342
00:14:00,337 --> 00:14:02,838
你条子真正 有男朋友了吗?
You're hot. You seeing anybody?

343
00:14:02,840 --> 00:14:04,940
我就是她男朋友
Uh, she's seeing me.

344
00:14:04,942 --> 00:14:06,174
那你为什么说她只是你朋友?
Why'd you say she's your friend?

345
00:14:06,176 --> 00:14:07,409
我们只是想随便一点
We're just keeping it casual.

346
00:14:07,411 --> 00:14:09,644
为什么他要跟你随便? 你很不错
Why is he being casual with you? You seem great.

347
00:14:09,646 --> 00:14:11,046
我也不知道 问他
I don't know. Ask him.

348
00:14:11,048 --> 00:14:13,415
为什么你要跟他随便? 她很不错
Why are you being casual with her? She seems great.

349
00:14:21,358 --> 00:14:23,725
也许我们该后退一步
Maybe we should take a step back.

350
00:14:23,727 --> 00:14:25,260
后退一步?
Take a step back?

351
00:14:25,262 --> 00:14:27,362
我可不是年轻人了
I'm not a young man anymore.

352
00:14:28,766 --> 00:14:32,267
不 我是说重新考量该拿导航系统怎么办
No, I mean reevaluate what we're doing with the guidance system.

353
00:14:32,269 --> 00:14:34,836
可我要当爹了
But I got a baby on the way.

354
00:14:34,838 --> 00:14:36,404
我得赚钱
I got to make some money.

355
00:14:36,406 --> 00:14:37,939
如果我们不小心导致了世界末日
What good is money gonna do

356
00:14:37,941 --> 00:14:39,641
那钱又有什么用?
if we inadvertently bring about Armageddon?

357
00:14:39,643 --> 00:14:41,409
得了 我跟你讲
Okay, let me stop you right there.

358
00:14:41,411 --> 00:14:42,644
我们绝对有把握
We absolutely know

359
00:14:42,646 --> 00:14:45,747
我们的发明不会用来毁灭世界
our invention will not be used to destroy the world.

360
00:14:45,749 --> 00:14:46,815
怎么说?
How?

361
00:14:46,817 --> 00:14:48,183
因为没人从未来返回来
Because no one from the future

362
00:14:48,185 --> 00:14:50,318
刺杀我们
has come back to kill us.

363
00:14:52,156 --> 00:14:53,522
很有意思
Very funny.

364
00:14:53,524 --> 00:14:54,956
还有更好的理由吗?
You got something better?

365
00:14:54,958 --> 00:14:56,291
呃 没了
Well, not really.

366
00:14:56,293 --> 00:14:57,893
好吧 那么
Okay, then.

367
00:15:03,200 --> 00:15:05,066
天啊 你究竟喝了多少酒?
Geez, how much wine did you drink?

368
00:15:05,068 --> 00:15:08,804
没多少 直到你走开我才尿得出来
Not a lot. I just couldn't start until you walked away.

369
00:15:12,176 --> 00:15:14,876
地狱虾从温泉里冲出来!
The Hell Prawn lunges out of the hot spring!

370
00:15:15,879 --> 00:15:18,180
你用盾格挡开
You block it with your shield.

371
00:15:18,182 --> 00:15:19,181
你要反击吗?
Do you attack?

372
00:15:19,183 --> 00:15:20,315
它有眼睛吗?
Does it have eyes?

373
00:15:20,317 --> 00:15:22,851
三个血红的大眼睛都不眨一下
Three giant red ones and they never blink.

374
00:15:22,853 --> 00:15:24,486
看着瘆人
It's unsettling.

375
00:15:24,488 --> 00:15:27,022
我捅向中间的眼睛!
I stab it in the middle eye!

376
00:15:28,325 --> 00:15:29,324
好办法!
Good choice!

377
00:15:29,326 --> 00:15:30,926
暴击了! 你的剑
Critical hit! Your sword goes

378
00:15:30,928 --> 00:15:33,094
刺穿它的眼睛插入脑子里
through its eye into its tiny brain.

379
00:15:33,096 --> 00:15:35,397
它用最后一口气说
With its final dying gasp, it says,

380
00:15:35,399 --> 00:15:36,932
你把我
You have reduced me

381
00:15:36,934 --> 00:15:38,867
做成了一块寿司
“to a pile of sushi.

382
00:15:38,869 --> 00:15:40,535
伴着酱油食用
“Enjoy me

383
00:15:40,537 --> 00:15:43,471
风味更佳
“with this packet of soy sauce.

384
00:15:43,473 --> 00:15:46,141
这是低钠酱油
It's low sodium.” 

385
00:15:47,845 --> 00:15:49,911
好吧 我想我要吃了地狱虾
Okay, I guess I should eat the Hell Prawn.

386
00:15:49,913 --> 00:15:50,879
你用剑
Using your sword,

387
00:15:50,881 --> 00:15:53,181
做成了好看的寿司大餐
you prepare a beautiful sushi dinner.

388
00:15:53,183 --> 00:15:56,351
你跳进温泉 热水抚慰
You slip into the hot spring and enjoy the warm water

389
00:15:56,353 --> 00:15:57,485
你酸痛的关节
on your aching joints.

390
00:15:57,487 --> 00:15:58,753
你幸福的闭上眼
As you happily close your eyes,

391
00:15:58,755 --> 00:16:01,056
想起那个愉快的晚上
you recall the incredible evening you've had

392
00:16:01,058 --> 00:16:02,490
注意到
and notice that your...

393
00:16:03,894 --> 00:16:08,263
你的脚和脚踝变得比以前都小了
feet and ankles are smaller than they've ever been.

394
00:16:08,265 --> 00:16:09,931
全剧终
The end.

395
00:16:09,933 --> 00:16:13,702
今晚比我预想的有意思多了
Wow, this night turned out to be so much more fun than I thought.

396
00:16:13,704 --> 00:16:15,036
还没完呢
Oh, the fun doesn't stop.

397
00:16:15,038 --> 00:16:17,505
你回家时还能带走一整袋烤面包
You're still going home with a goodie bag full of toast.

398
00:16:20,777 --> 00:16:22,477
谢谢你
Thank you for this.

399
00:16:22,479 --> 00:16:25,180
自从别人知道我怀孕了
You know, ever since people found out I'm having a baby,

400
00:16:25,182 --> 00:16:27,983
他们都拿我当孕妇
I feel like I became Pregnant Bernadette.

401
00:16:27,985 --> 00:16:30,118
今晚能休息一下很舒服
It was nice to take a little break tonight.

402
00:16:30,120 --> 00:16:32,254
我能理解
I can understand that.

403
00:16:32,256 --> 00:16:34,623
自从人们发现我是天才
From the moment people realized I was a genius,

404
00:16:34,625 --> 00:16:36,424
我就成了天才Sheldon
I've been Sheldon the Genius.

405
00:16:38,328 --> 00:16:40,161
但是我从没想要休息一下
Although I've never really wanted a break from that,

406
00:16:40,163 --> 00:16:41,796
所以我也未必理解
so I suppose I don't understand.

407
00:16:41,798 --> 00:16:43,531
可笑的是
Which is ironic

408
00:16:43,533 --> 00:16:45,533
你知道 我是天才
'cause, you know, genius.

409
00:16:47,738 --> 00:16:49,537
好了 再次谢谢你
Well, thanks again.

410
00:16:49,539 --> 00:16:50,639
没事
You're welcome.

411
00:16:50,641 --> 00:16:52,073
每当你想从孕妇Bernadette 
And any time you need a break

412
00:16:52,075 --> 00:16:53,475
跳脱出来休息一会
from being Bernadette the Pregnant,

413
00:16:53,477 --> 00:16:55,677
随时都能变成战士女王Bernatrix 
Bernatrix the Warrior Queen is here waiting.

414
00:16:55,679 --> 00:16:57,646
我会记住你说的
I might just take you up on that.

415
00:16:57,648 --> 00:16:58,980
你得记住
Well, mind you now,

416
00:16:58,982 --> 00:17:01,416
妊娠三期之前才能来玩
that offer's only good until the third trimester.

417
00:17:01,418 --> 00:17:05,153
我可受不了羊水洒在我的座位上
I can't risk getting amniotic fluid on my spot.

418
00:17:07,257 --> 00:17:10,692
伙计 关于Claire你让我很为难
Hey, dude, you're killing me with Claire.

419
00:17:10,694 --> 00:17:11,760
你说什么呢?
What are you talking about?

420
00:17:11,762 --> 00:17:14,329
我是说 看看你
I mean, come on, look at you.

421
00:17:14,331 --> 00:17:17,365
你又帅 又有游泳运动员的身材
You're classically handsome, you've got a swimmer's body.

422
00:17:17,367 --> 00:17:20,568
在你旁边 我看起来很挫
Next to you, I look like me.

423
00:17:20,570 --> 00:17:23,638
抱歉 我不是故意的
Oh, man, I didn't mean to do that.

424
00:17:23,640 --> 00:17:26,675
但是你夸赞我游泳运动员的身材让我很爽
But I do appreciate you recognizing my swimmer's body.

425
00:17:26,677 --> 00:17:28,910
随便说一句
Which, incidentally,

426
00:17:28,912 --> 00:17:31,980
这是我在基督教青年会里玩马可波罗游戏时练出来的
I got from playing Marco Polo at the YMCA.

427
00:17:34,017 --> 00:17:36,751
好了 帮帮忙
Yeah, okay, just... do me a favor

428
00:17:36,753 --> 00:17:39,554
别再恭维Claire了
and stop talking about how great Claire is.

429
00:17:39,556 --> 00:17:42,724
乐意效劳 我的外国小朋友
Anything for you, my little foreign friend.

430
00:17:43,961 --> 00:17:45,360
我得问问
So, I got to ask,

431
00:17:45,362 --> 00:17:47,429
Raj带其他女孩来了吗?
does Raj bring around other girls?

432
00:17:48,298 --> 00:17:49,798
你知道
Uh, you know,

433
00:17:49,800 --> 00:17:52,000
我知道的不多
I... I'm not really around that much.

434
00:17:52,002 --> 00:17:54,035
Amy了解的比我清楚
Amy knows much more than I do.

435
00:17:55,439 --> 00:17:57,172
我不觉得你有什么好担心的
I don't think you have anything to worry about.

436
00:17:57,174 --> 00:17:59,841
Raj是个好小伙 对恋人忠诚
Raj is a terrific guy, loyal to a fault.

437
00:17:59,843 --> 00:18:03,011
他还有美国在线地址
Yeah. He still has an AOL address.

438
00:18:04,381 --> 00:18:05,914
我明白你说的
I see what you're saying.

439
00:18:05,916 --> 00:18:08,917
她没那么好
She's not so great.

440
00:18:12,756 --> 00:18:14,656
别听他的
Don't listen to him.

441
00:18:14,658 --> 00:18:16,524
他总是胡说八道
He says crazy things all the time.

442
00:18:16,526 --> 00:18:17,525
你看 马克
Uh, watch. Marco.

443
00:18:17,527 --> 00:18:19,260
波罗!
Polo!

444
00:18:21,164 --> 00:18:24,299
你们聊什么呢?
So, uh, what are you guys talking about?

445
00:18:24,301 --> 00:18:26,267
你朋友在跟我讲
Your friends were just telling me about

446
00:18:26,269 --> 00:18:27,869
你交往的其它女孩
all the other girls you're dating.

447
00:18:27,871 --> 00:18:30,305
你们为什么要这么干?
Why would you do that?

448
00:18:30,307 --> 00:18:32,974
我特意交代过别这样
I specifically asked you not to do that.

449
00:18:32,976 --> 00:18:34,242
我们没有啊
We didn't.

450
00:18:34,244 --> 00:18:35,510
你自己刚承认了
You just did.

451
00:18:38,048 --> 00:18:41,549
哇 或许你们都不是聪明人
Wow. Maybe none of you guys are smart.

452
00:18:51,759 --> 00:18:53,825
早
Morning.

453
00:18:53,827 --> 00:18:55,026
早
Morning.

454
00:18:55,028 --> 00:18:57,060
喝太多酒了
Ugh. Too much wine.

455
00:18:57,061 --> 00:18:58,327
我昨晚
Oh, I overdid it

456
00:18:58,329 --> 00:18:59,628
也过头了
