<i>Lynette made a promise.</i>

00:00:11,502 --> 00:00:12,502
His wife goes missing 
and his mistress turns up dead?

5
00:00:11,100 --> 00:00:13,400
I just can't believe that
Orson could do such a thing.

<i>Mike got arrested...</i>

7
00:00:14,800 --> 00:00:17,300
Oh, thank God!
- <i>and a friendship hit the rocks.</i>

8
00:00:17,300 --> 00:00:19,800
I am not playing with a woman
that is willing to let Mike

9
00:00:19,800 --> 00:00:21,000
take the fall for her psycho husband.

10
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:22,300

13

14

Hello, Alma.

15
00:00:34,200 --> 00:00:37,100
<i><i>(Mary Alice)</i> To understand
the journey of Alma Hodge,</i>

16
00:00:37,200 --> 00:00:40,700
<i>you first need to know
how it started.</i>

17
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:44,500
<i>It began the day
she wed Orson Hodge,</i>

18
00:00:44,600 --> 00:00:47,300
<i>a man she had
tricked into marriage</i>

19
00:00:47,300 --> 00:00:49,500
<i>by getting pregnant.</i>

20
00:00:49,500 --> 00:00:53,200
<i>Alma was confident
that as their family grew,</i>

21
00:00:53,300 --> 00:00:55,900
<i>Orson's feelings for her
would grow as well.</i>

22
00:00:57,000 --> 00:00:59,300
<i>But then
something went wrong,</i>

23
00:01:00,200 --> 00:01:04,100
<i>and the baby she had been
counting on never came.</i>

24
00:01:05,100 --> 00:01:08,200
<i>So Alma found herself
married to a man</i>

25
00:01:09,300 --> 00:01:11,100
<i>who seemed to despise her.</i>

26
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:16,300
<i>Still, Alma hoped
things would get better...</i>

27
00:01:16,800 --> 00:01:20,500
Mama loves her baby.
Does the baby love mama?

28
00:01:20,500 --> 00:01:22,400
<i>until the day she discovered</i>

29
00:01:22,400 --> 00:01:26,700
<i>Orson was having an affair.</i>

30
00:01:26,700 --> 00:01:28,400
<i>And Alma realized</i>

31
00:01:28,400 --> 00:01:31,900
<i>the only way she'd ever get
her husband to appreciate her</i>

32
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:33,900
<i>was to leave him...</i>

33
00:01:34,700 --> 00:01:36,400
<i>immediately.</i>

34
00:01:47,100 --> 00:01:49,400
If you don't get back
in your cage right now,

35
00:01:49,500 --> 00:01:52,600
I'm gonna have
to leave you behind. Please!

36
00:02:13,800 --> 00:02:14,900
Going somewhere?

37
00:02:15,700 --> 00:02:17,600
I'm staying
at a motel tonight.

38
00:02:19,500 --> 00:02:20,600
Why?

39
00:02:20,800 --> 00:02:23,700
I don't have time to discuss it.
I'm late for the bus.

40
00:02:25,800 --> 00:02:26,400
All right.

41
00:02:35,700 --> 00:02:37,500
I'm going away because...

42
00:02:37,700 --> 00:02:40,500
I know you're having
an affair.

43
00:02:40,500 --> 00:02:42,400
Ah. I see.

44
00:02:42,400 --> 00:02:45,500
Aren't you even
gonna deny it?

45
00:02:45,500 --> 00:02:47,500
On the contrary.

46
00:02:47,500 --> 00:02:50,100
I wanna shout it
from the rooftops!

47
00:02:50,100 --> 00:02:53,400
For the first time in my life,
I'm actually in love.

48
00:02:53,400 --> 00:02:56,500
How can you say that to me?
I'm your wife!

49
00:02:56,500 --> 00:02:59,200
We both know
why we got married,

50
00:03:00,100 --> 00:03:02,600
and it had nothing
to do with affection.

51
00:03:02,600 --> 00:03:05,700
So you don't care if I go?

52
00:03:06,900 --> 00:03:07,900
No.

53
00:03:13,400 --> 00:03:15,900
Wait! This isn't
what's supposed to happen!

54
00:03:15,900 --> 00:03:18,000
You should be begging me
to stay with you.

55
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:20,800
I deserve to be happy, Alma.
So do you.

56
00:03:21,100 --> 00:03:23,700
And we're clearly
not gonna find that together.

57
00:03:23,900 --> 00:03:25,800
Orson, no!

You're kidding. When?

75
00:05:08,100 --> 00:05:11,000
Yesterday.
I'm so disappointed in her.

76
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:12,700
well, the police
did arrest Mike.

77
00:05:12,700 --> 00:05:14,700
I mean, I know
you think he's innocent,

78
00:05:14,700 --> 00:05:15,800
but surely you can understand

79
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:17,600
why Bree's feelings
have changed.

80
00:05:17,900 --> 00:05:18,800
Well, mine haven't,

81
00:05:19,100 --> 00:05:21,800
and I know something
that Bree probably doesn't.

82
00:05:25,700 --> 00:05:28,400
When Orson was 17,

83
00:05:29,300 --> 00:05:31,400
he spent time
in a mental institution.

84
00:05:31,500 --> 00:05:32,800
How did you find that out?

85
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:35,900
I snuck into his office
and rifled through his things.

86
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:39,600
Of course you did.
But that doesn't prove

87
00:05:39,700 --> 00:05:41,200
he had anything to do
with Monique's murder.

88
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:43,300
No, but it's a piece
of the puzzle.

89
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:45,800
<i>I mean, he did
have an affair with her.</i>

90
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:47,300
And when you combine that

91
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:49,000
with the fact that
his first fe went missing...

92
00:05:53,900 --> 00:05:55,300
So you're Alma.

93
00:05:55,300 --> 00:05:57,300
Where have you been
all this time?

94
00:05:57,600 --> 00:05:59,400
In Canada.
My aunt lives there.

95
00:05:59,400 --> 00:06:01,200
Well, you should've
told someone.

96
00:06:01,200 --> 00:06:03,000
People thought
you were dead.

97
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:05,300
Some even thought
that Orson killed you.

98
00:06:05,300 --> 00:06:08,300
Well, that's sort of what
I wanted them to think.

99
00:06:08,600 --> 00:06:11,400
That's why I left my bird behind
and only took cash,

100
00:06:11,600 --> 00:06:13,700
so they couldn't trace me
through my credit cards.

101
00:06:13,800 --> 00:06:15,900
So you
deliberately framed Orson?

102
00:06:16,700 --> 00:06:19,500
I'm not saying
it was my finest hour.

103
00:06:19,500 --> 00:06:22,800
But you have to understand,
Orson hurt me very badly.

104
00:06:22,800 --> 00:06:24,500
He cheated on me.

105
00:06:24,500 --> 00:06:26,800
Yes, I know--
with Monique polier.

106
00:06:26,800 --> 00:06:29,700
And I thought,
if I disappeared,

107
00:06:29,800 --> 00:06:33,400
she'd get scared and leave him,
like he left me.

108
00:06:33,400 --> 00:06:35,500
Isn't jealousy awful?

109
00:06:35,500 --> 00:06:38,100
So why have you come back?

110
00:06:38,200 --> 00:06:39,500
I found
this fantastic therapist.

111
00:06:39,500 --> 00:06:42,900
He told me
that by holding on to my anger

112
00:06:42,900 --> 00:06:45,500
I was really just hurting
myself, which was hard to deny.

113
00:06:45,700 --> 00:06:46,600
I mean, hello,

114
00:06:46,700 --> 00:06:49,500
I'm here in Winnipeg
with a deaf aunt and no credit.

115
00:06:51,300 --> 00:06:54,400
So I thought,
it's time to make amends.

116
00:06:55,400 --> 00:06:56,300
Darling?

117
00:06:57,200 --> 00:07:01,100
Mrs McLean canceled, so...
I'm free for lunch.

00:09:51,900 --> 00:09:54,200
I--you know what?
I got you something, too.

176
00:09:55,400 --> 00:09:56,300
This...

177
00:09:57,400 --> 00:09:58,300
is Nellie.

178
00:09:59,700 --> 00:10:02,700
My grandma gave her to me
when I was little,

179
00:10:02,700 --> 00:10:06,900
and I was hoping you
could take care of her for me.

180
00:10:08,500 --> 00:10:09,500
Thanks.

181
00:10:12,600 --> 00:10:15,300
Hey, honey, why don't you
take your stuff and go upstairs

182
00:10:15,300 --> 00:10:17,100
and, uh, get ready
for lunch, okay?

183
00:10:17,100 --> 00:10:18,000
And I'll make some chili.

184
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:19,000
Okay, daddy.

185
00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:23,700
Honey...

186
00:10:24,700 --> 00:10:27,600
that was so sweet...
to give her your doll.

187
00:10:28,200 --> 00:10:30,500
Oh. She didn't seem
that knocked out by it.

188
00:10:30,600 --> 00:10:33,700
Well, just give her some time.
She'll--she'll come around.

189
00:10:33,700 --> 00:10:34,900
It's a tough adjustment.

190
00:10:34,900 --> 00:10:35,600
Okay.

191
00:10:47,100 --> 00:10:48,100
I must say, Bree,

192
00:10:48,100 --> 00:10:51,300
I don't know when I've tasted
such moist pound cake.

193
00:10:52,500 --> 00:10:53,800
Sour cream.

194
00:10:55,300 --> 00:10:56,300
Ah.

195
00:11:01,500 --> 00:11:04,000
So whatever happened
to my parrot?

196
00:11:05,100 --> 00:11:06,300
I set it free.

197
00:11:06,400 --> 00:11:07,200
Mmm!

198
00:11:07,900 --> 00:11:10,000
Orson, they don't
fair well in the wild.

199
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:13,100
You should've--
- For God's sake, Alma,
who cares about the damn bird?

200
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:15,300
You set me up.

201
00:11:16,700 --> 00:11:18,400
Why don't I wrap up
a piece of this pound cake

202
00:11:18,400 --> 00:11:19,800
for you to enjoy later?

203
00:11:23,000 --> 00:11:24,900
Do you have any idea
what you put me through?

204
00:11:25,300 --> 00:11:26,800
You almost ruined my life.

205
00:11:26,900 --> 00:11:29,400
You've rebounded nicely.
Bree's lovely.

206
00:11:29,400 --> 00:11:30,700
Don't change the subject.

207
00:11:30,700 --> 00:11:34,800
You put me through a lot, too,
Orson, but I forgave you.

208
00:11:34,800 --> 00:11:36,700
Can't we just
put this behind us?

209
00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:39,900
And that's all
you've come back for--closure?

210
00:11:39,900 --> 00:11:42,300
Of course. What else?

211
00:11:45,800 --> 00:11:47,900
I'm out of lipstick.
Can I borrow yours?

212
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:49,000
Sure.

213
00:11:51,000 --> 00:11:53,900
Cherry berry?
- <i>(chuckles)</i> Austin likes
the way it tastes.

214
00:11:53,900 --> 00:11:56,100
Oh, I <i>so</i> did not need
to know that.

215
00:11:57,200 --> 00:11:58,600
So, um, where you going?

216
00:11:58,600 --> 00:12:00,500
Down to the jailhouse
to talk to Mike.

217
00:12:01,300 --> 00:12:04,100
But didn't you tell Ian
you wouldn't see him anymore?

218
00:12:04,600 --> 00:12:07,700
Yeah. But somebody's gotta
tell him about his new lawyer.

219
00:12:07,800 --> 00:12:09,800
Otherwise, the guy's gonna
show up, and he's gonna go,

220
00:12:09,800 --> 00:12:11,900
"who the hell is he?"
<i>(chuckles)</i> Ian gets that.

221
00:12:14,100 --> 00:12:16,700
Besides... why would it be
a big deal?

222
00:12:16,700 --> 00:12:18,000
Mike and I are over.

223
00:12:19,000 --> 00:12:21,500
I was just wondering,
'cause, you know,

224
00:12:21,500 --> 00:12:23,600
You're putting on lipstick
to go to a prison.

225
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:30,200
Thank you
for clearing things up.

226
00:12:30,300 --> 00:12:34,100
Oh, well, it was
the least I could do.

227
00:12:34,100 --> 00:12:37,500
Orson, I'm truly sorry
for the pain I've caused,

228
00:12:37,500 --> 00:12:39,700
and if there's
anything else I can do...

229
00:12:42,700 --> 00:12:44,100
Actually, there is.

230
00:12:44,200 --> 00:12:46,900
I'd love it if you could join us
for dinner this weekend.

231
00:12:46,900 --> 00:12:48,900
There are some friends
that I'm just...

232
00:12:50,400 --> 00:12:52,300
dying for you to meet.

233
00:12:58,500 --> 00:12:59,800
You got me a lawyer?

234
00:12:59,900 --> 00:13:01,800
Yeah, and he is fantastic.

235
00:13:01,800 --> 00:13:04,700
You cannot believe
the scum he has gotten off.

236
00:13:06,100 --> 00:13:07,500
<i>not that you're scum.</i>

237
00:13:08,100 --> 00:13:10,200
But, you know, if you were,
you'd be sitting pretty.

238
00:13:11,100 --> 00:13:13,400
I'm paying you back--
every penny.

239
00:13:13,400 --> 00:13:16,700
Oh, well, you know,
we'll figure that out later.

240
00:13:16,700 --> 00:13:18,400
I-I can't believe that

241
00:13:18,400 --> 00:13:21,000
I just listened to all that
stuff Edie told me about you,

242
00:13:21,100 --> 00:13:24,200
and it turns out you're
the only one standing by me.

243
00:13:26,100 --> 00:13:28,300
You're a good friend,
Susan.

244
00:13:29,700 --> 00:13:32,600
Um, yeah, about that...

245
00:13:33,900 --> 00:13:34,600
It's Ian.

246
00:13:34,600 --> 00:13:38,300
He's not crazy about me
spending time with my ex.

247
00:13:39,300 --> 00:13:41,600
Even an ex who doesn't
remember dating you?

248
00:13:44,100 --> 00:13:46,900
I remember, and I guess
that's enough for him.

249
00:13:49,200 --> 00:13:50,200
I'm sorry.

250
00:13:53,300 --> 00:13:56,500
Well, I, uh,
can't say that I blame him.

251
00:14:02,400 --> 00:14:03,800
Take care of yourself, Mike.

252
00:14:04,500 --> 00:14:05,800
You too, Susan.

253
00:14:19,400 --> 00:14:20,500
Dinner's ready!

254
00:14:20,800 --> 00:14:22,800
Kayla, I made your favorite:

255
00:14:23,100 --> 00:14:24,100
Tacos!

256
00:14:26,900 --> 00:14:27,800
Here you go.

257
00:14:28,800 --> 00:14:30,000
Where's my daddy?

258
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:33,600
Oh. Sorry, sweetheart, he's working late,
trying to get the restaurant ready.

259
00:14:35,100 --> 00:14:37,600
Oh, lovely, Parker. Go wash your hands.
- Phooey!

260
00:14:39,900 --> 00:14:41,000
Kayla, where are you going?

261
00:14:41,700 --> 00:14:42,800
To watch TV.

262
00:14:43,900 --> 00:14:45,800
Oh, sweetie, we don't watch TV during dinner.

263
00:14:46,400 --> 00:14:47,800
But my show is on!

264
00:14:48,100 --> 00:14:50,100
Well, I'm sorry. 
Those are the rules.

265
00:14:51,300 --> 00:14:52,800
My Mommie let me.

266
00:14:54,000 --> 00:14:54,800
What?

267
00:14:58,200 --> 00:14:59,500
Just this once.

268
00:15:01,000 --> 00:15:01,800
Oh.

269
00:15:07,800 --> 00:15:10,500
OK, OK. I know what you're thinking.

270
00:15:11,100 --> 00:15:12,800
But Kayla is going through a hard time.

271
00:15:12,800 --> 00:15:13,800
Come and sit down.

272
00:15:13,800 --> 00:15:16,900
Letting her watch TV

273
00:15:16,900 --> 00:15:18,800
is like me letting you 
eat ice cream when you're sick.

274
00:15:19,200 --> 00:15:20,900
But she's not sick!

275
00:15:21,000 --> 00:15:22,600
Well, that's true,

276
00:15:22,600 --> 00:15:23,600
but she's sad.

277
00:15:23,600 --> 00:15:25,900
I'm sad.
I can watch TV?

278
00:15:27,500 --> 00:15:28,700
Eat your tacos.

279
00:15:37,500 --> 00:15:40,100
Whoa, whoa!
Sit your butts down!

280
00:15:40,200 --> 00:15:41,200
It's not fair.

281
00:15:41,200 --> 00:15:43,800
I don't care! 
We have rules!

282
00:15:43,800 --> 00:15:45,000
Well, she gets to.

283
00:15:45,000 --> 00:15:45,900
She is special.

284
00:15:45,900 --> 00:15:47,200
Now sit down!

285
00:15:47,300 --> 00:15:48,900
Come on.

286
00:15:51,200 --> 00:15:53,100
Does she get dessert,
too?

287
00:15:53,100 --> 00:15:55,200
Of course they do.

288
00:16:00,900 --> 00:16:02,900
What an amazing
documentary, huh?

289
00:16:02,900 --> 00:16:05,700
You know, I read the director
shot over 400 hours of film.

290
00:16:06,100 --> 00:16:07,900
Really?
I only counted half at.

291
00:16:09,700 --> 00:16:10,800
<i>(laughs)</i> I get it.

292
00:16:10,900 --> 00:16:12,300
You pick the next one.

293
00:16:12,400 --> 00:16:13,900
Okay. <i>(laughs)</i>
Mmm.

294
00:16:16,500 --> 00:16:17,800
Look at you!

295
00:16:17,800 --> 00:16:20,600
Who knew you were
such a romantic?

296
00:16:21,300 --> 00:16:23,900
Actually, I...
I didn't send them.

297
00:16:25,600 --> 00:16:26,700
You didn't?

298
00:16:30,800 --> 00:16:31,900
So, uh,

299
00:16:32,200 --> 00:16:33,800
who's making me look bad?

300
00:16:34,400 --> 00:16:36,900
Uh, there's no signature.
<i>(chuckles)</i>

301
00:16:38,800 --> 00:16:40,300
Sorry.
This is kind of awkward.

302
00:16:40,300 --> 00:16:44,400
No, I-I don't care
who worships you from afar,

303
00:16:46,000 --> 00:16:47,900
as long as I get
to do it up close.

304
00:16:49,200 --> 00:16:50,000
Oh. <i>(laughs)</i>

305
00:16:50,400 --> 00:16:53,500
That's sweet
that you're not... jealous.

306
00:16:55,000 --> 00:16:57,500
Carlos would've hit the roof
if some guy sent me...

307
00:17:03,700 --> 00:17:05,200
Would you excuse me
a minute?

308
00:17:16,000 --> 00:17:17,400
Nice try, Carlos.

309
00:17:17,500 --> 00:17:19,100
Huh?
- Oh, don't act innocent.

310
00:17:19,100 --> 00:17:21,100
You know you sent me
these flowers.

311
00:17:23,400 --> 00:17:24,800
<i>(exhales deeply)</i>
why would I get you flowers?

312
00:17:25,200 --> 00:17:27,400
To sabotage
my new relationship.

313
00:17:29,800 --> 00:17:31,800
Oh, with picnic boy? What do
I care if you go out with him?

314
00:17:31,800 --> 00:17:35,000
Oh, you care. First,
you move across the street.

315
00:17:35,000 --> 00:17:38,200
And then, earlier today,
I catch you spying on me--

316
00:17:38,200 --> 00:17:39,700
I was not spying.
I was mocking you.

317
00:17:40,300 --> 00:17:43,100
You need to move on, Carlos.
I have moved on!

318
00:17:43,200 --> 00:17:45,700
You're the one talking to your
ex during the middle of a date.

319
00:17:46,000 --> 00:17:47,300
Is he that boring?

320
00:17:47,600 --> 00:17:52,000
Bill is not boring.
He is vibrant...

321
00:17:52,000 --> 00:17:52,800
Hmm.

322
00:17:52,800 --> 00:17:54,300
And--and sexy.

323
00:17:55,000 --> 00:17:56,500
And yet here you are.

324
00:18:25,200 --> 00:18:28,000
She threw your doll
in the trash?

325
00:18:28,600 --> 00:18:32,800
No. First, she ripped off
its arms, stuffed it with chili.

326
00:18:32,800 --> 00:18:35,000
<i>then</i> she threw it
in the trash.

327
00:18:35,700 --> 00:18:37,200
So what did you do?

328
00:18:37,600 --> 00:18:39,300
Nothing.

329
00:18:40,100 --> 00:18:43,000
And this is after you let her
watch TV during dinner?

330
00:18:43,000 --> 00:18:45,900
Well, I didn't know
what else to do.

331
00:18:45,900 --> 00:18:47,500
I'm trying to win over
a little girl

332
00:18:47,500 --> 00:18:49,700
who clearly doesn't want
a new mother.

333
00:18:50,500 --> 00:18:53,100
Well, I guess
giving her special treatment

334
00:18:53,100 --> 00:18:54,500
isn't gonna solve anything.

335
00:18:54,600 --> 00:18:58,000
You know what might
solve something?

336
00:18:58,100 --> 00:18:59,100
Hmm?

337
00:18:59,900 --> 00:19:01,500
If you were home
once in a while.

338
00:19:01,500 --> 00:19:03,200
You're the one
she listens to.

339
00:19:03,200 --> 00:19:05,000
I am trying
to open up a restaurant.

340
00:19:05,000 --> 00:19:07,300
Our life savings
is riding on this thing.

341
00:19:07,300 --> 00:19:09,300
I know, I know. I know.

342
00:19:09,300 --> 00:19:10,400
You know what?

343
00:19:10,400 --> 00:19:14,000
I don't want you to be afraid
to take a firm hand with Kayla.

344
00:19:14,300 --> 00:19:16,300
She's part
of our family now, and...

345
00:19:17,800 --> 00:19:18,900
you know what that means.

346
00:19:20,300 --> 00:19:21,300
Yeah.

347
00:19:21,600 --> 00:19:24,500
I should treat her as badly
as I treat my own children.

348
00:19:25,100 --> 00:19:26,100
Exactly.

349
00:19:35,900 --> 00:19:36,500
Uh...

350
00:19:38,600 --> 00:19:39,900
Sorry. Um...

351
00:19:40,900 --> 00:19:44,300
I'm not sure
I'm... ready for that yet.

352
00:19:44,300 --> 00:19:45,400
That's cool.

353
00:19:46,200 --> 00:19:48,100
You can't blame me
for trying, though.

354
00:19:51,400 --> 00:19:54,100
Austin, you know I want to.

355
00:19:54,100 --> 00:19:56,400
It's just...
- Hey, don't sweat it.

356
00:19:56,700 --> 00:19:58,500
All right, if you're not ready,
you're not ready.

357
00:20:04,600 --> 00:20:06,300
So he didn't
pressure you at all?

358
00:20:06,300 --> 00:20:07,700
What a great guy.

359
00:20:08,000 --> 00:20:09,400
I know. I'm so lucky.

360
00:20:09,400 --> 00:20:12,100
Underneath all that
bad boy posturing, he's...

361
00:20:12,800 --> 00:20:13,800
a real gentleman.

362
00:20:13,800 --> 00:20:17,700
Wow, you're not only virgin.
You think like one.

363
00:20:17,800 --> 00:20:19,100
Beat it, eavesdropper.

364
00:20:20,500 --> 00:20:21,800
No, wait. Um...

365
00:20:22,500 --> 00:20:23,800
What did you mean by that?

366
00:20:23,800 --> 00:20:27,400
Well, uh... 
guys need sex.

367
00:20:27,500 --> 00:20:28,900
All right?
It's basic science.

368
00:20:29,000 --> 00:20:30,700
So if he's not
getting it from you,

369
00:20:30,700 --> 00:20:32,700
he'll end up getting it
somewhere else.

370
00:20:32,700 --> 00:20:36,400
You're a moron. Not all guys
pressure girls for sex.

371
00:20:36,400 --> 00:20:38,300
Yeah, gay guys don't.

372
00:20:38,300 --> 00:20:41,400
But Austin's not gay,
not even after three beers.

373
00:20:44,600 --> 00:20:45,800
Don't ask.

374
00:20:46,600 --> 00:20:48,700
So what's your point?

375
00:20:50,100 --> 00:20:52,800
If a guy has to wait too long
to see you naked,

376
00:20:53,100 --> 00:20:55,000
he'll end up
seeing you as a friend.

377
00:20:55,900 --> 00:20:57,800
Again... science.

378
00:20:59,600 --> 00:21:00,800
Don't listen to him.

379
00:21:00,800 --> 00:21:02,400
You hold on
to your virginity.

380
00:21:02,400 --> 00:21:04,900
If Austin won't wait,
then he doesn't deserve you.

381
00:21:05,200 --> 00:21:07,100
I just
don't wanna lose him.

382
00:21:07,200 --> 00:21:09,400
It's better than losing
your self-respect.

383
00:21:09,900 --> 00:21:10,700
Take it from a girl

384
00:21:10,700 --> 00:21:13,600
who's known at school
as "Little Miss Van De Tramp."

385
00:21:14,400 --> 00:21:15,600
I thought you made that up.

386
00:21:16,000 --> 00:21:17,200
Only 'cause
it was nicer than

387
00:21:17,200 --> 00:21:18,600
the other names
they were calling me.

388
00:21:25,200 --> 00:21:27,400
I really appreciate
you donating this stuff.

389
00:21:27,400 --> 00:21:29,100
Anything for a good cause.

390
00:21:29,100 --> 00:21:31,700
Everyone at the shelter's
gonna be so excited.
- Yeah.

391
00:21:31,700 --> 00:21:34,400
I mean, to you and me, these are
just a bunch of old clothes.

392
00:21:34,400 --> 00:21:35,900
But to
a homeless woman...

393
00:21:37,100 --> 00:21:39,800
It's a chance for her
to feel pretty again.

394
00:21:40,600 --> 00:21:41,500
You okay?

395
00:21:42,700 --> 00:21:43,500
What?

396
00:21:43,500 --> 00:21:46,800
I asked if you're okay.
You seem kind of distracted.

397
00:21:47,700 --> 00:21:49,600
I... am fine.

398
00:21:49,600 --> 00:21:52,700
Yes, I just remembered today's
my mother's birthday. <i>(laughs)</i>

399
00:21:53,600 --> 00:21:56,200
Can we stop by the florist
on the way to the shelter?

400
00:21:56,200 --> 00:21:56,800
Yeah.

401
00:22:01,000 --> 00:22:03,400
Detective Ridley,
my name is Susan Mayer,

402
00:22:03,400 --> 00:22:07,100
And I'm calling
to "drop a dime" on someone.

403
00:22:07,100 --> 00:22:08,500
That's the expression,
right?

404
00:22:09,100 --> 00:22:11,900
Yes, ma'am.
You've got the lingo down pat.

405
00:22:11,900 --> 00:22:13,700
Good. Uh...

406
00:22:13,800 --> 00:22:15,700
His name is Orson Hodge,

407
00:22:16,200 --> 00:22:17,500
and he had an affair

408
00:22:17,500 --> 00:22:20,200
with the woman that you
think Mike Delfino killed.

409
00:22:20,200 --> 00:22:21,300
Monique Polier?

410
00:22:21,800 --> 00:22:25,600
Are you sure? Because mr. Hodge
saw her body in the morgue.

411
00:22:25,600 --> 00:22:26,800
He acted like
he didn't know her.

412
00:22:26,800 --> 00:22:30,000
Well, he does, and so he's
pretending he didn't.

413
00:22:30,000 --> 00:22:31,200
That's suspicious, right?

414
00:22:31,200 --> 00:22:32,500
Well, um.

415
00:22:33,100 --> 00:22:36,500
Oh, uh, can you hold on?
Hello?

416
00:22:36,500 --> 00:22:38,500
Susan. Hi. It's Bree.

417
00:22:38,500 --> 00:22:41,100
Bree? Uh... Hi.

418
00:22:41,500 --> 00:22:43,100
Can you hold on a second?

419
00:22:43,700 --> 00:22:46,500
It's Orson's wife.
She can't know I called you.

420
00:22:46,500 --> 00:22:49,000
Then how about
you don't tell her?
- Right.

421
00:22:49,600 --> 00:22:53,400
Sorry. Uh, I'm just new
to this whole snitch thing.

422
00:22:53,400 --> 00:22:54,300
Hold on, okay?

423
00:22:55,800 --> 00:22:56,900
Bree, hi.

424
00:22:57,200 --> 00:22:59,700
Sorry about that.
Damn telemarketer.

425
00:23:00,100 --> 00:23:02,000
So what can I do for you?

426
00:23:02,000 --> 00:23:04,200
I just feel really awful
about our fight,

427
00:23:04,200 --> 00:23:06,700
and I-I think it's time
for an apology.

428
00:23:06,700 --> 00:23:07,600
Oh.

429
00:23:08,600 --> 00:23:11,800
Bree, I am <i>so</i> relieved.

430
00:23:11,900 --> 00:23:14,900
Would you join Orson and me
for dinner tomorrow night?

431
00:23:15,300 --> 00:23:16,600
Oh, uh...

432
00:23:17,900 --> 00:23:18,600
Sure.

433
00:23:19,600 --> 00:23:21,100
Good. 
I'll see you at 8:00.

434
00:23:21,400 --> 00:23:22,200
Bree...

435
00:23:23,000 --> 00:23:25,400
I just want you to know
that no matter what,

436
00:23:26,000 --> 00:23:27,900
your friendship
means the world to me.

437
00:23:28,300 --> 00:23:30,200
Oh, Susan, you know,
I feel exactly--

438
00:23:31,600 --> 00:23:32,700
It's me again.

439
00:23:32,800 --> 00:23:35,900
You should also know that Orson
spent a year in an asylum.

440
00:23:41,500 --> 00:23:43,000
Hi. Can I help you?

441
00:23:43,500 --> 00:23:46,500
Hi. Uh, I received some flowers
from your shop yesterday,

442
00:23:46,500 --> 00:23:48,400
and the card didn't say
who they were from.

443
00:23:48,500 --> 00:23:50,400
Can you check?
The name is Solis.

444
00:23:50,400 --> 00:23:52,900
Sure, sure.
Just give me a sec here.

445
00:23:54,300 --> 00:23:55,300
Solis?

446
00:23:55,300 --> 00:23:56,100
Yeah.

447
00:23:57,800 --> 00:23:59,900
Solis... Solis...

448
00:23:59,900 --> 00:24:01,900
Huh. This is odd.

449
00:24:02,800 --> 00:24:04,500
The buyer asked
to remain anonymous.

450
00:24:05,100 --> 00:24:08,300
Really? Uh, well,
the flowers were so beautiful,

451
00:24:08,300 --> 00:24:09,800
I'd like to know
who to thank.

452
00:24:11,500 --> 00:24:13,600
Sorry. I have to honor
their request.

453
00:24:13,600 --> 00:24:16,400
Why? They're just flowers.
They're not government secrets.

454
00:24:18,000 --> 00:24:20,400
If you don't mind,
I'm busy.

455
00:24:20,700 --> 00:24:22,400
Well, okay, wait, wait, wait,
let me explain.

456
00:24:22,500 --> 00:24:25,500
What's to explain?
A pretty girl gets flowers.

457
00:24:25,800 --> 00:24:28,200
<i>do you know how many girls
never get flowers?</i>

458
00:24:28,200 --> 00:24:29,700
I work in a flower shop.

459
00:24:29,700 --> 00:24:31,900
I've never gotten
any freakin' flowers!

460
00:24:32,000 --> 00:24:33,900
So stop your whining
about who sent them

461
00:24:33,900 --> 00:24:36,200
and just be glad he did.

462
00:24:44,300 --> 00:24:45,400
Uh, you're right,

463
00:24:45,400 --> 00:24:48,800
and I am so sorry for taking up
so much of your time.

464
00:24:50,200 --> 00:24:51,600
Sorry for doing this.

465
00:24:52,500 --> 00:24:54,300
Hey!
What the hell are you doing?

466
00:24:55,100 --> 00:24:56,200
<i>(pounding on glass door)</i>
hey, hey, hey!

467
00:24:56,200 --> 00:24:57,900
I'm gonna
make it up to you, okay?

468
00:24:57,900 --> 00:25:00,000
Once I'm done,
I'll send you flowers.

469
00:25:09,300 --> 00:25:11,700
Hey! You won't
get away with this!

470
00:25:11,800 --> 00:25:15,200
I know where you live!
- Yeah? Well, stop by. We'll hot tub.

471
00:25:17,900 --> 00:25:19,200
Hey, mister, help!

472
00:25:20,200 --> 00:25:21,700
She locked me in here!

473
00:25:23,100 --> 00:25:23,900
Gaby?

474
00:25:25,800 --> 00:25:27,000
This is totally her fault.

475
00:25:27,000 --> 00:25:30,100
I mean, I simply asked her
if Carlos sent me the flowers,

476
00:25:30,100 --> 00:25:32,000
and she refused to show me
the order slip.

477
00:25:32,000 --> 00:25:36,100
Are you still hung up on that?
For God's sake.
- No! Wait!

478
00:25:36,100 --> 00:25:37,100
I just need
a couple more minutes.

479
00:25:37,100 --> 00:25:40,000
I need to know the truth.
- What truth is that, huh?

480
00:25:40,000 --> 00:25:41,900
That you're still obsessed
with your ex-husband?

481
00:25:42,600 --> 00:25:45,200
What?!
No, <i>he</i>'s obsessed with <i>me.</i>

482
00:25:45,900 --> 00:25:47,600
You just
imprisoned a florist

483
00:25:47,600 --> 00:25:49,700
to find out
if he sent you roses.

484
00:25:54,800 --> 00:25:57,300
Okay, I see what you mean.
<i>(chuckles)</i>

485
00:25:58,800 --> 00:26:00,400
Here. I'm done.

486
00:26:01,200 --> 00:26:02,100
Let's go.

487
00:26:02,100 --> 00:26:05,800
Actually...
I think I'm done, too.

488
00:26:16,800 --> 00:26:17,800
I'm sorry.

489
00:26:19,200 --> 00:26:20,200
It's okay.

490
00:26:20,600 --> 00:26:22,200
I'm probably
not ready to date.

491
00:26:33,400 --> 00:26:34,000
Thanks.

492
00:26:34,500 --> 00:26:37,800
and just so you know,
I <i>am</i> ready to date.

493
00:26:41,200 --> 00:26:42,600
All right, let's hit it.

494
00:26:44,400 --> 00:26:46,200
Now come on, Kayla.

495
00:26:46,200 --> 00:26:48,600
I haven't finished
my ice cream.
- Well, I'm sorry,

496
00:26:48,600 --> 00:26:50,900
but we got to go. 
I have a dinner party
I have to get to.

497
00:26:50,900 --> 00:26:53,000
They got to finish
their ice cream.

498
00:26:54,500 --> 00:26:56,600
Well, they, uh, you know,

499
00:26:56,600 --> 00:26:58,100
wolfed it down
like kids are supposed to.

500
00:26:58,100 --> 00:26:59,900
So... hurry it up.

501
00:27:07,500 --> 00:27:09,400
<i>(laughs)</i> Kayla,
I'm not fooling around.

502
00:27:09,800 --> 00:27:10,900
We--we're going.

503
00:27:14,000 --> 00:27:15,400
Mm-hmm. Okay.

504
00:27:16,300 --> 00:27:19,200
Boys, go to the car.
I'll be out in a minute. Go.

505
00:27:26,000 --> 00:27:29,000
Listen, sweetheart, I don't
blame you for being angry.

506
00:27:29,100 --> 00:27:32,800
Your mom's gone,
and you're stuck with me.

507
00:27:34,400 --> 00:27:35,500
But...

508
00:27:41,000 --> 00:27:43,200
the last thing
she said to me was,

509
00:27:43,200 --> 00:27:45,000
"promise
you'll take care of Kayla,"

510
00:27:45,000 --> 00:27:46,700
and I am going to.

511
00:27:48,100 --> 00:27:49,700
But you're gonna
have to help me, okay?

512
00:27:53,500 --> 00:27:55,000
We can leave when I'm done.

513
00:28:04,700 --> 00:28:05,800
Okay, let's go.

514
00:28:06,900 --> 00:28:08,700
<i>(screaming)</i>
Hey, whoa!
Whoa, whoa, whoa! Okay.

515
00:28:08,700 --> 00:28:11,400
What the hell are you doing?!
Stop, stop! Stop screaming!

516
00:28:11,400 --> 00:28:12,700
Stop!
Leave me alone!

517
00:28:12,700 --> 00:28:15,200
You're not my mommy!

518
00:28:34,100 --> 00:28:34,900
Oh.

519
00:28:44,300 --> 00:28:45,400
Guys, how would you like

520
00:28:45,400 --> 00:28:46,900
to eat dinner
in front of the television

521
00:28:46,900 --> 00:28:48,900
for a whole week?

522
00:28:57,200 --> 00:28:59,300
What are you guys
doing here?

523
00:29:03,000 --> 00:29:05,600
Kayla, stop screaming!
You're hurting my ears!

524
00:29:05,700 --> 00:29:07,900
Get in the car!
- <i>(Kayla)</i> Aah!

525
00:29:08,400 --> 00:29:11,000
Come on!
We're going home!
- Aah!

526
00:29:11,100 --> 00:29:12,600
Get your seat belt on!

527
00:29:12,900 --> 00:29:15,300
Kids--
they're always roughhousing.

528
00:29:35,800 --> 00:29:36,900
Why'd you stop?

529
00:29:38,200 --> 00:29:41,800
Well, uh, it's getting late.
I got your blouse unbuttoned.

530
00:29:41,900 --> 00:29:43,800
That's usually when
we call it a night.

531
00:29:45,400 --> 00:29:47,300
Do you wanna
call it a night?

532
00:29:48,500 --> 00:29:50,400
What, do you wanna
grab a pizza or something?

533
00:29:59,200 --> 00:30:01,700
I wanna do what...
You wanna do.

534
00:30:02,900 --> 00:30:04,500
Well...

535
00:30:04,800 --> 00:30:06,000
You know what I wanna do.

536
00:30:08,500 --> 00:30:09,600
Well, okay.

537
00:30:10,900 --> 00:30:12,000
Are you sure?

538
00:30:13,700 --> 00:30:14,900
Yeah, I'm sure.

539
00:30:35,900 --> 00:30:37,100
You can always
spot the new guys

540
00:30:37,100 --> 00:30:39,000
by the way
they pick through their food.

541
00:30:42,500 --> 00:30:44,600
So what did you do when
you thought no one was looking?

542
00:30:46,100 --> 00:30:47,900
Cops say I killed a woman.

543
00:30:48,300 --> 00:30:49,600
But you didn't, right?

544
00:30:51,700 --> 00:30:54,200
Actually, I have no idea.

545
00:30:55,800 --> 00:30:57,800
Got pretty banged up in an accident.

546
00:30:58,500 --> 00:31:00,800
Last two years are blank.

547
00:31:01,500 --> 00:31:04,300
Well, that's a fresh approach.

548
00:31:05,000 --> 00:31:07,000
Not sure the jury's gonna swallow it.

549
00:31:07,300 --> 00:31:08,300
It's the truth.

550
00:31:11,500 --> 00:31:12,700
I believe you.

551
00:31:17,300 --> 00:31:19,700
OK. Mrs McCluskey's downstairs,

552
00:31:19,700 --> 00:31:22,200
and we will be right across the street
if you need us.

553
00:31:22,200 --> 00:31:23,300
OK, daddy.

554
00:31:25,500 --> 00:31:28,300
You know, I heard what happened
with Lynette today.

555
00:31:30,000 --> 00:31:33,100
Hey, she is doing her best.
Why are you being so hard on her?

556
00:31:33,400 --> 00:31:35,800
'Cause it's her fault my mommy died.

557
00:31:36,100 --> 00:31:37,900
No. No, honey, it's not.

558
00:31:37,900 --> 00:31:39,400
Mom only went to that store

559
00:31:39,400 --> 00:31:41,300
Because Lynette was trying to steal me.

560
00:31:41,300 --> 00:31:42,800
No. That is not true.

561
00:31:43,600 --> 00:31:45,400
Look, honey,

562
00:31:45,400 --> 00:31:47,500
it is way more complicated than that.

563
00:31:49,100 --> 00:31:50,900
I know you miss your mommy.

564
00:31:50,900 --> 00:31:53,100
And she loved you very much.

565
00:31:53,800 --> 00:31:55,000
But guess what:

566
00:31:56,400 --> 00:31:58,100
Lynette loves you too.

567
00:32:00,200 --> 00:32:02,100
That's why you gotta
give her a chance.

568
00:32:03,200 --> 00:32:04,500
Can you do that for me?

569
00:32:07,500 --> 00:32:09,200
OK. I'll be good.

570
00:32:10,000 --> 00:32:11,500
That's my girl!

571
00:32:13,100 --> 00:32:15,000
But I'm never gonna love her.

572
00:32:16,300 --> 00:32:17,900
And you can't make me.

573
00:32:32,700 --> 00:32:34,000
Well, you've won.

574
00:32:35,000 --> 00:32:36,000
What did I win?

575
00:32:40,300 --> 00:32:41,800
Bill and I split up.

576
00:32:42,400 --> 00:32:43,800
Can't say I'm surprised.

577
00:32:44,700 --> 00:32:46,000
He wasn't right for you.

578
00:32:46,500 --> 00:32:47,300
I know.

579
00:32:48,700 --> 00:32:51,300
So just admit
you sent the flowers.

580
00:32:52,300 --> 00:32:53,600
I didn't.

581
00:32:54,200 --> 00:32:56,300
Carlos, just tell me.

582
00:32:56,300 --> 00:32:58,400
I won't be mad.
I promise.

583
00:32:59,700 --> 00:33:01,000
gaby, if I was gonna
send you flowers,

584
00:33:01,000 --> 00:33:02,800
I wouldn't send you
pink roses.

585
00:33:04,000 --> 00:33:05,700
I'd send you white orchids,

586
00:33:05,800 --> 00:33:07,600
because I know
they're your favorite.

587
00:33:09,500 --> 00:33:12,500
And if I wanted
to cheer you up--sunflowers.

588
00:33:12,800 --> 00:33:14,100
And for the flu...

589
00:33:16,100 --> 00:33:17,300
blue irises.

590
00:33:30,000 --> 00:33:31,800
I hate
that you know me so well,

591
00:33:32,400 --> 00:33:34,200
and it took so long
for that to happen.

592
00:33:34,200 --> 00:33:36,700
Now I have to start over again
with somebody else.

593
00:33:37,400 --> 00:33:40,100
Yeah.
That's what dating's for.

594
00:33:40,200 --> 00:33:42,000
I know, and it sucks.

595
00:33:43,200 --> 00:33:44,000
<i>(laughs)</i>
I mean, you saw me.

596
00:33:44,000 --> 00:33:46,200
I went on a picnic
and ate pudding out of a can.

597
00:33:46,200 --> 00:33:47,200
It was horrible.

598
00:33:49,700 --> 00:33:51,200
<i>(sighs)</i> well, if it makes you
feel any better,

599
00:33:51,200 --> 00:33:53,600
I got dragged to the ballet
the other night.

600
00:33:55,400 --> 00:33:56,900
so you <i>are</i> dating.

601
00:33:58,800 --> 00:34:01,500
That's why you've been
lifting weights and jogging.

602
00:34:01,800 --> 00:34:04,300
Well, if you wanna
bag the big game,

603
00:34:05,300 --> 00:34:06,700
gotta work on the guns.

604
00:34:12,100 --> 00:34:13,400
I'll give you this--

605
00:34:15,200 --> 00:34:17,500
You're gonna be
a tough act to follow, Carlos.

606
00:34:23,700 --> 00:34:25,000
Back at ya, babe.

607
00:34:41,100 --> 00:34:43,000
I'm so sorry
to keep you waiting,

608
00:34:43,000 --> 00:34:44,200
but I don't want
to introduce you

609
00:34:44,200 --> 00:34:47,000
until all my guests
are here.
- I don't mind.

610
00:34:48,100 --> 00:34:49,600
By the way, um,

611
00:34:50,400 --> 00:34:53,100
when my friends
ask you what happened--

612
00:34:53,100 --> 00:34:54,100
and they will--

613
00:34:54,700 --> 00:34:57,200
I don't think it's necessary
to go into all that

614
00:34:57,300 --> 00:35:00,200
unpleasantness
about Orson and Monique.

615
00:35:00,200 --> 00:35:01,100
All they need to know

616
00:35:01,100 --> 00:35:03,900
is that you're back
and we're on good terms.

617
00:35:04,200 --> 00:35:06,000
And Orson didn't kill me.

618
00:35:07,000 --> 00:35:09,100
And Orson didn't kill you.

619
00:35:11,400 --> 00:35:13,800
Oh, okay, just one minute.
That'll be Susan.

620
00:35:36,900 --> 00:35:39,300
Hi. I brought you
a Bundt cake.

621
00:35:39,300 --> 00:35:40,700
Don't worry.
I didn't make it.

622
00:35:40,700 --> 00:35:43,100
Oh, you didn't have to do that.
- I was really touched.

623
00:35:43,100 --> 00:35:45,200
It was so big of you.

624
00:35:45,200 --> 00:35:48,100
Well, when you're wrong,
you're wrong.

625
00:35:51,600 --> 00:35:52,800
Now that we're all assembled,

626
00:35:52,800 --> 00:35:55,400
I'd like to introduce
the guest of honor.

627
00:35:55,500 --> 00:35:58,800
I hope you'll all be as
delighted to meet her as I was.

628
00:35:59,600 --> 00:36:00,700
You can come in now.

629
00:36:05,700 --> 00:36:08,200
Everyone, this is Alma Hodge.

630
00:36:08,600 --> 00:36:10,000
Orson's first wife.

631
00:36:14,600 --> 00:36:16,600
Oh, about that apology...

632
00:36:17,000 --> 00:36:18,100
Any time you're ready.

633
00:36:21,100 --> 00:36:23,800
So you have been in Canada
this entire time?

634
00:36:24,000 --> 00:36:26,400
Well, my aunt Agnes
has a place in Winnipeg.

635
00:36:26,400 --> 00:36:28,300
I hadn't planned
on staying so long,

636
00:36:28,300 --> 00:36:32,900
but I needed the time to find myself.
- It would've been nice if someone could have found you.

637
00:36:32,900 --> 00:36:35,700
There was a whole lot
of drama around here.
- Yes, I heard.

638
00:36:35,700 --> 00:36:38,500
People actually thought
Orson had done away with me?

639
00:36:40,000 --> 00:36:41,100
Amazing, isn't it,

640
00:36:41,100 --> 00:36:43,100
where some people's minds
will go?

641
00:36:46,600 --> 00:36:49,400
Well, you gotta hand it to her.
Just when you think

642
00:36:49,400 --> 00:36:51,300
Bree's thrown
every conceivable theme party,

643
00:36:51,300 --> 00:36:52,600
she hosts a "Shame on you

644
00:36:52,600 --> 00:36:56,700
for thinking my husband
killed someone" dinner.
- So Alma's alive. Big deal.

645
00:36:56,800 --> 00:36:59,300
We still don't know what went
down between Orson and Monique.
<i>(doorbell rings)</i>

646
00:36:59,300 --> 00:37:02,200
Susan, please. We look stupid
enough for suspecting him.

647
00:37:02,200 --> 00:37:03,300
Just let it go.

648
00:37:07,600 --> 00:37:09,500
It may be a little late
for that.

649
00:37:10,600 --> 00:37:13,000
Detective Ridley.
Can I help you?

650
00:37:13,000 --> 00:37:15,200
Yes. I'd like
to speak to your husband.

651
00:37:16,700 --> 00:37:18,300
Oh, well,
I'm afraid he's not here,

652
00:37:18,300 --> 00:37:21,200
but I will be happy to tell him
that you came by.

653
00:37:21,300 --> 00:37:22,700
<i>(Orson)</i> who is it, darling?

654
00:37:27,000 --> 00:37:28,100
<i>(sighs)</i> excuse us.

655
00:37:31,100 --> 00:37:33,600
Can't this wait?
We're having a dinner party.

656
00:37:35,300 --> 00:37:36,500
<i>(Detective Ridley)</i>
hello, dr. Hodge.

657
00:37:36,800 --> 00:37:38,000
Detective Ridley.

658
00:37:38,100 --> 00:37:40,300
We need you to come with us.
We have some questions

659
00:37:40,300 --> 00:37:45,600
about that Jane Doe
we showed you in the morgue.
- Why do you think I'd know anything about her?

660
00:37:45,600 --> 00:37:48,700
well, you <i>were</i> having an affair
with her when she died.

661
00:37:50,800 --> 00:37:52,300
Oh, where did you
hear that?

662
00:37:57,400 --> 00:37:58,400
Susan?

663
00:38:00,100 --> 00:38:02,300
I didn't know
they were gonna come tonight.

664
00:38:04,500 --> 00:38:07,000
Uh, I'm happy to answer
any questions

665
00:38:07,000 --> 00:38:08,300
that you might have.

666
00:38:08,300 --> 00:38:11,400
My apologies. Please, stay.
Enjoy the dessert.

667
00:38:15,900 --> 00:38:17,400
I don't believe this.

668
00:38:17,400 --> 00:38:19,100
You called the police?

669
00:38:19,100 --> 00:38:21,000
Well, obviously,
you weren't going to.

670
00:38:21,000 --> 00:38:24,000
They needed to know that that
dead woman was Orson's mistress.

671
00:38:24,000 --> 00:38:27,000
I told you that
in confidence.
- Did you seriously think

672
00:38:27,000 --> 00:38:30,300
I could sit on information
that would exonerate Mike?

673
00:38:30,400 --> 00:38:33,300
I mean, if you had seen his face
in jail the other day...

674
00:38:33,400 --> 00:38:35,700
The other day?
You--you saw Mike?

675
00:38:36,000 --> 00:38:39,200
Yeah. I've just to tell him
about the lawyer.

676
00:38:40,000 --> 00:38:41,900
I <i>know</i>
that Mike is innocent.

677
00:38:41,900 --> 00:38:44,200
Right, just like you knew
she was dead.

678
00:38:45,600 --> 00:38:47,300
I thought
we had an agreement.

679
00:38:47,400 --> 00:38:50,000
We do. Can we talk
about this later?

680
00:38:50,000 --> 00:38:50,800
When?

681
00:38:51,400 --> 00:38:53,400
After your next
conjugal visit?

682
00:38:54,300 --> 00:38:55,800
Ian. Wait!

683
00:38:55,900 --> 00:38:58,900
Boy, when it comes to Mike,
there's no one you won't betray.

684
00:38:59,300 --> 00:39:00,400
Excuse me?

685
00:39:01,100 --> 00:39:02,200
Hey, guys...

686
00:39:02,200 --> 00:39:03,600
Please leave my house.

687
00:39:03,600 --> 00:39:05,900
Bree!
- You heard me. Get out!

688
00:39:06,200 --> 00:39:07,900
Okay, Bree,
I know you're angry,

689
00:39:07,900 --> 00:39:09,200
but for the sake
of our friendship--

690
00:39:09,200 --> 00:39:12,900
Oh, make no mistake,
our friendship is over.

691
00:39:19,300 --> 00:39:21,300
Okay. You go...

692
00:39:21,300 --> 00:39:22,300
Okay.

693
00:39:29,300 --> 00:39:30,600
So, Winnipeg...

694
00:39:32,300 --> 00:39:34,000
must get pretty cold
up there.

695
00:39:38,600 --> 00:39:42,000
I'm just getting my coat.
- Ian, please, I just lost
one of my best friends.

696
00:39:42,000 --> 00:39:45,100
I can't lose you, too.
- You said that
you wouldn't see him again.

697
00:39:45,200 --> 00:39:47,600
But you had to know
that I would go one more time

698
00:39:47,600 --> 00:39:50,100
to just explain everything.
- Actually, no, I didn't.

699
00:39:50,100 --> 00:39:52,000
Well, that's just crazy!

700
00:39:52,100 --> 00:39:54,000
Why are you acting like
a crazy person?

701
00:39:54,000 --> 00:39:56,700
Because you've already
left me once for this--this guy!

702
00:39:57,000 --> 00:39:59,300
Things are different now!
I-I love you!

703
00:39:59,300 --> 00:40:01,600
You--you don't have
to worry about that anymore.

704
00:40:02,300 --> 00:40:03,800
If we're gonna
make this relationship work,

705
00:40:03,800 --> 00:40:07,600
then you have to trust me,
and why are you smiling at me?

706
00:40:08,000 --> 00:40:10,600
You just said
that you love me.
- Yeah? So?

707
00:40:11,000 --> 00:40:13,500
Well, you've never
said that before.
- Yes, I have.

708
00:40:13,500 --> 00:40:15,300
No. I-I-I would've
remembered.

709
00:40:15,300 --> 00:40:17,100
Well, I'm saying it now.
I love you.

710
00:40:17,100 --> 00:40:19,700
Do you have
a problem with that?
- No, ma'am.

711
00:40:19,700 --> 00:40:22,100
You--you--you can't kiss me now.
I'm yelling at you.

712
00:40:22,100 --> 00:40:23,100
Well, I'm listening.

713
00:40:23,100 --> 00:40:25,500
Well... <i>(sighs)</i>
don't--don't think that you can

714
00:40:25,500 --> 00:40:27,400
get out of this,
you know, by just...

715
00:40:28,300 --> 00:40:31,900
Oh, God. Oh, yeah, uh,
oh, yeah, right--right there.

716
00:40:31,900 --> 00:40:32,900
Oh, right there. <i>(gasps)</i>

717
00:40:37,200 --> 00:40:39,600
Look, I think
we should stop doing this.

718
00:40:42,000 --> 00:40:42,900
I know it's my idea,

719
00:40:42,900 --> 00:40:45,800
but it just doesn't
feel right anymore.

720
00:40:47,700 --> 00:40:50,000
You slept with Julie.
It's no big deal.

721
00:40:50,800 --> 00:40:52,000
Well, it is to her,

722
00:40:52,100 --> 00:40:53,400
and I don't want
to see her get hurt.

723
00:40:53,400 --> 00:40:54,800
Me, either.

724
00:40:56,300 --> 00:40:57,900
<i>(whispers)</i>
so let's just not tell her.

725
00:41:04,800 --> 00:41:07,500
<i>(Edie)</i> there's no place in
fairview that's more peaceful.

726
00:41:07,800 --> 00:41:09,700
All the floors are hardwood.

727
00:41:09,800 --> 00:41:11,900
Oh, there are
brand-new appliances.

728
00:41:12,000 --> 00:41:13,300
And the gardens are...

729
00:41:13,900 --> 00:41:15,000
well, they're beautiful.

730
00:41:16,400 --> 00:41:18,600
So... what do you think?

731
00:41:21,300 --> 00:41:22,400
I'll take it.

732
00:41:23,000 --> 00:41:25,800
Really?
<i>(chuckles)</i> That's terrific!

733
00:41:25,800 --> 00:41:27,700
I'll draw up the papers
in the morning.

734
00:41:32,600 --> 00:41:34,500
If you
don't mind me asking,

735
00:41:34,800 --> 00:41:37,800
why were you so interested
in this particular street?

736
00:41:38,100 --> 00:41:41,100
I've been moving around a lot
in the last few months,

737
00:41:41,400 --> 00:41:44,100
and I need a place
where I can really settle down.

738
00:41:44,100 --> 00:41:45,300
You know what I mean?

739
00:41:46,400 --> 00:41:48,400
<i>(Alma)</i>
I wanna live in a place

740
00:41:50,100 --> 00:41:53,900
where people still have 
some sense of moral value

741
00:41:53,900 --> 00:41:57,200
and where friendships are good and strong

742
00:41:57,200 --> 00:41:59,900
and last forever.

743
00:42:01,600 --> 00:42:03,100
That's what I'm looking for.

744
00:42:04,400 --> 00:42:07,400
Then I think Wisteria Lane is the place for you.

745
00:42:08,700 --> 00:42:09,400
Good.

746
00:42:10,100 --> 00:42:12,300
More than anything, 
I just want to fit in.

747
00:42:15,100 --> 00:42:17,100
<i>Oh, you will, Alma.</i>

748
00:42:17,100 --> 00:42:19,400
<i>You absolutely will.</i>
