1
00:00:01,850 --> 00:00:03,590
You know who's got to be the bravest person

2
00:00:03,710 --> 00:00:04,680
in the Marvel Universe?

3
00:00:04,980 --> 00:00:07,490
Whoever has to give She-Hulk a bikini wax.

4
00:00:08,750 --> 00:00:09,970
You want to talk brave,

5
00:00:10,120 --> 00:00:13,290
how about Captain America's undocumented Mexican gardener?

6
00:00:14,860 --> 00:00:15,640
He's not braver than

7
00:00:15,770 --> 00:00:17,770
whoever uses the bathroom after the thing?

8
00:00:19,450 --> 00:00:21,410
As usual, you're all wrong.

9
00:00:21,540 --> 00:00:23,290
The bravest person in the Marvel Universe

10
00:00:23,410 --> 00:00:26,730
is the doctor who gives wolverine his prostate exam.

11
00:00:28,080 --> 00:00:28,900
How about the guy who gets

12
00:00:29,040 --> 00:00:31,200
a prostate exam from wolverine?

13
00:00:31,990 --> 00:00:33,210
Now you just being silly.

14
00:00:34,150 --> 00:00:35,200
Wolverine's never displayed

15
00:00:35,390 --> 00:00:36,740
the slightest interest in helping others

16
00:00:36,860 --> 00:00:38,560
prevent prostate cancer.

17
00:00:42,850 --> 00:00:43,590
Hello.

18
00:00:44,500 --> 00:00:46,330
Yes, the elevator's out of order£¬

19
00:00:46,490 --> 00:00:48,210
you'll have to use the stairs.

20
00:00:48,420 --> 00:00:49,560
Of course you can.

21
00:00:49,720 --> 00:00:52,080
Pizza dates back to the 16th century,

22
00:00:52,250 --> 00:00:55,300
while the first elevator was not installed until 1852.

23
00:00:55,440 --> 00:00:57,930
That means that for over 300 years,

24
00:00:58,090 --> 00:00:59,970
people carried pizzas up stairs.

25
00:01:00,560 --> 00:01:02,660
Be part of that proud tradition.

26
00:01:04,410 --> 00:01:07,200
I'll go get Penny while that guy spits on our food.

27
00:01:09,630 --> 00:01:12,640
Do you think they gave wolverine an Adamantium prostate?

28
00:01:13,080 --> 00:01:14,800
That's a stupid question.

29
00:01:14,960 --> 00:01:15,950
We're having a conversation about

30
00:01:16,110 --> 00:01:18,330
probing the heinies of superheroes.

31
00:01:18,750 --> 00:01:20,440
There are no stupid questions.

32
00:01:28,160 --> 00:01:28,800
Yes?

33
00:01:28,920 --> 00:01:31,480
Oh, um, is Penny here?

34
00:01:32,140 --> 00:01:33,640
You're Leonard, right?

35
00:01:33,890 --> 00:01:34,940
Yeah.

36
00:01:36,240 --> 00:01:38,850
Damn, it's good to finally meet you, son.

37
00:01:39,010 --> 00:01:41,860
Okay, I think a bit of context here might help.

38
00:01:42,100 --> 00:01:43,690
Oh, hey, Leonard. I see you met my dad.

39
00:01:43,850 --> 00:01:45,170
Oh, good.

40
00:01:45,320 --> 00:01:46,240
Context.

41
00:01:46,850 --> 00:01:47,680
Come on in, buddy.

42
00:01:47,830 --> 00:01:48,540
Take a load off.

43
00:01:48,700 --> 00:01:49,910
Oh, gee, dad, Leonard can't stay.

44
00:01:50,050 --> 00:01:51,390
He just dropped by to say hello.

45
00:01:51,510 --> 00:01:52,600
Thanks for stopping by, sweetie.

46
00:01:52,740 --> 00:01:53,780
I'll see you later.

47
00:01:57,160 --> 00:01:57,690
Bye.

48
00:02:02,290 --> 00:02:03,440
That was odd.

49
00:02:05,270 --> 00:02:08,320
* Our whole universe was in a hot, dense state *

50
00:02:08,440 --> 00:02:12,300
* Then nearly 14 billion years ago expansion started... Wait! *

51
00:02:12,530 --> 00:02:13,540
* The earth began to cool *

52
00:02:13,720 --> 00:02:16,610
* The autotrophs began to drool, neanderthals developed tools *

53
00:02:16,750 --> 00:02:18,500
* We built the wall, we built the pyramids *

54
00:02:18,640 --> 00:02:21,520
* Math, science, history, unraveling the mystery *

55
00:02:21,660 --> 00:02:23,460
* That all started with a big bang *

56
00:02:23,470 --> 00:02:24,350
* Bang! *

57
00:02:30,820 --> 00:02:32,930
Are you sure you have enough comics?

58
00:02:33,080 --> 00:02:35,540
You're going to be monitoring the telescope for 12 hours,

59
00:02:35,690 --> 00:02:37,340
and by my estimate, you've only selected

60
00:02:37,460 --> 00:02:39,290
seven hours of reading material.

61
00:02:40,470 --> 00:02:41,460
That's even factoring in

62
00:02:41,660 --> 00:02:43,860
your difficulty in parsing American comic book idioms

63
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:45,840
like "Bamf!" and "Snikt!"

64
00:02:47,480 --> 00:02:48,360
Is that racist?

65
00:02:48,490 --> 00:02:49,580
It feels racist.

66
00:02:51,110 --> 00:02:52,310
Don't be oversensitive.

67
00:02:52,470 --> 00:02:54,750
He's calling you illiterate, not your race.

68
00:02:56,420 --> 00:02:57,910
Oh, okay. Good.

69
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:00,070
I don't need more comics.

70
00:03:00,220 --> 00:03:01,430
Howard's gonna stop by, we're gonna play

71
00:03:01,560 --> 00:03:03,780
intergalactic battleship and Indian Monopoly.

72
00:03:04,440 --> 00:03:07,140
I don't care for novelty editions of Monopoly.

73
00:03:07,270 --> 00:03:09,680
I prefer the classics regular and Klingon.

74
00:03:11,960 --> 00:03:13,020
Actually, Indian Monopoly's

75
00:03:13,160 --> 00:03:15,410
just like regular, except the money's in Rupees,

76
00:03:15,540 --> 00:03:17,780
instead of hotels you build call centers,

77
00:03:18,640 --> 00:03:21,520
and when you pick a chance card, you might die of dysentery.

78
00:03:23,840 --> 00:03:24,830
Just FYI,

79
00:03:24,960 --> 00:03:26,150
that was racist.

80
00:03:28,910 --> 00:03:30,720
You'll never guess what just happened.

81
00:03:30,850 --> 00:03:32,220
You went out in the hallway,

82
00:03:32,370 --> 00:03:33,660
Stumbled into an interdimensional portal

83
00:03:33,920 --> 00:03:36,170
which brought you 5,000 years into the future,

84
00:03:36,320 --> 00:03:38,160
where you took advantage of the advanced technology

85
00:03:38,290 --> 00:03:40,450
to build a time machine, and now you're back

86
00:03:40,590 --> 00:03:42,840
to bring us all with you to the year 7010

87
00:03:42,970 --> 00:03:45,040
where we are transported to work at the thinkatorium

88
00:03:45,170 --> 00:03:47,830
by telepathically controlled flying dolphins?

89
00:03:51,240 --> 00:03:51,850
No.

90
00:03:51,990 --> 00:03:52,820
Aw.

91
00:03:54,640 --> 00:03:56,110
Penny kissed me.

92
00:03:56,240 --> 00:03:57,950
Well, who would ever guess that?

93
00:03:59,170 --> 00:04:00,580
What... what kind of a kiss?

94
00:04:00,720 --> 00:04:02,620
A big kiss. On the mouth.

95
00:04:02,740 --> 00:04:04,890
Is it possible that she was going for your cheek

96
00:04:05,030 --> 00:04:07,500
and you moved and she accidentally got lip?

97
00:04:07,800 --> 00:04:10,070
That happens with me and my mom all the time.

98
00:04:11,870 --> 00:04:13,560
She introduced me to her father,

99
00:04:13,690 --> 00:04:16,840
kissed me and then shut the door in my face.

100
00:04:16,970 --> 00:04:18,950
Maybe she was trying to send you a message.

101
00:04:19,040 --> 00:04:19,690
You think?

102
00:04:19,820 --> 00:04:21,050
Yeah. "This man is not my father.

103
00:04:21,210 --> 00:04:23,130
I'm being held hostage.

104
00:04:23,230 --> 00:04:24,200
So I'm going to do

105
00:04:24,290 --> 00:04:25,260
something insane in the hopes

106
00:04:25,350 --> 00:04:26,740
that you'll call 911."

107
00:04:27,590 --> 00:04:29,430
Penny kissing me is not insane.

108
00:04:29,550 --> 00:04:30,920
She used to kiss me all the time.

109
00:04:31,050 --> 00:04:33,800
Einstein defined insanity as "doing the same thing

110
00:04:33,960 --> 00:04:37,170
over and over again and expecting different results."

111
00:04:37,750 --> 00:04:38,670
By that standard,

112
00:04:38,840 --> 00:04:40,810
Penny is cuckoo for cocoa puffs.

113
00:04:42,670 --> 00:04:43,540
I'm just saying,

114
00:04:43,660 --> 00:04:45,620
it felt like it may have meant something.

115
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:47,360
Ah, this takes me back.

116
00:04:47,490 --> 00:04:49,280
Leonard obsessing about Penny.

117
00:04:49,440 --> 00:04:51,450
I mean, don't get me wrong, I love your new stuff,

118
00:04:51,600 --> 00:04:54,120
but once in a while it's nice to hear the hits.

119
00:04:55,020 --> 00:04:55,790
Ooh, ooh!

120
00:04:55,980 --> 00:04:59,610
Do "Our babies will be smart and beautiful."

121
00:05:01,040 --> 00:05:03,120
That one always makes me laugh.

122
00:05:05,600 --> 00:05:07,500
Why do I bother talking to you people?

123
00:05:07,650 --> 00:05:10,010
If it'll make you feel better, we rarely listen.

124
00:05:11,030 --> 00:05:12,410
Hey, can I talk to you out here for a sec?

125
00:05:12,550 --> 00:05:13,470
Yeah, sure.

126
00:05:15,260 --> 00:05:18,250
I'm starting to think we're never going to see that pizza.

127
00:05:19,780 --> 00:05:21,940
So you're probably wondering what that was all about.

128
00:05:22,080 --> 00:05:23,900
What, uh, the kissing and everything?

129
00:05:24,050 --> 00:05:26,200
Nah, women do that to me all the time.

130
00:05:27,900 --> 00:05:29,680
Yeah, okay. The thing is, I kind of

131
00:05:29,800 --> 00:05:31,350
told my father we got back together again.

132
00:05:31,530 --> 00:05:32,730
What? Why?

133
00:05:32,900 --> 00:05:34,080
Well, you're the first guy

134
00:05:34,250 --> 00:05:35,520
he's ever really approved of, you know?

135
00:05:35,670 --> 00:05:37,120
You're a scientist who went to college

136
00:05:37,520 --> 00:05:38,830
and you don't have a neck tattoo

137
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:43,000
or outstanding warrants or... or a baby.

138
00:05:44,530 --> 00:05:47,770
What kind of guys did you used to go out with?

139
00:05:47,990 --> 00:05:49,010
Just guys.

140
00:05:49,320 --> 00:05:51,560
Anyway, when I told him we split up, he was heartbroken,

141
00:05:51,830 --> 00:05:53,470
and he kept bugging me: "How's Leonard?

142
00:05:53,600 --> 00:05:54,920
why can't you get back together with Leonard?

143
00:05:55,080 --> 00:05:57,120
I bet Leonard never tipped a cow over on himself."

144
00:05:59,280 --> 00:06:00,780
So to get him off my back,

145
00:06:00,930 --> 00:06:02,390
I told him we worked things out.

146
00:06:02,720 --> 00:06:03,610
Really?

147
00:06:07,620 --> 00:06:09,680
How... how'd we manage that?

148
00:06:10,660 --> 00:06:11,380
What?

149
00:06:11,540 --> 00:06:13,670
I mean, did you apologize?

150
00:06:13,850 --> 00:06:15,170
Did you have to woo me?

151
00:06:17,410 --> 00:06:18,340
Get over yourself.

152
00:06:18,480 --> 00:06:20,020
I whistled, you came running.

153
00:06:21,930 --> 00:06:23,270
Yeah, no, I don't think so.

154
00:06:23,420 --> 00:06:25,450
Okay, why are you arguing about this?

155
00:06:25,600 --> 00:06:26,170
I'm just saying,

156
00:06:26,340 --> 00:06:27,200
if we fake got back together,

157
00:06:27,330 --> 00:06:28,910
that's totally not how it fake happened.

158
00:06:29,060 --> 00:06:29,620
Oh...

159
00:06:29,850 --> 00:06:30,900
Okay, whatever.

160
00:06:31,010 --> 00:06:32,970
Will you please just play along until my dad leaves?

161
00:06:33,090 --> 00:06:34,270
Hold on, you actually want me

162
00:06:34,430 --> 00:06:36,430
to deceive your father with some sort of

163
00:06:36,560 --> 00:06:38,180
sham playacting and kissing?

164
00:06:33,090 --> 00:06:34,270
Hold on, you actually want me

165
00:06:34,430 --> 00:06:36,430
to deceive your father with some sort of

166
00:06:36,560 --> 00:06:38,180
sham playacting and kissing?

167
00:06:38,290 --> 00:06:39,620
Cause I'm good with that.

168
00:06:41,190 --> 00:06:42,350
Penny, you out here?

169
00:06:49,810 --> 00:06:51,900
Come on, honey, not in front of my dad.

170
00:06:52,030 --> 00:06:54,950
Relax, I've seen you do a lot worse with a lot stupider.

171
00:06:57,140 --> 00:06:57,680
See?

172
00:06:57,830 --> 00:06:58,730
He doesn't mind.

173
00:06:58,860 --> 00:06:59,960
So, Leonard, I'm taking your gal out

174
00:07:00,160 --> 00:07:01,500
for a steak dinner, you want to join us?

175
00:07:01,640 --> 00:07:03,710
Oh, dad, that's nice, but Leonard has to work.

176
00:07:03,860 --> 00:07:04,590
Right, Leonard?

177
00:07:04,730 --> 00:07:06,090
Uh, I do, I have to work.

178
00:07:06,230 --> 00:07:07,750
But I'm gonna blow that off to spend the evening

179
00:07:07,950 --> 00:07:10,290
with my sweetie and her father, 'cause, you know,

180
00:07:10,400 --> 00:07:12,030
just the kind of boyfriend I am.

181
00:07:12,160 --> 00:07:12,920
Oh.

182
00:07:13,450 --> 00:07:15,290
Come here, you.

183
00:07:23,550 --> 00:07:24,410
C-7.

184
00:07:25,540 --> 00:07:26,320
Miss.

185
00:07:26,460 --> 00:07:27,260
How could that be a miss?

186
00:07:27,400 --> 00:07:29,210
C-6 was a hit, c-8 was a hit.

187
00:07:29,350 --> 00:07:31,460
Part of your starship has to be on c-7.

188
00:07:32,450 --> 00:07:34,510
Not if it has a hole in the middle.

189
00:07:35,820 --> 00:07:39,020
What kind of spaceship has a hole in the middle?

190
00:07:39,660 --> 00:07:42,900
A romulan battle bagel?

191
00:07:45,390 --> 00:07:46,430
Knock-knock.

192
00:07:46,630 --> 00:07:47,760
Oh, great, you made it.

193
00:07:47,900 --> 00:07:48,930
Come on in.

194
00:07:49,680 --> 00:07:51,070
I invited her.

195
00:07:51,500 --> 00:07:52,960
So where's the telescope?

196
00:07:53,130 --> 00:07:55,730
It's in hawaii, but Raj controls it from here.

197
00:07:55,900 --> 00:07:58,690
He's hoping to see epsilon eridani dim, which would be

198
00:07:58,860 --> 00:08:00,940
evidence of a planet orbiting it.

199
00:08:01,160 --> 00:08:02,860
So we just sit and stare at the screen,

200
00:08:03,060 --> 00:08:04,660
waiting for something to happen?

201
00:08:05,210 --> 00:08:08,160
I did it with you when we rented "The Notebook". 

202
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:15,010
Yes, Gena Rowlands is a treasure.

203
00:08:16,150 --> 00:08:17,660
You'd better open up that bottle of wine

204
00:08:17,800 --> 00:08:19,700
or I'm gonna end up with swimmer's ear.

205
00:08:21,480 --> 00:08:22,350
Excuse me.

206
00:08:22,580 --> 00:08:24,210
I can't be drinking, I'm about to make

207
00:08:24,360 --> 00:08:25,970
an important scientific discovery here.

208
00:08:26,140 --> 00:08:29,430
What? Galileo did his best work while drinking wine.

209
00:08:29,570 --> 00:08:30,440
How do you know that?

210
00:08:30,580 --> 00:08:31,800
Well, he was Italian.

211
00:08:31,950 --> 00:08:33,820
It's a reasonable assumption.

212
00:08:34,580 --> 00:08:35,810
Dude, can you even open your mouth

213
00:08:35,910 --> 00:08:37,820
without spewing a cultural stereotype?

214
00:08:38,080 --> 00:08:40,750
Oh, I... I'm sorry, Galileo drank diet sprite.

215
00:08:42,100 --> 00:08:44,260
Look, you're my best friend, she's my girlfriend,

216
00:08:44,410 --> 00:08:45,530
you should bond.

217
00:08:45,670 --> 00:08:47,410
You know, like you and my mom did.

218
00:08:47,720 --> 00:08:50,050
Your mom creeps the hell out of me.

219
00:08:50,840 --> 00:08:53,940
Yes, but she's stopped calling you slumdog millionaire.

220
00:08:55,190 --> 00:08:56,630
I do appreciate that.

221
00:08:57,870 --> 00:08:58,810
Here we go.

222
00:08:59,190 --> 00:09:01,490
I'd like to propose a toast.

223
00:09:01,650 --> 00:09:03,860
To science and friendship.

224
00:09:05,660 --> 00:09:06,660
Hold on. Wait.

225
00:09:07,380 --> 00:09:09,110
No, it's okay, go ahead.

226
00:09:09,260 --> 00:09:09,700
What?

227
00:09:09,900 --> 00:09:10,800
Oh, I was working with

228
00:09:10,920 --> 00:09:12,980
Penicillin-resistant gonorrhea in the lab today

229
00:09:13,110 --> 00:09:16,220
and I was just trying to remember if I washed my hands.

230
00:09:23,500 --> 00:09:24,740
Thanks for the steak, Wyatt.

231
00:09:24,950 --> 00:09:26,060
My pleasure.

232
00:09:26,220 --> 00:09:27,920
It's nice to have dinner with a boyfriend of Penny's

233
00:09:28,070 --> 00:09:29,720
that knows how to use a napkin.

234
00:09:30,850 --> 00:09:32,080
So not funny, dad.

235
00:09:32,880 --> 00:09:34,960
Let me tell you about this one genius she was going out with,

236
00:09:35,170 --> 00:09:36,350
This... this fella Donnie.

237
00:09:36,490 --> 00:09:37,640
Oh, will you please let it go?

238
00:09:37,800 --> 00:09:40,060
Donnie was gonna make millions turning farm waste

239
00:09:40,220 --> 00:09:42,450
into biofuel and selling it to the government.

240
00:09:42,580 --> 00:09:43,700
A lot of people are doing that.

241
00:09:43,840 --> 00:09:44,490
Oh, see?

242
00:09:44,670 --> 00:09:47,460
Yeah, but all Donnie did was mix pig poop with a little water

243
00:09:47,620 --> 00:09:49,670
and pump it into his mom's Camry.

244
00:09:51,230 --> 00:09:52,040
Yeah, that's great.

245
00:09:52,180 --> 00:09:53,780
It's a funny story. Moving on.

246
00:09:53,900 --> 00:09:55,920
And Donnie was a rocket scientist compared to that boy

247
00:09:56,010 --> 00:09:58,070
who wanted to get beer pong into the olympics.

248
00:09:58,220 --> 00:09:59,320
What was his name, sweetheart?

249
00:09:59,470 --> 00:10:01,730
Curtis, and I'm pretty sure he was joking.

250
00:10:01,920 --> 00:10:02,620
I don't know.

251
00:10:02,790 --> 00:10:04,600
That petition looked real to me.

252
00:10:05,370 --> 00:10:06,740
Yeah, okay, I think this ends

253
00:10:06,890 --> 00:10:08,820
the ex-boyfriend portion of our evening.

254
00:10:09,010 --> 00:10:11,560
Well, I'm just glad you finally found yourself a keeper.

255
00:10:11,860 --> 00:10:12,930
Thanks, wyatt.

256
00:10:14,200 --> 00:10:15,700
I'm a keeper.

257
00:10:20,350 --> 00:10:21,830
Leonard, you want to come in for a nightcap?

258
00:10:21,960 --> 00:10:23,050
Oh, gee, dad, he'd love to,

259
00:10:23,220 --> 00:10:24,820
but Leonard has to work in the morning.

260
00:10:25,030 --> 00:10:26,730
Maybe I could go in a little late.

261
00:10:26,890 --> 00:10:28,010
No, no, no, you can't.

262
00:10:28,140 --> 00:10:30,060
Your career is far too important.

263
00:10:30,330 --> 00:10:32,200
Behind every great man is a nagging woman

264
00:10:32,380 --> 00:10:34,980
who won't let him have any fun, am I right, Leonard?

265
00:10:35,860 --> 00:10:37,110
Don't I know it.

266
00:10:39,460 --> 00:10:40,350
Well, good night, son.

267
00:10:40,480 --> 00:10:41,410
Good night, Wyatt.

268
00:10:41,630 --> 00:10:42,900
Oh, good night, honey.

269
00:10:43,050 --> 00:10:43,970
Good night.

270
00:10:45,980 --> 00:10:47,350
I love you.

271
00:10:50,900 --> 00:10:52,180
Love you, too.

272
00:11:00,880 --> 00:11:02,080
Oh, friggety-frak.

273
00:11:02,200 --> 00:11:03,690
Not this again.

274
00:11:09,520 --> 00:11:13,730
Three, four, five... pass go, get 2,000 Rupees...

275
00:11:13,900 --> 00:11:15,890
Six, seven.

276
00:11:16,030 --> 00:11:19,300
Whoops. Can't go any further. There's a sacred cow in my way.

277
00:11:20,070 --> 00:11:21,210
Bernadette, please tell your boyfriend

278
00:11:21,340 --> 00:11:22,580
to cool it with the cow jokes.

279
00:11:22,730 --> 00:11:23,380
It won't help.

280
00:11:23,530 --> 00:11:25,930
Once he finds a joke he likes, he sticks with it.

281
00:11:26,080 --> 00:11:26,860
Yeah.

282
00:11:26,990 --> 00:11:28,490
Like his haircut material.

283
00:11:28,650 --> 00:11:30,470
Oh, right. Did you get your hair cut?

284
00:11:30,590 --> 00:11:32,450
"No. I got them all cut."

285
00:11:33,730 --> 00:11:36,380
Which is still so funny.

286
00:11:37,220 --> 00:11:38,620
And when you go to a Chinese restaurant,

287
00:11:38,740 --> 00:11:41,180
he always gets the same fortune in his fortune cookie.

288
00:11:41,330 --> 00:11:42,740
Right. "Help, I'm a prisoner

289
00:11:42,880 --> 00:11:45,230
in a Chinese fortune cookie factory."

290
00:11:46,640 --> 00:11:48,780
Okay, I think that's enough about me.

291
00:11:49,090 --> 00:11:51,380
He's right. Let's make fun of his mother.

292
00:11:52,250 --> 00:11:54,260
"Howard, come rub my feet!

293
00:11:54,380 --> 00:11:56,490
My corns are killing me!"

294
00:11:58,340 --> 00:12:00,530
"Howard, help me out of the tub!

295
00:12:00,670 --> 00:12:02,530
I'm stuck again!"

296
00:12:06,670 --> 00:12:07,490
Coming.

297
00:12:11,070 --> 00:12:12,020
Hey, lovebug.

298
00:12:14,030 --> 00:12:15,050
Shut up.

299
00:12:15,960 --> 00:12:17,530
You know what I've been doing for the last hour?

300
00:12:17,800 --> 00:12:20,350
Mm, dreamily doodling "Mrs. Leonard Hofstadter"

301
00:12:20,490 --> 00:12:21,800
in a notebook?

302
00:12:22,430 --> 00:12:24,090
Listening to my father go on and on

303
00:12:24,240 --> 00:12:25,690
about what a great guy you are.

304
00:12:25,840 --> 00:12:27,290
You got to admit, I am... I'm delightful.

305
00:12:30,090 --> 00:12:31,700
Why are you making this so difficult?

306
00:12:31,840 --> 00:12:32,760
It's not difficult for me.

307
00:12:32,890 --> 00:12:34,330
I'm having fun.

308
00:12:35,390 --> 00:12:36,150
Leonard.

309
00:12:36,320 --> 00:12:37,980
What do you want me to do? You started this.

310
00:12:38,140 --> 00:12:39,800
Do you want to go over and tell him we're broken up?

311
00:12:39,950 --> 00:12:41,130
- No.  - Well, then, what do you want?

312
00:12:41,260 --> 00:12:41,950
I don't know.

313
00:12:42,120 --> 00:12:43,310
Don't you think that's something you should

314
00:12:43,470 --> 00:12:45,450
have figured out before you stomped over here?

315
00:12:46,040 --> 00:12:46,740
Maybe.

316
00:12:48,170 --> 00:12:49,990
Leonard, Penny, excellent.

317
00:12:50,170 --> 00:12:52,810
I'd like to say I'm very happy that you're back together,

318
00:12:52,960 --> 00:12:54,790
and if I can figure out a way to do so

319
00:12:54,890 --> 00:12:56,910
and sound sincere, I will.

320
00:12:57,800 --> 00:12:58,890
In the meantime,

321
00:12:59,020 --> 00:13:00,740
I'd like to go over some proposed changes

322
00:13:00,910 --> 00:13:03,210
to the roommate agreement specifically to address

323
00:13:03,360 --> 00:13:05,360
Penny's annoying personal habits.

324
00:13:05,760 --> 00:13:06,920
Oh, my God.

325
00:13:07,050 --> 00:13:09,730
- What personal habits?  - I have a list.

326
00:13:10,080 --> 00:13:14,080
FYI, overuse of the phrase "oh, my god" is number 12.

327
00:13:14,940 --> 00:13:16,390
Okay, Sheldon, you don't have to do this

328
00:13:16,530 --> 00:13:18,230
- because Leonard and I are not...  - Ba-ba-ba-ba.

329
00:13:18,370 --> 00:13:20,010
Are you sure you want to include him in this?

330
00:13:20,170 --> 00:13:21,590
Include me in what?

331
00:13:21,720 --> 00:13:23,010
Is there a plot afoot?

332
00:13:23,130 --> 00:13:24,720
I'll have no truck with plots.

333
00:13:26,150 --> 00:13:26,870
No, you're right.

334
00:13:27,010 --> 00:13:30,370
No, there's... There's no plots, no trucks, no feet.

335
00:13:30,890 --> 00:13:33,170
So what other annoying habits shall we discuss?

336
00:13:33,360 --> 00:13:35,440
Uh, we don't discuss anything.

337
00:13:35,590 --> 00:13:38,210
Leonard is the signatory to the Roommate Agreement.

338
00:13:38,370 --> 00:13:39,930
As such, he bears responsibility

339
00:13:40,050 --> 00:13:42,790
for all your infractions and must pay all fines.

340
00:13:44,010 --> 00:13:44,960
- Fines?  - Yes.

341
00:13:45,090 --> 00:13:46,540
If Penny's going to be spending nights here again,

342
00:13:46,690 --> 00:13:47,870
you'll need to set up an escrow account.

343
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:49,090
Sign here.

344
00:13:54,070 --> 00:13:55,110
Hello, Hawaii.

345
00:13:55,310 --> 00:13:57,660
This is Dr. Koothrappali in Pasadena.

346
00:13:57,920 --> 00:14:00,280
I'd like you to reposition the telescope, please.

347
00:14:00,800 --> 00:14:03,080
Scarlett Johansson's house!

348
00:14:04,830 --> 00:14:06,870
I'm kidding, Hawaii.

349
00:14:07,020 --> 00:14:08,160
Mahalo.

350
00:14:09,100 --> 00:14:10,070
Whoo!

351
00:14:12,150 --> 00:14:13,200
It might have been a mistake

352
00:14:13,320 --> 00:14:15,520
to open that second bottle of wine.

353
00:14:15,770 --> 00:14:17,460
Well, live and learn.

354
00:14:18,130 --> 00:14:20,330
So, Raj, do you think this planet you're looking for

355
00:14:20,470 --> 00:14:22,630
could have an atmosphere that supports life?

356
00:14:22,820 --> 00:14:23,660
Maybe.

357
00:14:23,910 --> 00:14:25,950
If it did, I'd be famous.

358
00:14:26,090 --> 00:14:27,640
I'd be on the cover of magazines.

359
00:14:27,830 --> 00:14:29,350
And then, instead of living alone

360
00:14:29,470 --> 00:14:31,910
in my tiny apartment, I'd have a big mansion.

361
00:14:32,070 --> 00:14:32,980
That sounds great.

362
00:14:33,110 --> 00:14:33,890
It is.

363
00:14:34,630 --> 00:14:36,550
If you like wandering around a big, empty house

364
00:14:36,670 --> 00:14:38,550
with no one to love you.

365
00:14:41,530 --> 00:14:43,670
- We'd come visit you.  - No, you wouldn't.

366
00:14:43,860 --> 00:14:46,400
You'd be intimidated by my wealth and fame.

367
00:14:47,150 --> 00:14:48,120
My only friends would be

368
00:14:48,260 --> 00:14:50,040
my genetically engineered monkey butler.

369
00:14:50,190 --> 00:14:52,980
And the little people I hired to be my living chess set.

370
00:14:56,110 --> 00:14:58,230
He's taking a turn to the dark side, isn't he?

371
00:14:58,470 --> 00:15:00,000
Hold on. He could come back.

372
00:15:00,150 --> 00:15:01,650
Oh, what's the point of everything?

373
00:15:01,800 --> 00:15:02,990
Nope. He's gone.

374
00:15:03,940 --> 00:15:05,030
You know it's been more than a year

375
00:15:05,170 --> 00:15:07,030
since i've even kissed a girl?

376
00:15:07,210 --> 00:15:09,650
What about that hookup at Comic-Con you told me about?

377
00:15:09,810 --> 00:15:10,900
Oh, grow up. I was lying.

378
00:15:11,020 --> 00:15:13,520
I lie all the time. Nobody wants to kiss me.

379
00:15:14,440 --> 00:15:16,260
Oh, you poor, poor thing.

380
00:15:16,440 --> 00:15:19,110
Raj, you have to know you're a wonderful man.

381
00:15:19,280 --> 00:15:21,840
There are a lot of girls out there who'll want to kiss you.

382
00:15:22,410 --> 00:15:23,340
Where?

383
00:15:23,480 --> 00:15:24,990
You just have to look.

384
00:15:28,510 --> 00:15:30,580
No!

385
00:15:40,790 --> 00:15:42,400
Well, this was fun.

386
00:15:48,560 --> 00:15:50,310
Oh! I think I got a nibble.

387
00:15:50,510 --> 00:15:51,770
Oh, be careful.

388
00:15:52,050 --> 00:15:53,210
Give him some line.

389
00:15:54,850 --> 00:15:56,770
Okay, now reel him in.

390
00:15:57,860 --> 00:15:59,130
Oh, look at that baby.

391
00:15:59,240 --> 00:16:00,540
They're really biting, huh?

392
00:16:00,690 --> 00:16:02,940
Yeah. They do that when you set it on easy.

393
00:16:05,680 --> 00:16:06,840
Oh, that's me.

394
00:16:08,620 --> 00:16:09,500
Hello.

395
00:16:09,670 --> 00:16:10,900
Oh, hi, sweetie.

396
00:16:11,180 --> 00:16:12,940
Yeah, I got up early and didn't want to wake you,

397
00:16:13,050 --> 00:16:16,060
so I went out for coffee and ran into Leonard on the way back.

398
00:16:16,180 --> 00:16:18,060
Guess what... We're fishing.

399
00:16:19,290 --> 00:16:21,030
Yeah. Right here on his couch.

400
00:16:22,220 --> 00:16:25,820
Hey, baby. I love you!

401
00:16:26,620 --> 00:16:27,820
That's Leonard

402
00:16:27,990 --> 00:16:29,340
says he loves you.

403
00:16:30,990 --> 00:16:32,180
What?

404
00:16:33,940 --> 00:16:34,860
I see.

405
00:16:35,890 --> 00:16:38,250
The whole thing's bull squirt, huh?

406
00:16:39,370 --> 00:16:41,390
Well, that's very disappointing.

407
00:16:42,040 --> 00:16:43,040
Bye.

408
00:16:50,590 --> 00:16:51,230
Oh, hey.

409
00:16:51,360 --> 00:16:53,670
There's been something I've been meaning to tell you.

410
00:16:55,550 --> 00:16:57,430
I can't believe you would lie to me like that.

411
00:16:57,560 --> 00:16:59,160
Just for the record, I did not want to be a part of this.

412
00:16:59,270 --> 00:17:00,550
I'll get to you in a minute.

413
00:17:00,910 --> 00:17:02,010
No hurry.

414
00:17:02,530 --> 00:17:04,390
That my own daughter thinks I don't love her enough

415
00:17:04,550 --> 00:17:06,340
To support her no matter what choices she makes...

416
00:17:06,460 --> 00:17:07,770
Well, that hurts me deeply.

417
00:17:07,940 --> 00:17:08,790
- I'm sorry, daddy...  - Let me finish.

418
00:17:08,990 --> 00:17:09,650
Oh.

419
00:17:09,950 --> 00:17:10,980
I thought we were past the days

420
00:17:11,110 --> 00:17:13,310
when you would try to pull the wool over my eyes.

421
00:17:13,430 --> 00:17:16,670
Telling me the baggie in your underwear drawer is potpourri?

422
00:17:18,180 --> 00:17:19,630
And the pee stick in your bathroom

423
00:17:19,750 --> 00:17:22,210
Is to check for diabetes?

424
00:17:25,790 --> 00:17:27,150
You know, I'm sorry.

425
00:17:27,310 --> 00:17:28,970
You're a grown woman, and I respect your right

426
00:17:29,110 --> 00:17:30,680
To make your own decisions, but all I ask

427
00:17:30,790 --> 00:17:33,310
is you respect me enough to be honest about them.

428
00:17:33,460 --> 00:17:36,020
You're right. Look, from now on, I will tell you the truth.

429
00:17:36,190 --> 00:17:38,590
Thank you. Now, why don't you go and put some clothes on

430
00:17:38,710 --> 00:17:40,750
and we'll grab a bite to eat before I head for the airport.

431
00:17:40,880 --> 00:17:43,190
- Now you.  - Daddy, he had nothing to do...

432
00:17:43,350 --> 00:17:44,670
- Keep walking. - Okay.

433
00:17:48,580 --> 00:17:51,310
Please, please, please don't give up on her.

434
00:17:53,710 --> 00:17:54,740
What?

435
00:17:55,430 --> 00:17:57,450
I can't go back to the skateboard idiots,

436
00:17:57,590 --> 00:17:58,940
the white rappers and all those

437
00:17:59,060 --> 00:18:01,900
Sweaty dumb-asses with their backwards hats.

438
00:18:03,590 --> 00:18:06,380
Gee, I don't know if it's in the cards, sir.

439
00:18:06,510 --> 00:18:07,860
Then, stack the deck.

440
00:18:08,540 --> 00:18:09,360
Cheat.

441
00:18:09,470 --> 00:18:11,460
Lie. I don't care.

442
00:18:11,780 --> 00:18:13,190
I want grandkids before I die,

443
00:18:13,300 --> 00:18:15,440
and I want them to grow up in a house without wheels.

444
00:18:22,540 --> 00:18:23,890
I'll give it a shot.

445
00:18:24,010 --> 00:18:24,840
Thank you.

446
00:18:25,490 --> 00:18:27,670
Now I'm going to do something here to help you along.

447
00:18:27,800 --> 00:18:29,260
- Excuse me? - Just don't panic.

448
00:18:29,520 --> 00:18:32,180
Now, get your sorry, lying ass out of my face

449
00:18:32,290 --> 00:18:34,340
and make sure I never see it again!

450
00:18:34,870 --> 00:18:36,850
Oh, the reverse psychology thing.

451
00:18:36,970 --> 00:18:37,940
I see. That's very clever.

452
00:18:38,050 --> 00:18:39,540
Don't yap. Just get out.

453
00:18:41,260 --> 00:18:42,940
I'll friend you on Facebook.

454
00:18:49,300 --> 00:18:51,330
Oh, there you are.

455
00:18:51,480 --> 00:18:53,500
Just so you know, I was up all night,

456
00:18:53,660 --> 00:18:55,210
but I have finally completed

457
00:18:55,360 --> 00:18:58,490
The Penny-specific section of the new roommate agreement.

458
00:18:59,910 --> 00:19:01,310
Yeah, well, not necessary.

459
00:19:01,440 --> 00:19:03,040
We broke up again.

460
00:19:15,370 --> 00:19:17,730
Do you even think about other people, leonard?

461
00:19:20,540 --> 00:19:21,330
Do you?

462
00:19:29,010 --> 00:19:30,970
- Hey.  - Oh, how'd it go last night?

463
00:19:31,640 --> 00:19:33,890
Oh, you know.

464
00:19:34,030 --> 00:19:35,700
Same old, same old.

465
00:19:35,840 --> 00:19:37,310
Looked through a telescope, saw some stars.

466
00:19:37,430 --> 00:19:38,330
Big whoop.

467
00:19:39,380 --> 00:19:40,180
Really?

468
00:19:40,340 --> 00:19:42,070
You waited months for time with that telescope.

469
00:19:42,210 --> 00:19:42,730
What happened?

470
00:19:42,890 --> 00:19:43,740
Why? You writing a book?

471
00:19:45,900 --> 00:19:47,920
I'm going to propose a hypothesis.

472
00:19:48,040 --> 00:19:50,640
Last night, Raj accidentally made contact

473
00:19:50,810 --> 00:19:52,450
With an alien civilization

474
00:19:53,400 --> 00:19:55,430
and has been ordered by the United States government

475
00:19:55,570 --> 00:19:57,190
To keep it a secret.

476
00:19:59,110 --> 00:19:59,880
Nothing happened.

477
00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:01,500
Can we please just change the subject?

478
00:20:01,630 --> 00:20:03,260
That sounds rehearsed.

479
00:20:03,400 --> 00:20:05,140
We are not alone.

480
00:20:06,040 --> 00:20:06,540
Hey.

481
00:20:06,690 --> 00:20:07,960
- Hey.  - Hello.

482
00:20:08,210 --> 00:20:09,300
- Hey.  - Hey.

483
00:20:11,610 --> 00:20:14,250
You get to play with raj's big telescope last night?

484
00:20:16,500 --> 00:20:17,190
Whoa.

485
00:20:17,340 --> 00:20:19,470
Where did that come from?

486
00:20:19,610 --> 00:20:21,830
He never touched my telescope.

487
00:20:22,470 --> 00:20:23,660
Way to go shutting up.

488
00:20:23,810 --> 00:20:24,930
I did shut up. Now you shut up.

489
00:20:25,050 --> 00:20:26,560
- Fine.  - Thank you.

490
00:20:31,660 --> 00:20:33,600
How come you didn't call me this morning?
