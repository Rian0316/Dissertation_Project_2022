1
00:00:00,917 --> 00:00:02,485
Previously on "The Originals."

2
00:00:02,486 --> 00:00:04,646
This town was my home once.

3
00:00:04,647 --> 00:00:05,713
I want it back.

4
00:00:05,715 --> 00:00:09,585
You are free. Go far away
and never come back.

5
00:00:09,586 --> 00:00:11,420
Every werewolf will be a bundle of fur

6
00:00:11,421 --> 00:00:14,289
and sharp teeth tonight whilst your
cursed crescent clan will be...

7
00:00:14,290 --> 00:00:15,824
Human but only for a few hours

8
00:00:15,825 --> 00:00:17,959
and won't be again
until the next full moon.

9
00:00:17,961 --> 00:00:18,960
I'm Jackson.

10
00:00:19,395 --> 00:00:20,494
You're the wolf who's been watching me.

11
00:00:20,895 --> 00:00:23,198
You were supposed to be my wife.

12
00:00:23,199 --> 00:00:24,566
It's herbs ground into paste.

13
00:00:24,732 --> 00:00:27,469
On the next full moon when your
people become human, feed it to them.

14
00:00:27,470 --> 00:00:28,804
The curse will be broken.

15
00:00:28,805 --> 00:00:33,007
Kieran, voice-over: I've been hexed,
and I don't know how long I have.

16
00:00:33,009 --> 00:00:35,610
The ancestors said
they'd do horrible things

17
00:00:35,611 --> 00:00:38,163
to me if I misused my magic again.

18
00:00:38,329 --> 00:00:40,115
Marcellus, you are here by exiled.

19
00:00:40,116 --> 00:00:44,002
If I so much as find a trace of
you, it will not end well for you.

20
00:00:44,168 --> 00:00:45,453
Nicely done, brother.

21
00:00:45,454 --> 00:00:47,255
You're beginning to sound like me.

22
00:00:52,627 --> 00:00:54,529
Klaus, voice-over:
They say the passage of time

23
00:00:54,530 --> 00:00:56,765
will heal all wounds...

24
00:00:58,867 --> 00:01:04,204
But the greater the loss,
the deeper the cut...

25
00:01:08,143 --> 00:01:09,377
[Rustling]

26
00:01:09,378 --> 00:01:12,980
And the more difficult the
process to become whole again.

27
00:01:15,016 --> 00:01:21,015
The pain may fade, but scars serve
as a reminder of our suffering

28
00:01:22,825 --> 00:01:28,824
and make the bearer all the more
resolved never to be wounded again.

29
00:01:32,433 --> 00:01:34,636
So as time moves along,

30
00:01:36,319 --> 00:01:40,575
we get lost in distractions,

31
00:01:40,576 --> 00:01:43,176
act out in frustration...

32
00:01:45,897 --> 00:01:47,774
React with aggression...

33
00:01:50,685 --> 00:01:52,487
Give in to anger.

34
00:01:55,990 --> 00:02:01,989
All the while, we plot and plan
as we wait to grow stronger.

35
00:02:06,701 --> 00:02:11,071
Then before we even realize
that so much time has passed...

36
00:02:16,977 --> 00:02:22,083
We are healed, ready
to begin anew.

37
00:02:22,084 --> 00:02:25,953
Spoken like a man who's
made peace with his demons.

38
00:02:25,954 --> 00:02:29,890
My demons are dead
or chased off.

39
00:02:29,891 --> 00:02:34,061
Yes, apart from the one lingering
monster with whom you share a bed.

40
00:02:34,062 --> 00:02:37,230
I trust you can find your
clothing and the door.

41
00:02:47,792 --> 00:02:52,780
You do recall that... woman
tortured our sister?

42
00:02:52,781 --> 00:02:55,649
She also revealed the truth
about our sister's treachery.

43
00:02:55,650 --> 00:02:58,251
And as a consequence,
Rebekah is gone forever.

44
00:02:58,253 --> 00:03:00,587
A desire which she apparently
harbored for quite some time!

45
00:03:00,588 --> 00:03:02,140
Niklaus, it has been a month.

46
00:03:02,306 --> 00:03:04,791
Now I feel our sister's
loss as deeply as you,

47
00:03:04,792 --> 00:03:06,493
but you must stop distracting yourself

48
00:03:06,494 --> 00:03:07,995
with this ridiculous
behavior and channel it

49
00:03:07,996 --> 00:03:09,356
into some kind of action.

50
00:03:09,522 --> 00:03:11,198
Why must I exactly?

51
00:03:11,199 --> 00:03:12,799
Because over the course
of Marcel's tenure,

52
00:03:12,800 --> 00:03:15,335
the city grew accustomed
to having a King.

53
00:03:15,336 --> 00:03:17,504
You wanted this throne.

54
00:03:17,505 --> 00:03:20,539
Now you must accept the
responsibility that accompanies that.

55
00:03:20,541 --> 00:03:24,511
Apologies, but I'm rather
ensconced in other pursuits.

56
00:03:24,512 --> 00:03:28,315
If you can so easily neglect your home,

57
00:03:28,316 --> 00:03:31,618
I wonder what will become
of your daughter.

58
00:03:31,619 --> 00:03:32,986
Have you forgotten what it was like

59
00:03:32,987 --> 00:03:35,132
to live beneath the threat of violence?

60
00:03:35,298 --> 00:03:39,659
We must work together, Niklaus.

61
00:03:39,660 --> 00:03:41,727
Let's make this city whole again.

62
00:03:44,998 --> 00:03:48,728
Perhaps it is too broken to mend.

63
00:03:59,179 --> 00:04:02,347
If you won't do anything, I will.

64
00:04:06,310 --> 00:04:08,053

65
00:04:08,054 --> 00:04:10,089
Kieran: St. Anne's has
long been neutral ground

66
00:04:10,090 --> 00:04:14,588
in our city, so it's only fitting
that we gather in this chamber

67
00:04:14,754 --> 00:04:16,662
at the behest of Elijah Mikaelson

68
00:04:17,048 --> 00:04:20,133
to bring harmony
to this place we call home.

69
00:04:20,134 --> 00:04:21,734
Thank you all for coming.

70
00:04:21,735 --> 00:04:24,806
Elijah: Yes, thank
you, and welcome.

71
00:04:27,740 --> 00:04:32,244
These are the rules of the city
according to Marcel Gerard...

72
00:04:33,746 --> 00:04:37,819
Which of course no longer
apply because I am in charge.

73
00:04:38,352 --> 00:04:39,752
You said if we came along that

74
00:04:39,753 --> 00:04:41,948
we would get to run things by ourselves.

75
00:04:42,114 --> 00:04:44,534
Never mentioned anything
about making yourself King.

76
00:04:44,700 --> 00:04:46,692
While you were each
selected to represent

77
00:04:46,693 --> 00:04:48,361
your own communities,
and I'll honor that.

78
00:04:48,362 --> 00:04:52,565
However, issues which arise between
factions, they will come to me.

79
00:04:52,566 --> 00:04:55,067
Now we are all
to some extent responsible

80
00:04:55,068 --> 00:04:56,936
for the current chaos in the city.

81
00:04:56,937 --> 00:05:01,176
However, you have one very, very
simple choice ahead of you here.

82
00:05:01,575 --> 00:05:05,410
You can all play nicely
together, or you can leave.

83
00:05:07,613 --> 00:05:11,144
Bay lavi à cette fleur.

84
00:05:11,310 --> 00:05:13,980
Bay lavi à cette fleur.

85
00:05:14,146 --> 00:05:16,589
Bay lavi à cette fleur.

86
00:05:16,590 --> 00:05:18,323
Maintenent.

87
00:05:21,660 --> 00:05:23,395
See, Davina?
It's easy.

88
00:05:23,396 --> 00:05:25,116
All you have to do is try.

89
00:05:25,282 --> 00:05:26,932
I am trying.

90
00:05:26,933 --> 00:05:30,970
Trying and failing ever
since you came back.

91
00:05:30,971 --> 00:05:34,273
When are you gonna stop being
such a bitch to me, Monique?

92
00:05:34,274 --> 00:05:36,962
When you stop being weak.

93
00:05:37,128 --> 00:05:43,093
You're supposed to be a harvest girl,
but maybe you don't belong here.

94
00:05:43,259 --> 00:05:46,585
Maybe you never did.

95
00:05:46,586 --> 00:05:48,921
[Shouting]

96
00:05:48,922 --> 00:05:50,767
[Music playing]

97
00:05:54,860 --> 00:05:56,094
Shouldn't you be out there
playing fight club

98
00:05:56,095 --> 00:05:58,030
with the rest of the frat boys?

99
00:05:58,031 --> 00:05:59,932
Nah. That's just for pecking order.

100
00:05:59,933 --> 00:06:02,033
They already know who's the Alpha.

101
00:06:03,635 --> 00:06:05,036
Ohh!

102
00:06:08,807 --> 00:06:09,942
Next up!

103
00:06:09,943 --> 00:06:12,109
[Cheering]

104
00:06:24,990 --> 00:06:27,392
You got to try Tucker's ribs.

105
00:06:27,393 --> 00:06:29,394
Then what? Then we're
gonna go play horseshoes?

106
00:06:29,395 --> 00:06:31,830
Hey. Don't mock country living, darling.

107
00:06:31,831 --> 00:06:33,852
Sorry. This is just
a lot more family fun

108
00:06:34,333 --> 00:06:35,520
than I'm used to.

109
00:06:35,686 --> 00:06:37,772
Well, maybe I can
help you get used to it.

110
00:06:38,271 --> 00:06:40,358
Then all we got to do is just forget

111
00:06:40,524 --> 00:06:42,694
that she spent half her life with humans

112
00:06:42,860 --> 00:06:44,863
and the other half with vampires.

113
00:06:45,029 --> 00:06:46,577
Ollie, back off.

114
00:06:46,579 --> 00:06:49,414
It's ok. If the runt of the
litter has got something to say,

115
00:06:49,415 --> 00:06:51,216
he should say it.

116
00:06:51,217 --> 00:06:52,984
You know, word from the quarter is

117
00:06:52,985 --> 00:06:55,620
your boy Elijah's holding
some kind of power summit.

118
00:06:55,621 --> 00:06:58,501
Guess who wasn't invited.

119
00:06:58,667 --> 00:07:00,291
Where did you hear this?

120
00:07:00,292 --> 00:07:01,659
It doesn't matter.

121
00:07:01,660 --> 00:07:03,094
The point is is that
we're stuck here living

122
00:07:03,095 --> 00:07:05,563
in the swamp while
your vampire boyfriend's

123
00:07:05,564 --> 00:07:08,665
deciding who gets what in the city,

124
00:07:08,667 --> 00:07:10,268
but I guess that shows
how much respect he's got

125
00:07:10,269 --> 00:07:11,973
for the werewolves, huh?

126
00:07:15,873 --> 00:07:17,675
This is our city, too.

127
00:07:17,676 --> 00:07:19,310
We should be able to go
wherever the hell we want.

128
00:07:19,311 --> 00:07:20,878
We would consider it an act of war.

129
00:07:20,879 --> 00:07:22,613
We're getting nowhere.
You vile creatures

130
00:07:22,614 --> 00:07:23,981
cannot agree...

131
00:07:23,982 --> 00:07:27,697
Elijah: Father, calm yourself, please.

132
00:07:27,863 --> 00:07:29,187
Thank you.

133
00:07:29,188 --> 00:07:31,421
Now returning
to the issue of boundaries,

134
00:07:31,423 --> 00:07:32,857
you will all heed to the following.

135
00:07:32,858 --> 00:07:34,926
Hayley: Are you serious?

136
00:07:34,927 --> 00:07:37,728
You're dividing up the city, and the
werewolves don't even get a say?

137
00:07:37,729 --> 00:07:39,009
What the hell is she doing here?

138
00:07:39,124 --> 00:07:40,230
Diego, sit.

139
00:07:42,600 --> 00:07:43,835
We are not dividing the city.

140
00:07:43,836 --> 00:07:44,936
We're establishing boundaries...

141
00:07:44,937 --> 00:07:46,003
No, Elijah!

142
00:07:46,004 --> 00:07:51,175
There is not gonna be a peace
if the werewolves are excluded.

143
00:07:51,176 --> 00:07:54,057
They want a seat at the table...

144
00:07:54,223 --> 00:07:56,643
And if they don't get one,

145
00:07:56,809 --> 00:07:59,617
I can guarantee that
you will all regret it.

146
00:07:59,618 --> 00:08:02,148
[All talking at once]

147
00:08:10,156 --> 00:08:11,738
Do you have any idea what it took

148
00:08:11,739 --> 00:08:13,014
just to get those people
in one room together?

149
00:08:13,015 --> 00:08:17,029
No, actually, I don't because I
didn't even know what you were doing

150
00:08:17,030 --> 00:08:18,363
out here until someone else told me.

151
00:08:18,364 --> 00:08:20,165
Tell me something, Elijah.

152
00:08:20,166 --> 00:08:22,901
Did you leave the werewolves
out because of me?

153
00:08:22,902 --> 00:08:25,604
I excluded them because they no
longer reside in the french quarter.

154
00:08:25,605 --> 00:08:28,606
My immediate concern is to end
the mounting conflict here.

155
00:08:28,608 --> 00:08:31,443
Now I can assure you once
this treaty is solidified

156
00:08:31,444 --> 00:08:33,211
it will expand to include your people.

157
00:08:33,212 --> 00:08:35,047
And until then, I should tell them what?

158
00:08:35,048 --> 00:08:37,115
Sit, stay, roll over?

159
00:08:37,116 --> 00:08:40,418
I would prefer that you remove
yourself from the process altogether.

160
00:08:46,024 --> 00:08:48,527
Hayley, are you absolutely certain

161
00:08:48,528 --> 00:08:50,561
that you shouldn't
return to the compound?

162
00:08:54,232 --> 00:08:57,502
You think the baby belongs there?

163
00:08:57,503 --> 00:08:59,539
You think that's where she'll be safe?

164
00:08:59,705 --> 00:09:03,241
Is the bayou any better?

165
00:09:03,242 --> 00:09:06,344
The wolves deserve a voice.

166
00:09:06,345 --> 00:09:09,614
Give them one.

167
00:09:09,615 --> 00:09:11,676
You know it's the right thing to do.

168
00:09:20,726 --> 00:09:22,527
Genevieve: You should have
seen your brother's face

169
00:09:22,528 --> 00:09:24,731
when Hayley walked in.

170
00:09:25,097 --> 00:09:30,001
Crescent curse is broken then?

171
00:09:30,002 --> 00:09:32,270
Do you believe this will actually work,

172
00:09:32,271 --> 00:09:36,808
that we can finally have some
semblance of peace in this city?

173
00:09:36,809 --> 00:09:39,943
Cami: I saw the light from the
courtyard and took a chance that...

174
00:09:41,279 --> 00:09:43,082
You weren't with
a half-naked psychowitch.

175
00:09:43,248 --> 00:09:45,416
Seems I gambled and lost.

176
00:09:45,417 --> 00:09:47,752
10 minutes ago, I was fully naked.

177
00:09:47,753 --> 00:09:49,520
Oh. Then you served your purpose.

178
00:09:49,521 --> 00:09:51,521
Don't let me hold you up.

179
00:09:56,294 --> 00:09:59,807
You O'Connells sure do
love to piss off witches.

180
00:10:03,435 --> 00:10:05,503
Really? The woman tried to blackmail me

181
00:10:05,504 --> 00:10:08,973
into stabbing you with the mystical
knife of excruciating pain.

182
00:10:08,974 --> 00:10:12,278
Well, New Orleans breeds nothing
if not strange bedfellows,

183
00:10:12,744 --> 00:10:18,482
but I assume you're not here to
question me on my leisure activities.

184
00:10:18,483 --> 00:10:21,052
He's... deteriorating.

185
00:10:21,053 --> 00:10:23,587
The pills, the meditation,
they're not working.

186
00:10:23,588 --> 00:10:25,333
His lucidity's shrinking by the day.

187
00:10:25,499 --> 00:10:28,159
A witch did this, a witch can undo it.

188
00:10:28,160 --> 00:10:29,560
You seem supertight with Genevieve.

189
00:10:30,045 --> 00:10:32,131
Maybe you could persuade her to help.

190
00:10:32,297 --> 00:10:33,697
It won't do any good.

191
00:10:33,698 --> 00:10:37,554
These hexes, they start with magic,
but as they take root, they alter

192
00:10:37,720 --> 00:10:40,265
the very chemistry of the brain.

193
00:10:40,739 --> 00:10:42,873
I'm sorry, Cami.

194
00:10:42,874 --> 00:10:44,769
The damage is done.

195
00:10:44,935 --> 00:10:49,013
I refuse to accept that, and
you would, too, if you had

196
00:10:49,014 --> 00:10:50,880
any concept of family.

197
00:11:03,026 --> 00:11:04,038
Josh.

198
00:11:08,699 --> 00:11:11,335
Davina, what are you doing out here?

199
00:11:11,336 --> 00:11:12,736
I would have met you
anywhere you wanted.

200
00:11:12,737 --> 00:11:14,438
I mean, not anywhere Klaus or Marcel

201
00:11:14,439 --> 00:11:17,774
would be, which could be pretty
much, you know, anywhere,

202
00:11:17,775 --> 00:11:22,045
but you know what I mean.

203
00:11:22,046 --> 00:11:24,726
Hey. You ok?

204
00:11:27,284 --> 00:11:29,188
It's Monique.

205
00:11:29,354 --> 00:11:31,858
She has no idea what I went
through when I was dead.

206
00:11:32,024 --> 00:11:35,492
The ancestors hated me
for what I did with my magic.

207
00:11:35,493 --> 00:11:38,060
I can't just start practicing again.

208
00:11:41,631 --> 00:11:45,568
I knew I shouldn't have trusted
Marcel when he told me to go back.

209
00:11:47,998 --> 00:11:50,501
I don't know how much
more of it I can take.

210
00:11:52,442 --> 00:11:54,277
Thierry: On the outs
with the witch again?

211
00:11:54,278 --> 00:11:57,080
I got it covered.

212
00:11:57,081 --> 00:12:00,317
What was so important you dragged
me all the way out here?

213
00:12:00,318 --> 00:12:01,950
I have a proposal.

214
00:12:01,952 --> 00:12:03,386
I want you and all
the guys who walked out

215
00:12:03,387 --> 00:12:04,987
on Klaus with you to join me.

216
00:12:05,516 --> 00:12:06,823
Rounding up an army?

217
00:12:06,824 --> 00:12:09,859
Can't take back the city without one.

218
00:12:09,860 --> 00:12:12,662
You have nothing.

219
00:12:12,663 --> 00:12:15,165
You have no weapons, no allies.

220
00:12:15,166 --> 00:12:18,001
You go even close to the quarter,
and Elijah will kill you.

221
00:12:18,002 --> 00:12:19,736
That's if Klaus doesn't get you first.

222
00:12:19,737 --> 00:12:24,541
So, what, maybe I should hide
out in bucktown like you?

223
00:12:24,542 --> 00:12:28,044
I think you're here because you
don't want to leave your home.

224
00:12:28,045 --> 00:12:31,334
I sure as hell don't want to leave mine.

225
00:12:31,500 --> 00:12:35,284
A battle is brewing, T, and while
everyone's busy choosing sides,

226
00:12:35,285 --> 00:12:39,300
I'm gonna find a way to
take back our city, so...

227
00:12:39,690 --> 00:12:42,959
You with me?

228
00:12:42,960 --> 00:12:47,517
You were always great
with words, Marcel,

229
00:12:47,683 --> 00:12:50,687
but it's gonna take more
than a big speech this time.

230
00:13:03,198 --> 00:13:05,081
Is that really necessary?

231
00:13:05,082 --> 00:13:09,539
The sickness, it's... It's overtaking
my inclination to forgive,

232
00:13:09,705 --> 00:13:11,520
replacing it with one
thought that I could

233
00:13:11,521 --> 00:13:13,388
barely contain at the summit...

234
00:13:15,491 --> 00:13:19,095
"Kill every last one of them."

235
00:13:19,096 --> 00:13:20,628
We'll figure it out.

236
00:13:20,630 --> 00:13:25,263
I tried to figure it out with Sean,

237
00:13:25,429 --> 00:13:29,939
but I was focused too much on that

238
00:13:29,940 --> 00:13:33,062
instead of trying to stop him,
and I'm not...

239
00:13:33,228 --> 00:13:35,843
I'm not gonna let
that happen to me.

240
00:13:35,845 --> 00:13:38,246
You're an O'Connell.

241
00:13:38,817 --> 00:13:44,053
They are going to ask you to
take my place at the table.

242
00:13:44,054 --> 00:13:47,990
Don't. Just leave.
Just start over.

243
00:13:47,991 --> 00:13:50,491
I'm not going anywhere as
long as there's still a chance.

244
00:13:50,871 --> 00:13:54,496
How many times do I have to
tell you I can't be fixed?

245
00:13:54,497 --> 00:13:57,398
And how many times do I have to
tell you I will not stop trying?

246
00:13:57,400 --> 00:14:00,702
That is just stubbornness like...
like when you were a little girl.

247
00:14:00,703 --> 00:14:02,103
You always had to be right.

248
00:14:02,633 --> 00:14:04,273
You... you... you never listened.

249
00:14:04,274 --> 00:14:07,542
Just that thick head of yours.

250
00:14:08,055 --> 00:14:09,143
I prayed for you.

251
00:14:11,213 --> 00:14:13,728
And I got no answer.

252
00:14:14,117 --> 00:14:16,439
There is only blackness.

253
00:14:16,953 --> 00:14:20,522
There is only death.

254
00:14:20,523 --> 00:14:24,992
There's mine...

255
00:14:25,447 --> 00:14:26,660
And yours.

256
00:14:27,115 --> 00:14:29,131
Aah! Aah!

257
00:14:29,132 --> 00:14:31,298
No, no, no!

258
00:14:38,974 --> 00:14:41,176
Unh!

[Music playing]

261
00:14:58,460 --> 00:14:59,627
Mr. Mikaelson.

262
00:14:59,628 --> 00:15:01,162
Ms. Correa.

263
00:15:01,163 --> 00:15:03,097
Please call me Francesca.

264
00:15:03,099 --> 00:15:05,233
We can dispense with any
formalities, Ms. Correa.

265
00:15:05,234 --> 00:15:07,949
I know exactly who you are.

266
00:15:08,437 --> 00:15:10,405
You own the palace royale casino,

267
00:15:10,406 --> 00:15:13,708
you're one of the city's
leading philanthropists,

268
00:15:13,709 --> 00:15:15,777
and according to my sources,
you're the matriarch

269
00:15:15,778 --> 00:15:20,048
to a rather sizeable
drug trafficking empire.

270
00:15:20,049 --> 00:15:21,716
So why am I here?

271
00:15:21,717 --> 00:15:23,284
Whatever you may think
of me, my family's been

272
00:15:23,285 --> 00:15:25,452
a part of the human faction for years,

273
00:15:25,841 --> 00:15:28,928
which makes me uniquely qualified
to take father Kieran's place.

274
00:15:29,094 --> 00:15:30,857
You'll deal with me from now on.

275
00:15:31,346 --> 00:15:33,599
Are you giving me a mandate?

276
00:15:33,996 --> 00:15:36,931
No. Heh heh heh.

277
00:15:36,932 --> 00:15:38,896
I'm giving you an ally.

278
00:15:39,062 --> 00:15:41,769
I want peace just as much as you do.

279
00:15:41,770 --> 00:15:46,973
My lifestyle, which I enjoy
very much, depends on it.

280
00:15:46,975 --> 00:15:50,111
Yes, I can see you're highly motivated.

281
00:15:50,112 --> 00:15:52,380
You know, I should mention,

282
00:15:52,381 --> 00:15:54,115
I've already spoken
to the city's new mayor

283
00:15:54,116 --> 00:15:58,386
and the chief of police and other...
Interested parties,

284
00:15:58,387 --> 00:16:00,334
and I have their blessing.

285
00:16:00,500 --> 00:16:03,623
I think you'll find it beneficial
to have me on your side,

286
00:16:04,129 --> 00:16:06,127
even if it's just to prevent my less

287
00:16:06,128 --> 00:16:08,796
civil brethren from lashing out in ways

288
00:16:08,797 --> 00:16:12,565
that could prove painful to you.

289
00:16:14,723 --> 00:16:16,569
Have a good night.

290
00:16:41,580 --> 00:16:43,381
Not a fan of cerulean blue?

291
00:16:43,382 --> 00:16:45,150
Not a fan of your
continued indifference.

292
00:16:45,151 --> 00:16:49,354
Well, it's difficult trying to unite
a community that has a history

293
00:16:49,355 --> 00:16:50,555
of mutual loathing.

294
00:16:50,556 --> 00:16:51,790
Spare me the platitudes, Niklaus.

295
00:16:51,791 --> 00:16:52,924
A perspective then.

296
00:16:52,925 --> 00:16:56,127
If you want peace, you must
begin with the werewolves.

297
00:16:56,128 --> 00:16:59,597
100 years ago, they had a
run at ruling this city.

298
00:16:59,598 --> 00:17:00,965
As of late, all they've had is time

299
00:17:00,966 --> 00:17:02,767
to watch their enemies
tear down that legacy.

300
00:17:02,768 --> 00:17:04,135
All the more reason why their enemies

301
00:17:04,136 --> 00:17:05,942
are reluctant to bring
them to the table.

302
00:17:06,108 --> 00:17:09,737
Take a page from Bienville, brother.

303
00:17:09,903 --> 00:17:14,244
If the table's the
obstacle, remove it.

304
00:17:14,246 --> 00:17:19,017
Do you recall in 1720 the Governor's
desperation to secure our help

305
00:17:19,018 --> 00:17:22,086
to build the cities first levees?

306
00:17:22,087 --> 00:17:25,601
We sat with him and refused his offer,

307
00:17:25,602 --> 00:17:29,159
and so he plied us with wine,

308
00:17:29,631 --> 00:17:32,630
with corseted women, and
with raucous camaraderie

309
00:17:32,631 --> 00:17:36,367
until he had his yes.

310
00:17:36,368 --> 00:17:38,703
Are you suggesting that I throw a party?

311
00:17:38,704 --> 00:17:41,268

I'm impressed, brother.

314

Yes. Now if I can just keep them
from tearing one another to shreds.

315
00:18:18,843 --> 00:18:22,946
Well, then for your sake, here's
to a spectacularly boring evening.

316
00:18:36,493 --> 00:18:38,729
What's up, little man?

317
00:18:38,730 --> 00:18:40,430
He's not even worth it.

318
00:18:48,739 --> 00:18:52,548
Since you're preoccupied, I'll
intuit your flattering compliment.

319
00:18:52,714 --> 00:18:57,047
Thank you. I think I look stunning, too.

320
00:18:57,048 --> 00:18:58,749
I trust you've spent as much time

321
00:18:58,750 --> 00:19:03,720
fortifying alliances as you clearly
have selecting that dress.

322
00:19:03,721 --> 00:19:06,395
So you do notice me.

323
00:19:06,561 --> 00:19:08,392
And, yes, I've already
settled the dispute

00:19:08,393 --> 00:19:10,961

in cemetery tours,

326

and I've given the crescents
a welcome back

00:19:14,432 --> 00:19:18,335
to humanity gift in the form
of $100 chips to my casino.

00:19:18,336 --> 00:19:23,974

some champagne, don't you?

329
00:19:23,975 --> 00:19:26,409
Ahh.

330
00:19:26,410 --> 00:19:28,044
You know, in light of Kieran's

331
00:19:28,045 --> 00:19:31,212
deteriorating condition, the others
have acquiesced to your proposal.

332
00:19:31,616 --> 00:19:34,984
You will represent the human faction
until he's ready to resume.

333
00:19:37,787 --> 00:19:40,930
Then I suggest we make the most
of our limited time together.

Look. If you expect me to beg for
my life, that's not me anymore.

I'm here about Davina.

and she won't listen to me.

as your personal weapon?

00:20:44,034 --> 00:20:48,190
I don't care whose side she ends
up on, just that she's safe

351
00:20:48,191 --> 00:20:50,374
because we both know
right now she isn't.

352
00:20:52,728 --> 00:20:55,563
[Music playing]

353
00:21:09,011 --> 00:21:10,745
Elijah: Diego.

354
00:21:13,716 --> 00:21:16,718
You will be polite and welcoming.

355
00:21:16,720 --> 00:21:20,154
Yeah. See, his people
killed my whole family.

356
00:21:20,320 --> 00:21:23,559
My sister bled out on the
floor right next to me.

357
00:21:23,560 --> 00:21:25,427
The only reason I'm standing here

358
00:21:25,428 --> 00:21:29,465
is because Marcel came along and
turned me before I bled out, too.

359
00:21:29,466 --> 00:21:30,866
So I'm telling you right now

360
00:21:30,867 --> 00:21:33,834
I cannot be polite
and welcoming to that.

361
00:21:34,000 --> 00:21:35,920
Diego, I understand your anger.

362
00:21:36,086 --> 00:21:37,706
However, there are certain overtures

363
00:21:37,707 --> 00:21:41,717
that need to be made if we are
to find a degree of peace.

364
00:21:46,715 --> 00:21:48,750
Welcome to my home.

365
00:21:48,751 --> 00:21:52,221
I wouldn't be here if Hayley
hadn't forced the issue.

366
00:21:52,222 --> 00:21:54,189
Yes. It's rather unlikely
that you'll experience

367
00:21:54,190 --> 00:21:56,592
an outpouring of kind sentiment here.

368
00:21:56,593 --> 00:22:00,495
The vampires in particular
view you as...

369
00:22:00,496 --> 00:22:02,029
Well, barbaric.

370
00:22:02,465 --> 00:22:06,401
Hayley tells me that this peace
treaty is important to you.

371
00:22:06,402 --> 00:22:07,534
Yes, it certainly is.

372
00:22:07,700 --> 00:22:09,771
So much so, in fact,
that if anyone threatened

373
00:22:09,772 --> 00:22:11,807
to dismantle what I'm building here,

374
00:22:11,808 --> 00:22:14,208
I'd destroy everything they hold dear.

375
00:22:16,178 --> 00:22:17,778
Have a wonderful evening.

376
00:22:22,217 --> 00:22:24,018
Looking for your shrink?

377
00:22:26,553 --> 00:22:29,265
Don't tell me you're
jealous of Cami, luv.

378
00:22:29,431 --> 00:22:33,128
Just curious why you'd seek her company.

379
00:22:33,129 --> 00:22:36,814
She seems so... ordinary.

380
00:22:36,980 --> 00:22:39,984
Well, sometimes, ordinary
is a welcome respite.

381
00:22:40,150 --> 00:22:43,237
I thought I was your respite.

382
00:22:43,403 --> 00:22:46,365
Well, you are.
You are.

383
00:22:46,776 --> 00:22:52,347
Promise me not another
thought about Cami.

384
00:22:52,348 --> 00:22:53,372
Heh.

385
00:23:13,391 --> 00:23:17,313
I'm so glad you accepted my invitation.

386
00:23:17,479 --> 00:23:19,507
So is this where
the great Klaus Mikaelson

387
00:23:19,508 --> 00:23:22,210
says something poignant
and snaps my neck?

388
00:23:22,211 --> 00:23:23,902
I'm not here to kill you.

389
00:23:24,068 --> 00:23:27,114
I'm here to offer you a gift.

390
00:23:27,115 --> 00:23:30,518
Out of the kindness
of your vampire heart?

391
00:23:30,519 --> 00:23:33,621
Our hearts are more similar
than you might realize.

392
00:23:33,622 --> 00:23:37,624
You see, long before I evolved,
mine beat as a werewolf.

393
00:23:37,626 --> 00:23:42,563
I know your power.
I know your burden.

394
00:23:42,564 --> 00:23:45,633
I'm here to take the latter away.

395
00:23:45,634 --> 00:23:49,236
You want to make me a hybrid.

396
00:23:49,237 --> 00:23:53,374
I put my pack first, and I'm not
gonna let anything compromise

397
00:23:53,375 --> 00:23:55,709
my family line, especially becoming

398
00:23:55,710 --> 00:23:58,479
some bloodthirsty vampire parasite.

399
00:23:58,645 --> 00:24:02,316
That pride...

400
00:24:02,317 --> 00:24:05,519
That sense of loyalty,

401
00:24:05,520 --> 00:24:08,906
well, that's exactly why I
haven't snapped your neck yet.

402
00:24:09,357 --> 00:24:12,158
Well, if you're not gonna kill me,
then what the hell do you want?

403
00:24:12,160 --> 00:24:16,897
Only to give you back the
city that was taken from you.

404
00:24:16,898 --> 00:24:19,599
How was that for poignant?

405
00:24:26,625 --> 00:24:28,244
Why would I trust someone

406
00:24:28,245 --> 00:24:30,761
who's conspiring behind
his own brother's back?

407
00:24:30,927 --> 00:24:34,352
I'm not trying to
undermine Elijah's venture.

408
00:24:34,353 --> 00:24:36,821
I'm supporting his vision.

409
00:24:36,822 --> 00:24:38,560
Vampires destroy life to survive,

410
00:24:38,726 --> 00:24:41,792
witches are only as powerful
as their dead,

411
00:24:41,793 --> 00:24:43,861
but the werewolves have thrived

412
00:24:43,862 --> 00:24:46,696
because their strength
comes from family unity.

413
00:24:46,698 --> 00:24:50,864
The safety of that unity is what
I want for my unborn child.

414
00:24:53,871 --> 00:24:56,726
The painful truth is

415
00:24:56,727 --> 00:25:02,580
vampires are the antithesis
of unity.

416
00:25:02,581 --> 00:25:06,216
So, what, after a thousand years,
you're finally ready to embrace

417
00:25:06,217 --> 00:25:09,453
the other half of your family tree?

418
00:25:09,454 --> 00:25:13,891
Maybe the other half doesn't want you.

419
00:25:13,892 --> 00:25:18,528
Oh, they will once they
return to the quarter.

420
00:25:20,867 --> 00:25:24,304
You got a plan to back that up?

421
00:25:24,305 --> 00:25:27,140
My mother was a very powerful witch.

422
00:25:27,141 --> 00:25:30,909
I watched her craft all
manner of magical items,

423
00:25:30,911 --> 00:25:34,813
but her most prized
possession was this ring.

424
00:25:34,815 --> 00:25:36,916
I hadn't seen it for 1,000 years,

425
00:25:36,917 --> 00:25:39,788
and then it turned up hanging
around the neck of a werewolf,

426
00:25:39,954 --> 00:25:44,623
a direct descendant
of my biological father.

427
00:25:44,625 --> 00:25:47,379
I believe she gave him this ring

428
00:25:47,861 --> 00:25:49,840
as a way of freeing him.

429
00:25:50,006 --> 00:25:51,097
How so?

430
00:25:51,098 --> 00:25:53,132
Daylight rings shield
vampires from the sun,

431
00:25:53,133 --> 00:25:58,637
so why not a moonlight ring to
protect werewolves from the curse?

432
00:25:59,098 --> 00:26:02,603
Think about it...
No more breaking bones,

433
00:26:02,769 --> 00:26:06,144
no more losing control
to the beast within.

434
00:26:12,485 --> 00:26:15,157
What do I have to do?

435
00:26:15,323 --> 00:26:17,822
[Music playing]

436
00:26:19,692 --> 00:26:21,059
Hey.

437
00:26:23,362 --> 00:26:24,630
You look, um...

438
00:26:24,631 --> 00:26:28,834
Nervous, out of place,
short in this dress?

439
00:26:28,835 --> 00:26:32,437
I was gonna say pretty.

440
00:26:32,882 --> 00:26:34,049
I'm Oliver.

441
00:26:35,885 --> 00:26:39,473
So what's the name of the girl
I'm about to ask to dance?

442
00:26:39,639 --> 00:26:41,308
Her name is Monique.

443
00:26:45,144 --> 00:26:46,351
[Sighs]

444
00:26:54,159 --> 00:26:55,993
Would you care to dance?

445
00:27:06,405 --> 00:27:08,807
You outdid yourself.

446
00:27:08,808 --> 00:27:12,511
You even got Klaus to come out and play.

447
00:27:12,512 --> 00:27:14,813
Yes. It seems that only
a sizeable soiree

448
00:27:14,814 --> 00:27:18,617
is enough to tear my brother away
from his efforts at the easel.

449
00:27:18,618 --> 00:27:21,486
That's never a good sign.

450
00:27:21,487 --> 00:27:25,490
Klaus once told me that his painting
was a metaphor for control,

451
00:27:25,491 --> 00:27:28,960
for achieving his vision
through sheer force of will.

452
00:27:28,961 --> 00:27:30,395
Well, trustfully, I'd be shocked if he

453
00:27:30,396 --> 00:27:33,665
didn't have at least a dozen or so
of those visions swarming around

454
00:27:33,666 --> 00:27:36,301
in that insidious skull of his.

455
00:27:36,302 --> 00:27:40,138
I do hope your daughter
inherits her mother's...

456
00:27:40,139 --> 00:27:41,605
Everything.

457
00:27:46,745 --> 00:27:48,750
It is weird being back here.

458
00:27:48,916 --> 00:27:50,419
Not unpleasant I hope.

459
00:27:50,816 --> 00:27:52,650
Not entirely.

460
00:27:54,753 --> 00:27:58,222
Are you entirely sure you
shouldn't be here with us?

461
00:28:01,059 --> 00:28:03,928
Why, Elijah?

462
00:28:03,929 --> 00:28:08,500
Because you don't think it's
safe in big, bad wolf country?

463
00:28:08,501 --> 00:28:10,101
I'm not gonna sit in a rocking chair

464
00:28:10,102 --> 00:28:12,604
and knit booties, or haven't
you figured that out yet?

465
00:28:12,605 --> 00:28:13,938
Can I have a minute, Hayley?

466
00:28:13,939 --> 00:28:15,193
You can have it later.

467
00:28:15,359 --> 00:28:17,154
Actually, he can have this dance.

468
00:28:24,182 --> 00:28:25,782
Everything all right?

469
00:28:26,162 --> 00:28:28,219
Yeah. Fine.

470
00:28:28,220 --> 00:28:32,357
We were just discussing
the future of the city.

471
00:28:32,358 --> 00:28:35,213
How can you be thinking
about the city right now?

472
00:28:36,761 --> 00:28:39,629
I should have told you how
beautiful you look tonight.

473
00:29:00,351 --> 00:29:03,654
Easy. Easy.

474
00:29:03,655 --> 00:29:07,490
Julep minus the sugar and mint?

475
00:29:13,626 --> 00:29:14,625
Hey.

476
00:29:17,668 --> 00:29:19,904
I just saw Kieran.

477
00:29:19,905 --> 00:29:21,635
He's not gonna hurt you again.

478
00:29:22,007 --> 00:29:24,140
In fact, he won't
leave the attic at all.

479
00:29:24,142 --> 00:29:26,556
I arranged for a little boundary spell.

480
00:29:26,722 --> 00:29:28,212
You got a witch to help you?

481
00:29:28,213 --> 00:29:29,646
I thought they hated you.

482
00:29:30,184 --> 00:29:31,681
For you, I found one who doesn't.

483
00:29:33,951 --> 00:29:35,319
Hey. What's wrong?

484
00:29:35,320 --> 00:29:36,586
Nothing.

485
00:29:39,023 --> 00:29:41,724
You're the first person
to help me in a month.

486
00:29:45,629 --> 00:29:47,364
Kieran's the only family I have left.

487
00:29:47,365 --> 00:29:50,914
Without him, I'm alone.

488
00:29:51,336 --> 00:29:53,404
Yeah.

489
00:29:53,405 --> 00:29:56,739
Yeah. I'm a little short
on family myself these days.

490
00:29:59,797 --> 00:30:04,993
Hey. If there's anything I can do,
Cami, just... just let me know.

491
00:30:06,017 --> 00:30:08,184
There is one thing.

492
00:30:10,254 --> 00:30:11,921
We're out of bourbon.

493
00:30:14,395 --> 00:30:15,459
[Music playing]

494
00:30:15,460 --> 00:30:17,494
Hey, wolf boy.

495
00:30:17,495 --> 00:30:20,068
Should have had them
put it in a bowl for you.

496
00:30:20,498 --> 00:30:22,432
Well, yeah, if you want
me to crush your skull with it.

497
00:30:22,433 --> 00:30:25,407
Please, boys. At least fight
over something interesting...

498
00:30:25,573 --> 00:30:27,492
Me perhaps?

499
00:30:27,658 --> 00:30:29,940
Naw. You don't want to get
involved with his kind.

500
00:30:29,941 --> 00:30:33,376
See, they got this nasty little
habit of going berserk and ripping

501
00:30:33,377 --> 00:30:35,010
innocent people to shreds.

502
00:30:35,012 --> 00:30:36,880
No, no, no.
Ok. Look.

503
00:30:36,881 --> 00:30:42,880
If my people wronged you in any
way, you have my condolences, ok?

504
00:30:43,921 --> 00:30:45,956
Though I'd be surprised my kin
could choke them down,

505
00:30:45,957 --> 00:30:47,489
being half as ugly as him.

506
00:30:56,354 --> 00:30:59,107
This ends now.

507
00:30:59,273 --> 00:31:00,670
I won't ask again.

508
00:31:00,671 --> 00:31:02,438
Jackson: Oh, we'll end it all right.

509
00:31:05,375 --> 00:31:06,865
Hayley: What's stopping you?

510
00:31:09,112 --> 00:31:10,452
Kill him.

511
00:31:20,919 --> 00:31:22,688
Go ahead, Elijah.
Do it.

512
00:31:22,689 --> 00:31:25,891
I mean, it's not like
he doesn't deserve to die.

513
00:31:25,892 --> 00:31:27,526
Shouldn't you intervene or something?

514
00:31:27,527 --> 00:31:30,695
Why would I? This party
just got interesting.

515
00:31:30,696 --> 00:31:32,831
I mean, it was Oliver
who handed Rebekah over

516
00:31:32,832 --> 00:31:35,060
to the witches so
they could torture her,

517
00:31:35,535 --> 00:31:38,002
but then again, wasn't it Diego who led

518
00:31:38,004 --> 00:31:40,705
a werewolf massacre last month?

519
00:31:40,706 --> 00:31:43,541
And the witches cursed the wolves,
while the humans stood back

520
00:31:43,542 --> 00:31:44,909
and let it all happen,

521
00:31:45,486 --> 00:31:48,946
so when you think about it,
everyone here deserves to die.

522

Are approaching a point?

523
00:31:51,083 --> 00:31:53,578
My point, Elijah, is this.

524
00:31:53,953 --> 00:31:55,620
If we can't all learn to get along,

525
00:31:55,621 --> 00:31:58,957
if our families can't create some sort

526
00:31:58,958 --> 00:32:01,959
of community, then what's the point?

527
00:32:01,961 --> 00:32:05,095
Kill each other
and get it all over with.

528
00:32:18,576 --> 00:32:21,746
Josh: You know, I've only
gotten roses once in my life.

529
00:32:21,747 --> 00:32:23,815
Didn't even get to keep them.

530
00:32:23,816 --> 00:32:25,216
Why not?

531
00:32:25,217 --> 00:32:28,052
My first boyfriend,
my only boyfriend really,

532
00:32:28,053 --> 00:32:30,655
gave them to me
for Valentine's Day senior year.

533
00:32:30,656 --> 00:32:34,392
Tried to hide them in my bedroom,
but my parents found them.

534
00:32:34,393 --> 00:32:38,629
You may not know it, but roses will
jam even the best paper shredders.

535
00:32:38,630 --> 00:32:44,435
You know, I don't have
a home to go home to

536
00:32:44,436 --> 00:32:47,299
or a family to go home to.

537
00:32:47,739 --> 00:32:53,738
I used to hate myself for
that, but the thing is,

538
00:32:54,046 --> 00:32:57,047
I don't really care
what they think anymore.

539
00:32:59,351 --> 00:33:04,922
If your family doesn't like you
the way you are, screw them.

540
00:33:04,923 --> 00:33:10,922
You got me and Cami,
even Marcel if you want.

541
00:33:12,564 --> 00:33:15,493
Marcel used me.

542
00:33:15,659 --> 00:33:20,137
He used you to fight the people
who were trying to kill you,

543
00:33:20,138 --> 00:33:24,461
and, you know, he also saved
you from those people, so...

544
00:33:26,211 --> 00:33:28,006
You don't have to trust the guy,

545
00:33:28,513 --> 00:33:30,050
but he does love you.

546
00:33:33,317 --> 00:33:37,682
And P.S., so do I.

547
00:33:41,191 --> 00:33:44,527
Even if I don't have any magic?

548
00:33:44,980 --> 00:33:47,931
All the power I had
was from the other harvest girls.

549
00:33:47,932 --> 00:33:51,613
I don't even know
what I have without it.

550
00:33:51,779 --> 00:33:54,103
Don't you owe it
to yourself to find out?

551
00:34:00,496 --> 00:34:03,346
You're a witch, Davina.

552
00:34:03,791 --> 00:34:07,017
You can't change your DNA
any more than I can,

553
00:34:07,018 --> 00:34:09,051
so you might as well embrace it.

554
00:34:13,256 --> 00:34:15,959
Bay lavi à cette fleur.

555
00:34:15,960 --> 00:34:18,014
Bay lavi à cette fleur.

556
00:34:18,180 --> 00:34:20,497
Bay lavi à cette fleur.

557
00:34:20,498 --> 00:34:22,933
Bay lavi à cette fleur.

558
00:34:22,934 --> 00:34:25,435
Bay lavi à cette fleur.

559
00:34:25,436 --> 00:34:27,369
Maintenent.

560
00:34:38,448 --> 00:34:39,447
Ohh.

561
00:34:43,414 --> 00:34:44,921
Ha ha ha!

562
00:34:44,922 --> 00:34:46,790
Ha ha ha!

563
00:34:46,791 --> 00:34:49,392
Ha ha! Ow! Oh!

564
00:34:49,393 --> 00:34:50,927
Oh, oh, oh. Ha ha!

565
00:34:50,928 --> 00:34:52,595
You ok?

566
00:34:52,596 --> 00:34:55,632
Yeah. Just some bruises.
I'm still bruised.

567
00:34:55,633 --> 00:34:58,001
Oh! "Bruise" is such a funny word.

568
00:34:58,002 --> 00:34:59,903
It sounds like "booze."

569
00:34:59,904 --> 00:35:01,571
Do we have any more booze?

570
00:35:01,572 --> 00:35:02,972
Uh, no. I think we drank it all.

571
00:35:02,973 --> 00:35:04,473
Oh.

572
00:35:07,477 --> 00:35:09,678
You're a good friend, Marcel.

573
00:35:11,981 --> 00:35:15,985
You should lie down.

574
00:35:15,986 --> 00:35:18,587
I'm tired of being alone.

575
00:35:21,591 --> 00:35:23,371
I am, too.

576
00:36:02,743 --> 00:36:07,013
Not that that wasn't totally worth
it, but it can never happen again.

577
00:36:07,539 --> 00:36:09,749
What if one of us craves another julep?

578
00:36:15,489 --> 00:36:17,325
For whatever reason, Klaus trusts me,

579
00:36:17,326 --> 00:36:19,093
and you're the person
he probably hates most right now.

580
00:36:19,094 --> 00:36:20,928
He'd see it as a betrayal.

581
00:36:20,929 --> 00:36:23,431
That wouldn't be good for either of us.

582
00:36:30,237 --> 00:36:35,808
Marcel... It really
was totally worth it.

583
00:36:38,579 --> 00:36:40,481
Yeah, it was.

584
00:36:40,482 --> 00:36:42,649
[Music playing]

585
00:37:00,901 --> 00:37:02,936
You said I had nothing.

586
00:37:02,937 --> 00:37:04,738
You were wrong.

587
00:37:04,739 --> 00:37:06,607
I have the same thing
I had when I rebuilt

588
00:37:06,608 --> 00:37:09,144
this city from the ashes
the first time...

589
00:37:09,611 --> 00:37:13,113
Everything to gain and nothing to lose.

590
00:37:13,114 --> 00:37:16,583
I'm making inroads, allies, not
the least of which is Davina,

591
00:37:16,584 --> 00:37:20,530
and I'm not leaving this roof
until I can count you in, too.

592
00:37:20,696 --> 00:37:22,907
Besides, let's be honest, T,

593
00:37:23,491 --> 00:37:24,924
I'm all you got.

594
00:37:26,860 --> 00:37:30,129
I know those vampires, they
didn't just leave the compound.

595
00:37:30,131 --> 00:37:32,198
They left New Orleans.

596
00:37:37,537 --> 00:37:40,550
So us against the world?

597
00:37:40,716 --> 00:37:45,477
We'll get a third and a fourth,

598
00:37:45,971 --> 00:37:48,280
and pretty soon, we're
gonna have that army.

599
00:38:19,612 --> 00:38:22,681
Klaus, voice-over: All change
begins with a plan...

600
00:38:33,227 --> 00:38:37,262
The success of which
depends upon several things...

601
00:38:46,739 --> 00:38:49,202
Depth of commitment...

602
00:38:54,947 --> 00:38:57,749
Passion for one's cause...

603
00:39:05,426 --> 00:39:07,526
Hey! To Hayley!

604
00:39:07,527 --> 00:39:09,222
To Hayley!

605
00:39:11,864 --> 00:39:15,367
Willingness to embrace a new path...

606
00:39:29,682 --> 00:39:33,284
Determination to overcome
any obstacle...

607
00:39:36,889 --> 00:39:42,636
And in some cases,
even making unnatural alliances.

608
00:39:43,375 --> 00:39:46,598
You made a deal with Klaus Mikaelson?

609
00:39:46,599 --> 00:39:49,301
I'd rather turn every full moon.

610
00:39:49,302 --> 00:39:52,037
If Klaus is right,
this magic could do more

611
00:39:52,038 --> 00:39:54,839
than just stop us from turning.

612
00:39:58,944 --> 00:40:01,880
We could finally control what we are.

613
00:40:01,881 --> 00:40:05,517
We could draw on all the strength,
all the speed, the raw power

614
00:40:05,518 --> 00:40:07,785
of our werewolf form.

615
00:40:11,116 --> 00:40:15,288
Our bite would be
lethal to vampires 24/7.

616
00:40:22,085 --> 00:40:24,936
The humans who hunt us,
the witches who curse us,

617
00:40:24,937 --> 00:40:29,507
the vampires who hate us, we
wouldn't just be their equals.

618
00:40:44,274 --> 00:40:46,790
We'd be their superiors.

619
00:41:03,074 --> 00:41:04,075
Sign it.

620
00:41:04,076 --> 00:41:05,510
Why?

621
00:41:05,511 --> 00:41:08,446
You've already done so on our behalf.

622
00:41:08,447 --> 00:41:10,381
Brother, I'm not a fool.

623
00:41:10,382 --> 00:41:11,850
It's clear to me you're
not as disinterested

624
00:41:11,851 --> 00:41:13,251
as you'd like me to believe.

625
00:41:13,252 --> 00:41:14,585
Sign, please.

626
00:41:17,388 --> 00:41:19,157
If there is no peace between us,

627
00:41:19,158 --> 00:41:22,855
then how can you expect
others to follow suit?

628
00:41:23,262 --> 00:41:25,229
Fine.

629
00:41:25,230 --> 00:41:26,984
If it will make you happy...

630
00:41:28,866 --> 00:41:31,197
But I assure you this city's inhabitants

631
00:41:31,363 --> 00:41:34,404
will not adhere to this agreement.

632
00:41:37,375 --> 00:41:40,243
Well, you are welcome
to wager against me.

633
00:41:42,513 --> 00:41:44,347
You will lose.

634
00:41:50,254 --> 00:41:52,385
We'll see.

635
00:42:00,051 --> 00:42:03,691
