1
00:00:00,100 --> 00:00:01,800
Previously on "Desperate Housewives"...

2
00:00:01,800 --> 00:00:04,800
- Turns out someone hurt her.I want them dead.
- Sometimes...

3
00:00:04,900 --> 00:00:07,600
I'm running out of money.
I'm going to be screwed.


4
00:00:07,600 --> 00:00:11,600
- You might want to think about looking for a job
- Ha
- The answers...

5
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:15,000
if you could just tell me what he told you,
then I could fix the problem.


6
00:00:15,100 --> 00:00:17,600
- I can't do that.
- To life's biggest questions...

7
00:00:17,600 --> 00:00:22,600
- I had the nightmare again
- What do you think the significanceof the name angela is?

8
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:25,300
- Actually,that's my real name
- Are buried...

9
00:00:25,300 --> 00:00:28,000
she hasn't been dead a month,
and it's like you've totally forgotten she ever existed

10
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:32,000
-...Under even bigger lies
- Zach was telling julieabout what happened to dana

11
00:00:32,400 --> 00:00:35,400
He didn't mean to kill dana

12
00:00:40,300 --> 00:00:44,300
Most mothers will tell you
their children area gift from god

13
00:00:44,800 --> 00:00:48,800
Most mothers will also tell you
that the gifts their children give them

14
00:00:48,900 --> 00:00:51,900
are less than heavenly

15
00:00:52,700 --> 00:00:55,700
Lynette had suffered through
artwork made in kindergarten

16
00:00:58,700 --> 00:01:01,700
spice racks made in summer camp

17
00:01:03,600 --> 00:01:06,600
and jewelry made at the scout jamboree

18
00:01:08,200 --> 00:01:13,200
But this day, Lynette scavo received a gift
every mother dreams of --

19
00:01:14,700 --> 00:01:17,500
one she wasn't embarrassed to display

20
00:01:17,500 --> 00:01:20,200
- Where'd you guys get this pot?
- We made it

21
00:01:20,200 --> 00:01:23,200
- Really?
- I love it

22
00:01:24,100 --> 00:01:27,100
Well, this is the nicest present
you boys have ever given me

23
00:01:28,300 --> 00:01:31,300
And you know what? I'm going to put it out on the front porch
so the whole neighborhood can enjoy it

24
00:01:33,900 --> 00:01:38,900
Lynette knew she'd cherish the memory of that moment
for the rest of her life

25
00:01:41,300 --> 00:01:44,300
The memory of that moment 
was ruined the very next day

26
00:01:52,500 --> 00:01:55,500
Mrs Mccluskey, why are you taking my flowerpot?

27
00:01:55,600 --> 00:01:57,900
- Because it's mine
Your boys stole it off my porch
- No, no, no

28
00:01:57,900 --> 00:02:00,900
My sons made that for me for valentine's day

29
00:02:01,400 --> 00:02:04,400
I bought this in costa ricaon my last cruise
You see?

30
00:02:04,400 --> 00:02:07,400
It's still gotthe price tag on it
Look

31
00:02:09,600 --> 00:02:12,600
What? Nothing more to say?
Cant get your tongue?

32
00:02:14,100 --> 00:02:17,100
You listen to me --
keep your brats off my property

33
00:02:17,800 --> 00:02:21,800
Yes, most mothers will tell you
their children area gift from god

34
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:27,000
Most motherswill also tell you

35
00:02:27,100 --> 00:02:30,100
there are some days when you wish
you could return them

36
00:03:07,900 --> 00:03:10,900
S01E14 - Love is in the air

37
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:15,000
It was the day before valentine's day,

38
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:20,000
and every man on Wisteria lane was preparing
for this most dangerous of holidays

39
00:03:21,200 --> 00:03:24,200
While some purchased romantic cards,

40
00:03:26,600 --> 00:03:29,600
and some brought home candy and flowers

41
00:03:31,100 --> 00:03:34,100
and some made dinner reservations 
at fancy restaurants

42
00:03:36,100 --> 00:03:39,100
others managed to forget about 
the day entirely

43
00:03:40,100 --> 00:03:43,000
...again

44
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:47,900
This flurry of activity was lost 
on the women of Wisteria lane

45
00:03:47,900 --> 00:03:50,900
They were busy learning a secret
about their neighbors

46
00:03:52,100 --> 00:03:55,100
a secret that was positively heartbreaking

47
00:03:56,900 --> 00:03:59,900
- So paul said that Zachary killed Dana?
- Yeah

48
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:04,000
Well, it must have been some sort of accident.
I mean, little boys don't just kill their baby sisters

49
00:04:05,500 --> 00:04:09,500
- Well, whatever it was, that boy is seriously disturbed, 
and I've forbidden Julie from hanging out with him
- Could you hold her?

50
00:04:11,200 --> 00:04:15,200
- So this is it
- This is the secret that mary alice was trying to protect

51
00:04:15,394 --> 00:04:18,100
Think of the guilt that she must have lived with

52
00:04:18,100 --> 00:04:21,100
You know, I never thought I'd say this,
but I kind of feel sorry for Paul

53
00:04:21,600 --> 00:04:23,300
I wish I could

54
00:04:23,300 --> 00:04:26,100
- I still feel like something's not right
- What do you mean?

55
00:04:26,100 --> 00:04:30,100
Well, we've all been in their house.
Have you ever seen a picture of another kid there?

56
00:04:30,100 --> 00:04:34,100
I mean, why keep dana's baby blanket 
and throw out all the photos?

57
00:04:34,200 --> 00:04:35,100
That's a good point

58
00:04:35,100 --> 00:04:39,900
We never answered why Mary Alice referred to herself
as Angela in that therapy session

59
00:04:39,900 --> 00:04:43,900
All I know is this -- Mary Alice loved Zach 
more than anything in the world

60
00:04:45,400 --> 00:04:48,100
When you love a child that much

61
00:04:48,100 --> 00:04:51,100
...you're capable of doing all sorts of things

62
00:04:55,500 --> 00:04:57,200
Yeah

63
00:05:06,100 --> 00:05:09,100
These were delivered to my house by mistake.
May I?

64
00:05:10,700 --> 00:05:13,700
They're for mary alice young

65
00:05:13,800 --> 00:05:16,800
Oh, my god

66
00:05:18,100 --> 00:05:21,727
I, uh had a standing order with the florist 
I forgot to cancel it

67
00:05:23,600 --> 00:05:26,600
Mary alice was my wife.
She passed away a few months ago

68
00:05:30,700 --> 00:05:33,400
I'm very sorryfor your loss

69
00:05:33,400 --> 00:05:36,400
- And I'm sorryfor yours
- Pardon?

70
00:05:36,700 --> 00:05:39,700
- Your sister -- Martha?
- Oh, yes

71
00:05:40,500 --> 00:05:43,500
Her

72
00:05:46,700 --> 00:05:49,700
Good lord, that's Angela

73
00:05:50,500 --> 00:05:51,900
What?

74
00:05:51,900 --> 00:05:54,700
Angela Forrest.
We worked together in Utah

75
00:05:54,700 --> 00:05:57,300
It must be 15 years ago

76
00:05:57,300 --> 00:06:00,300
I'm afraid you're mistaken.
My wife's name was mary alice

77
00:06:01,700 --> 00:06:04,700
She's never been to Utah

78
00:06:06,300 --> 00:06:11,300
Well,I could be mistaken
As I said, it's --it's been years

79
00:06:18,500 --> 00:06:21,500
No, Mickey, you're wrong
I wasn't acting like a Diva

80
00:06:21,900 --> 00:06:24,900
I left the boat show because that coordinator
was making passes at me

81
00:06:26,800 --> 00:06:29,800
I mean, it's not my fault.
Yao Lin, you missed a spot

82
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:34,000
No, spare me the lecture
and just book me another job quick

83
00:06:34,500 --> 00:06:37,500
Carlos and I are up to our asses in bills,
and we can't pay them

84
00:06:38,400 --> 00:06:41,400
Fine. Bye.

85
00:06:47,800 --> 00:06:50,100
What did you say?

86
00:06:50,100 --> 00:06:53,000
Nothing

87
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:55,700
Are you going to clean that spot?

88
00:06:55,700 --> 00:06:57,100
Which one?

89
00:06:57,100 --> 00:07:00,100
The one I told you to clean

90
00:07:00,200 --> 00:07:03,200
I'll get to it

91
00:07:11,100 --> 00:07:13,600
Clean it now

92
00:07:13,600 --> 00:07:15,300
Why?

93
00:07:15,300 --> 00:07:18,200
Because I said so

94
00:07:18,200 --> 00:07:21,200
Okay. But you've gotto say please.

95
00:07:24,700 --> 00:07:27,700
Fine, please

96
00:07:31,700 --> 00:07:34,700
Anything to get you back on your knees 
scrubbing where you belong

97
00:07:36,200 --> 00:07:39,000
You are not better than me!

98
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:40,300
Excuse me?

99
00:07:40,300 --> 00:07:45,300
The only reason you have anything in your life
 is because you're pretty

100
00:07:45,800 --> 00:07:48,800
One  day you will be old, and when that happens,
you'll be nothing

101
00:07:51,800 --> 00:07:54,800
- You are so fired

102
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:59,000
 No kidding ?

103
00:08:07,900 --> 00:08:12,800
Ooh, Valentine's day card. It's pretty.
And meticulously hand-painted.

104
00:08:12,800 --> 00:08:16,800
Whoever sent you that must really love you
and be loaded with talent

105
00:08:17,600 --> 00:08:20,600
It's beautiful. Thanks

106
00:08:21,700 --> 00:08:24,000
- So are we still on for tomorrow night?
- Oh, not only are we on,

107
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:26,900
I got reservationsat la petite fleur

108
00:08:26,900 --> 00:08:29,900
Ooh, that place is so pretentious
I've been dying to go there

109
00:08:30,700 --> 00:08:33,700
Boys! Get your little fanniesinside!

110
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:38,000
G uys?!

111
00:08:38,400 --> 00:08:42,400
Oh, poor Lynette. If she doesn't geta new 
nanny soon, she's going to implode

112
00:08:47,600 --> 00:08:50,600
Hey, guys, who you hiding from?

113
00:08:50,700 --> 00:08:53,400
Our mom. She wants to spank us

114
00:08:53,400 --> 00:08:56,400
Why, did you do something bad?

115
00:08:57,700 --> 00:09:00,700
Well, you know, if you hide out too long,
she'll get worried. Then she'll just get madder

116
00:09:00,900 --> 00:09:03,200
You know what I say? 
Go on home, take your lumps

117
00:09:03,200 --> 00:09:06,200
There's a decent chance
you'll have the rest of the day to play

118
00:09:09,300 --> 00:09:12,300
- Come on, climb aboard
- Ha ha ha. All right

119
00:09:15,900 --> 00:09:17,500
Pretty impressive!

120
00:09:17,500 --> 00:09:18,900
Well, I love kids

121
00:09:18,900 --> 00:09:21,900
- Can't wait to have my own someday
- Oh!

122
00:09:34,100 --> 00:09:37,100
We don't wantto get spanked
Yeah, we promisewe'll be good.

123
00:09:37,800 --> 00:09:40,800
Too late. You stole, and then you lied.

124
00:09:41,400 --> 00:09:42,800
Even worse,

125
00:09:42,800 --> 00:09:46,800
you made me look bad in front of Mrs Mccluskey,
who you know is mommy's sworn enemy

126
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:50,000
Time to pick your poison

127
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:53,000
How about a belt? It's a classic

128
00:09:55,100 --> 00:10:00,100
Well, we could go with the old hickory stick.
It's a cliche but it's pretty effective

129
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:05,000
I know -- we'll go with the spatula
The holes give itless wind resistance

130
00:10:05,900 --> 00:10:08,900
- Moves faster
- No! No! No! No! No! No!

131
00:10:09,900 --> 00:10:15,537
Guys, guys, guys! Hey, my hands are tied.
Thieves get spanked. Just the way it works.

132
00:10:17,600 --> 00:10:20,600
- Unless...
- Unless what?

133
00:10:21,400 --> 00:10:28,400
For a first-time offense, if you swear, cross your heart, 
that you will never,never steal again,

134
00:10:29,900 --> 00:10:33,700
and you write Mrs Mccluskeya letter of apology

135
00:10:33,700 --> 00:10:37,699
- I will let it slide
- Okay, okay! We swear! Yeah! We swear!

136
00:10:38,300 --> 00:10:41,300
All right, start with "Dear Mrs Mccluskey"

137
00:10:45,100 --> 00:10:48,100
Mommy, why are you smiling?

138
00:10:48,900 --> 00:10:51,900
- Do you know what "psychological warfare" means?
- No

139
00:10:52,600 --> 00:10:54,500
Well, too bad for you

140
00:10:54,500 --> 00:10:57,500
- Okay, start with a big "M", "c"
- Good

141
00:10:59,800 --> 00:11:02,800
Rex and I are hosting a dinner party 
for 10 next week

142
00:11:03,500 --> 00:11:06,500
We're using our best china and serving duck

143
00:11:07,600 --> 00:11:10,600
- So you and Rex are a couple again
- Yes

144
00:11:10,900 --> 00:11:13,900
You know, that's one of the things
I hated most about our separation --

145
00:11:15,200 --> 00:11:17,800
not being able to throw dinner parties

146
00:11:17,800 --> 00:11:21,800
There's just something so civilized
and elegant about them, don't you think?

147
00:11:23,000 --> 00:11:27,000
I take it you've resolved your feelings
about his infidelity?

148
00:11:27,700 --> 00:11:31,700
Let's just say I've put them in an imaginary box 
and don't plan on looking at them for a while

149
00:11:33,700 --> 00:11:37,700
Do you think that's the healthiest way
to achieve a reconciliation?

150
00:11:38,200 --> 00:11:42,200
Well, it won't be easy at first
There'll be a lotof forced smiles

151
00:11:42,800 --> 00:11:45,800
and perfunctory lovemaking,
but after a few decades whiz by,

152
00:11:46,100 --> 00:11:49,100
I'm sure I'll find a wayto forgive him

153
00:11:49,100 --> 00:11:52,100
Well, as long as you have a plan

154
00:11:55,500 --> 00:11:58,500
I do want to forgive him, Dr Goldfine, but

155
00:12:00,800 --> 00:12:03,800
there's something he's still not telling me

156
00:12:04,400 --> 00:12:07,400
Really?

157
00:12:07,800 --> 00:12:10,800
I think it has something to do with 
why he had the affair

158
00:12:11,300 --> 00:12:13,400
- Have you confronted him?
- Once

159
00:12:13,400 --> 00:12:16,400
and you should have seen the look in his eyes.
He was terrified that I'd figure it out

160
00:12:22,400 --> 00:12:25,400
You know what it is, don't you?

161
00:12:25,400 --> 00:12:28,400
Bree, I can't discuss other patients

162
00:12:28,800 --> 00:12:30,900
I realize that

163
00:12:34,600 --> 00:12:37,600
This thing that he's hiding -- is it bad?

164
00:12:46,500 --> 00:12:49,100
Haha. Maybe it's better that I don't know

165
00:12:49,100 --> 00:12:52,100
Bree, how does this reconciliation have a chance

166
00:12:52,500 --> 00:12:56,500
if the two of you can't be honest
about the innermost parts of your lives?

167
00:12:56,500 --> 00:12:59,400
We're, um, WASPS, Dr Goldfine. 
Not acknowledging...

168
00:12:59,400 --> 00:13:02,400
the elephant in the room is what we do best

169
00:13:02,700 --> 00:13:06,700
You'd settle for that --
a life filled with repression and denial?

170
00:13:09,100 --> 00:13:11,900
And the dinner parties

171
00:13:11,900 --> 00:13:14,900
Don't forgetthe dinner parties

172
00:13:17,600 --> 00:13:21,600
Hey there, over there, you got your queens
and your quad-spring series

173
00:13:22,900 --> 00:13:25,900
and your deluxe 1000s, 
all the way to the imperial paradise

174
00:13:28,800 --> 00:13:30,800
- Sweet racket, huh?
- Mm

175
00:13:30,800 --> 00:13:34,800
I swear, sometimes I wake up in the morning,
and I can't believe I'm the Siesta king

176
00:13:35,500 --> 00:13:37,900
Except for how I am

177
00:13:37,900 --> 00:13:40,900
Very impressive. Haha

178
00:13:40,900 --> 00:13:43,900
So where does the photographer 
want me for the shoot?

179
00:13:45,200 --> 00:13:48,200
Uh, didn't your agent tell you?
There's no shoot

180
00:13:48,500 --> 00:13:51,500
Well, then, what did you hire me for?

181
00:13:52,600 --> 00:13:55,600
You've heard the expression "sex sells"?

182
00:13:55,600 --> 00:13:57,200
That's where you come in

183
00:13:57,200 --> 00:14:00,200
You're here to remind people that 
there's a lot of fun thingsthey can do

184
00:14:00,700 --> 00:14:03,700
on a Siesta king mattress that 
don't involve sleeping

185
00:14:05,000 --> 00:14:06,700
Get it?

186
00:14:26,900 --> 00:14:29,900
It is often said that 
good fences make good neighbors

187
00:14:32,900 --> 00:14:35,300
But as Lynette was about to discover,

188
00:14:35,300 --> 00:14:40,300
the fence might just need a little barbed wire
if the neighbor is Mrs Mccluskey

189
00:14:47,400 --> 00:14:50,300
Hey, what do you think you are doing?
Get out of here

190
00:14:50,300 --> 00:14:53,300
Your little criminals snuck into my house
and stole my wall clock

191
00:14:54,200 --> 00:14:55,400
What?

192
00:14:55,400 --> 00:14:58,200
It was a hand-painted purple 
and white wall clock

193
00:14:58,200 --> 00:15:00,800
- My son made it
- Are you sure you didn't misplace it?

194
00:15:00,800 --> 00:15:04,800
You're getting up there in years. No offense,
but you probably forget where you put things

195
00:15:05,200 --> 00:15:08,200
No offense, but you should be sterilized

196
00:15:08,300 --> 00:15:11,300
Look, my boys do not break into people's houses

197
00:15:11,500 --> 00:15:14,500
Sure, they may have stolen your flowerpot,
but, you know,they apologized for that

198
00:15:15,500 --> 00:15:17,000
They wrote a note

199
00:15:17,000 --> 00:15:20,000
That the coward's way out.
They should have come over and apologized in person

200
00:15:20,700 --> 00:15:23,700
You  know what?This has been fun, but now --
you let those boys run wild

201
00:15:24,400 --> 00:15:27,400
Toys all over the yard,
there's bikes laying out in the street

202
00:15:27,600 --> 00:15:29,700
- It's a disgrace
- Get out of my house!

203
00:15:29,700 --> 00:15:32,700
Those boys would have been
better off raised by wolves

204
00:15:32,900 --> 00:15:35,900
- God knows, they would have been cleaner
- Ooh!

205
00:15:41,200 --> 00:15:44,200
- Valentine's dayis tomorrow
- I know

206
00:15:45,300 --> 00:15:47,800
Already bought your gifts

207
00:15:47,800 --> 00:15:49,133
Roses and english toffee?

208
00:15:49,718 --> 00:15:53,400
- Mm-hmm. Just like always
- Yes

209
00:15:53,400 --> 00:15:56,400
And I suppose we'll make love 
tomorrow night, too?

210
00:15:57,600 --> 00:15:59,900
That is our little tradition

211
00:15:59,900 --> 00:16:02,900
Good. I'm looking forward to it

212
00:16:10,900 --> 00:16:13,900
Are you looking forward to it?

213
00:16:15,100 --> 00:16:16,100
What?

214
00:16:16,100 --> 00:16:19,100
Well, it's just that I know
that I don't please you sexually,

215
00:16:19,800 --> 00:16:22,800
so I was wondering if you really were
looking forward to being with me

216
00:16:22,900 --> 00:16:25,900
- Aw, for god's sake
- I'm sorry, Rex

217
00:16:26,400 --> 00:16:29,400
I thought I could pretend
that this doesn't upset me anymore, but I can't

218
00:16:29,800 --> 00:16:32,600
- Please don't do this
- You had an affair

219
00:16:32,600 --> 00:16:35,600
You went to another woman
for sex to give you something I couldn't

220
00:16:36,200 --> 00:16:40,200
- At least have the decency
to tell me what that something is
- Bree, I can't

221
00:16:40,800 --> 00:16:43,800
Why not?

222
00:16:47,000 --> 00:16:49,400
Rex, please tell me

223
00:16:49,400 --> 00:16:52,400
Let me prove to you how much I love you

224
00:16:57,200 --> 00:17:00,200
I like to be dominated

225
00:17:04,000 --> 00:17:07,000
Sexually

226
00:17:10,300 --> 00:17:11,900
Never mind

227
00:17:11,900 --> 00:17:14,900
Rex, please, I want to understand

228
00:17:21,600 --> 00:17:24,600
- Turn your head. Don't look at me
- Please, mistress, no! Yes, slave. Yes, mistress, yes, yes

229
00:17:25,000 --> 00:17:27,900
- But, mistress --
- On your knees, now right now

230
00:17:27,900 --> 00:17:30,900
- Tighten your cuffs. Tighten them
- Yes, mistress

231
00:17:31,000 --> 00:17:34,000
- Do it now. Head down
- Yes Yes Ow! Yes!Ow! Yes!

232
00:17:35,300 --> 00:17:37,300
- Place the stickin your mouth
- Yes, mistress Yes!

233
00:17:40,400 --> 00:17:43,400
Well?

234
00:17:44,300 --> 00:17:46,700
What the hell did your mother do to you?

235
00:17:46,700 --> 00:17:48,200
What?

236
00:17:48,200 --> 00:17:50,800
Well, come on, this just reeks of 
unresolved childhood trauma

237
00:17:50,800 --> 00:17:53,800
This has nothing to do with my mother, Bree

238
00:17:54,200 --> 00:17:55,500
- This is a preference
- It's a perversion

239
00:17:55,500 --> 00:17:58,100
For god's sake, you promised to be supportive

240
00:17:58,100 --> 00:17:59,500
What do you want me to say --

241
00:17:59,500 --> 00:18:02,500
my husband likes to wear metal clamps
around his nipples, hooray?

242
00:18:03,200 --> 00:18:06,200
I want you to say you'll try it,
just -- just once

243
00:18:06,300 --> 00:18:08,400
Try what? Hurting you?

244
00:18:08,400 --> 00:18:11,400
- You actually want me to hurt you?
- So I can feel pleasure, yes

245
00:18:13,500 --> 00:18:16,500
Fine

246
00:18:17,200 --> 00:18:20,200
So was it goodfor you, too?

247
00:18:31,700 --> 00:18:33,700
Mike wants babies

248
00:18:33,700 --> 00:18:35,300
What?

249
00:18:35,300 --> 00:18:39,000
He wants to have kids,
and he had that look that men get

250
00:18:39,000 --> 00:18:42,000
that says, "I'm ready to procreate
Point me to the nearest cervix"

251
00:18:43,700 --> 00:18:46,200
And I take it this is a problem?

252
00:18:46,200 --> 00:18:48,600
Oh, I can't have another baby

253
00:18:48,600 --> 00:18:51,600
I mean, I'm so grateful I had you
You know, I don't regret a minute of that, but I --

254
00:18:53,400 --> 00:18:56,400
I found it to be completely overwhelming

255
00:18:56,500 --> 00:18:59,100
Sometimes I even wonder how I got through it

256
00:18:59,100 --> 00:19:02,100
You and me both

257
00:19:02,300 --> 00:19:05,300
- So have you told mikehow you feel?
- Oh, I can't tell him

258
00:19:05,800 --> 00:19:09,800
This could bea deal-breaker
Julie, I really love him. I don't want to lose him

259
00:19:10,800 --> 00:19:13,800
Maybe you're overreacting
I bet he'd rather have you than a baby

260
00:19:15,600 --> 00:19:18,500
What if he doesn't?

261
00:19:18,500 --> 00:19:21,500
Then that's something you need to know

262
00:19:25,100 --> 00:19:28,100
Susan shouldn't have been so worried

263
00:19:29,500 --> 00:19:32,500
Children were the last thing on mike's mind

264
00:19:33,200 --> 00:19:36,200
He was too busy searching for answers

265
00:19:36,800 --> 00:19:39,800
...in all the wrong places

266
00:20:34,900 --> 00:20:36,500
Please, just --

267
00:20:58,300 --> 00:21:00,600
You got lucky

268
00:21:00,600 --> 00:21:03,600
Didn't hit anything major

269
00:21:06,300 --> 00:21:09,300
- Noah's getting impatient
- Well, you can tell Noah I'm getting closer

270
00:21:12,500 --> 00:21:14,800
- That's her, isn't it?
- Yeah

271
00:21:14,800 --> 00:21:17,800
Hard to believe a kid from such a good family
could get so messed up

272
00:21:18,000 --> 00:21:20,300
I met somebody who recognized her photo

273
00:21:20,300 --> 00:21:23,000
They think she rented a room over on Pine Avenue

274
00:21:23,000 --> 00:21:26,000
I was checking out houses when

275
00:21:26,100 --> 00:21:28,100
Hey, mike, it's me. Are you there?

276
00:21:28,100 --> 00:21:29,500
Pick up. Hello.

277
00:21:31,300 --> 00:21:34,300
Okay, I know you're home.
Your lights are on

278
00:21:34,800 --> 00:21:39,800
Look, I really need to talk to you about something.
You know what?I-I'm just going to stop by

279
00:21:41,400 --> 00:21:44,400
Oh, hey, hey. I'm here

280
00:21:44,500 --> 00:21:45,900
- Are you okay?
- Yeah

281
00:21:45,900 --> 00:21:48,900
- I just -- ha ha --stubbed my toe
- Oh

282
00:21:53,500 --> 00:21:56,500
So can I come over?
I-I really need to talk to you about something

283
00:21:57,400 --> 00:22:00,400
Actually, I got a buddy over here right now

284
00:22:00,600 --> 00:22:03,200
Um, can it wait till dinner tomorrow?

285
00:22:03,200 --> 00:22:06,200
It's kind of important...um

286
00:22:06,300 --> 00:22:08,100
yeah, I guessit can wait

287
00:22:08,100 --> 00:22:11,100
- So see you at 7:00?
- All right I'm counting the minutes

288
00:22:15,400 --> 00:22:18,400
You should take it easy
for the next few days

289
00:22:18,600 --> 00:22:20,500
Well, I can't cancel

290
00:22:20,500 --> 00:22:23,500
The last thing I need is for her to get suspicious

291
00:22:27,900 --> 00:22:31,700
Maybe it's my dementia, but I still haven't 
found my purple wall clock

292
00:22:31,700 --> 00:22:35,700
Nobody in my family knows or cares
where your stupid clock is

293
00:22:37,500 --> 00:22:40,500
Oh, and by the way, will you tell your little criminals
to get their bikes out of the street?

294
00:22:41,100 --> 00:22:43,900
- Oh, I-I'll get it
- No, don't you dare

295
00:22:43,900 --> 00:22:46,900
We'll move it when you say please

296
00:22:58,600 --> 00:23:00,700
Please

297
00:23:00,700 --> 00:23:03,600
Okay, L-lynette, let's not get crazy

298
00:23:03,600 --> 00:23:07,600
Even thoughit was Mrs Mccluskey,
who had officially declared war,

299
00:23:08,000 --> 00:23:11,000
it was Lynette who decided to 
deliverthe opening salvo

300
00:23:12,300 --> 00:23:13,800
You're  goingto clean that up

301
00:23:13,800 --> 00:23:16,800
- You think so?
- Yes

302
00:23:19,900 --> 00:23:25,858
Yes, the war of Wisteria Lane would indeed prove 
to be messy for everyone involved

303
00:23:27,900 --> 00:23:30,900
Pardon me. Pardon me. 

304
00:23:31,600 --> 00:23:34,600
We were wondering what the 
coil count is on this one

305
00:23:34,800 --> 00:23:37,200
<i>Please do not talk to model</i>

306
00:23:39,500 --> 00:23:41,500
Sorry

307
00:23:52,300 --> 00:23:54,300
What is this?

308
00:23:54,300 --> 00:23:58,300
People keep comingand talking to me, 
asking me questions. That is not my job

309
00:23:59,000 --> 00:24:00,900
Well, you don't have to be rude

310
00:24:00,900 --> 00:24:03,900
I am not a mattress salesperson

311
00:24:04,400 --> 00:24:07,400
Is there something wrong
with being a mattress salesperson?

312
00:24:08,100 --> 00:24:11,100
- Is it beneath you or something?
- Honestly, yes

313
00:24:11,500 --> 00:24:13,300
I'm a model

314
00:24:13,300 --> 00:24:16,300
You know what? Your agent warned me
that you were a Diva, and he was right

315
00:24:17,300 --> 00:24:19,900
You won't talk to the customers,
you bitch about the coffee,

316
00:24:19,900 --> 00:24:22,900
and you wouldn't even chip in 
for hazel's birthday cake

317
00:24:23,000 --> 00:24:24,800
I just met the woman today

318
00:24:24,800 --> 00:24:27,800
That didn't stop you from having a piece

319
00:24:28,500 --> 00:24:32,500
I'm sorry, but I don't want someone
around my store that's not a team player

320
00:24:33,300 --> 00:24:36,300
- Oh, no, no, no. Wait, wait --
- You're fired, princess

321
00:24:40,000 --> 00:24:43,000
I need to know if my policy covers it

322
00:24:43,400 --> 00:24:46,400
No, my car actually wasn't involved.
It was my neighbor's car

323
00:24:47,400 --> 00:24:50,400
But the egg was mine

324
00:24:51,600 --> 00:24:54,300
Uh-huh, can I please speak to your supervisor?

325
00:24:54,300 --> 00:24:56,700
Uh, honey, can you come out here?

326
00:24:59,900 --> 00:25:02,600
What?

327
00:25:02,600 --> 00:25:05,600
Look what I found stashed in the boys' playhouse

328
00:25:14,000 --> 00:25:17,000
Please tell me that's nota purple wall clock

329
00:25:19,600 --> 00:25:22,600
Pack your bags. We're moving

330
00:25:59,700 --> 00:26:02,300
Discouraged over losing her job,

331
00:26:02,300 --> 00:26:07,300
Gabrielle decided a makeover would be 
the perfect curefor her depression

332
00:26:08,800 --> 00:26:12,800
It was after finding a moisturizer
she couldn't afford

333
00:26:13,100 --> 00:26:16,100
that it finally occurred to Gabrielle

334
00:26:18,700 --> 00:26:22,700
perhaps it was her pride 
that needed a makeover

335
00:26:25,100 --> 00:26:28,100
Excuse me, miss?

336
00:26:28,500 --> 00:26:31,500
- You forgot to give me my receipt
- Oh, right

337
00:26:33,500 --> 00:26:36,500
- Uh, oh, here, here you go
Thank you. Come again

338
00:26:46,300 --> 00:26:49,300
Mrs Solis?

339
00:26:52,800 --> 00:26:54,600
Ooh, god

340
00:26:54,800 --> 00:26:57,200
Hello

341
00:26:57,200 --> 00:27:00,200
Hello, Yao Lin. How are you?

342
00:27:00,400 --> 00:27:03,100
Good, very good

343
00:27:03,100 --> 00:27:04,800
I wanted to call you

344
00:27:04,800 --> 00:27:07,400
I felt terrible about how we left things

345
00:27:07,400 --> 00:27:09,900
I need lipstick

346
00:27:09,900 --> 00:27:12,900
- Okay, but --
- Now

347
00:27:15,900 --> 00:27:18,500
You must be loving this, huh?

348
00:27:18,500 --> 00:27:21,500
Having me serve you must be 
a dream come true

349
00:27:21,800 --> 00:27:24,300
Can't complain

350
00:27:24,300 --> 00:27:27,300
That's the difference between you and me, 
Yao Lin. Our dreams

351
00:27:28,100 --> 00:27:31,100
Close your eyes, please
Thank you

352
00:27:31,900 --> 00:27:34,900
You see, I dreamed of pulling myself up 
from nothing, and I did

353
00:27:36,100 --> 00:27:39,100
I dreamed about the things I wanted,
and I got them all 

354
00:27:39,700 --> 00:27:43,700
a high-powered career, a handsome husband,
an extravagant house

355
00:27:46,400 --> 00:27:49,400
So this is just a blip on the radar for me,

356
00:27:50,000 --> 00:27:53,000
because now I know what I'm capable of,

357
00:27:53,100 --> 00:27:56,100
and if I did it once, I can do it again

358
00:27:57,100 --> 00:28:00,448
I'm never really down, Yao lin,
even when it looks like I am

359
00:28:01,900 --> 00:28:04,900
So enjoy this moment. Enjoy your dream

360
00:28:05,300 --> 00:28:08,300
'Cause for you, it doesn't get 
any better than this

361
00:28:10,800 --> 00:28:13,800
There. Don't you look beautiful?

362
00:28:33,600 --> 00:28:36,000
Right this way

363
00:28:36,000 --> 00:28:37,500
Everything okay?

364
00:28:37,500 --> 00:28:39,500
Oh, yeah, this dress is just riding up as it is

365
00:28:39,500 --> 00:28:42,500
If I walk any faster, it'll be happy 
valentine's day for everyone

366
00:28:42,600 --> 00:28:45,600
Especially me

367
00:28:46,100 --> 00:28:47,300
Thank you

368
00:28:51,941 --> 00:28:52,956
Excuse me, miss?

369
00:29:01,300 --> 00:29:04,300
Oh, I'm so sorry! Is -- is everyone okay?

370
00:29:05,500 --> 00:29:08,500
Oh, thank you. Thank you so much

371
00:29:13,700 --> 00:29:16,700
- Oh, ma'am,your napkin
- Don't even think about it

372
00:29:29,900 --> 00:29:32,900
Oh, that's so wonderful 
what you wrote. Thank you

373
00:29:38,200 --> 00:29:42,200
I'm not going to be any type of company
until I get something off my chest

374
00:29:43,800 --> 00:29:46,800
Do you remember the other day,
when you said that you wanted to have kids?

375
00:29:50,200 --> 00:29:53,200
Here's the thing:

376
00:29:53,500 --> 00:29:56,500
I don't think I'm ready to have another baby

377
00:29:57,800 --> 00:30:00,800
I think we need to have a serious conversation

378
00:30:02,500 --> 00:30:04,200
Well, sure

379
00:30:08,800 --> 00:30:11,500
- I'm not going over there
- Yes, you are

380
00:30:11,500 --> 00:30:16,500
No, I can deal with the humiliation of going around 
to the neighborhood, returning everything the boys stole,

381
00:30:17,900 --> 00:30:20,900
but please, don't make me apologize to that woman

382
00:30:21,300 --> 00:30:24,300
Lynette, this is what it means to be a good neighbor --
finding ways of getting along

383
00:30:26,300 --> 00:30:29,300
...instead of, you know, hurling an egg at them

384
00:30:29,400 --> 00:30:33,400
But why do I have to apologize? Why don't we just go, 
"oh, now we're even," and we'll start from scratch?

385
00:30:33,700 --> 00:30:38,500
Okay, if the, uh, beinga pleasant human being argument
doesn't fly with you, we'll try, uh, self-preservation

386
00:30:38,500 --> 00:30:41,400
What if she wakes up in the middle of the night,
the house is on fire?

387
00:30:41,400 --> 00:30:42,900
You don't want her to call 911?

388
00:30:42,900 --> 00:30:46,900
If our house catches fire, I guarantee you
she's the one that started it

389
00:30:47,400 --> 00:30:50,000
My point is the day will come 
when we need her help,

390
00:30:50,000 --> 00:30:53,000
and I don't want her not to help us
just because of some silly feud

391
00:30:55,900 --> 00:30:58,700
Fine I'll do it

392
00:30:58,700 --> 00:31:00,400
Wow, thank you

393
00:31:00,400 --> 00:31:04,400
You know, whoever came up with the motto "love thy neighbor" 
clearly lived nowhere near Carolyn Mccluskey

394
00:31:06,000 --> 00:31:10,000
Yes, well, on valentine's day, the only motto 
that really matters is, you know,

395
00:31:11,300 --> 00:31:13,400
"love thy husband"

396
00:31:13,400 --> 00:31:16,400
- Really? I-I recall no such motto
- Hmm hmm

397
00:31:23,700 --> 00:31:26,600
I mean, I understand why you would want to have kids,

398
00:31:26,600 --> 00:31:30,600
but that chapter of my life is just closed
You know, I-I don't think I can go back there

399
00:31:31,600 --> 00:31:35,600
And so, you know, given the way I feel
and given the way I think you feel

400
00:31:39,400 --> 00:31:42,400
Oh, god. You're not taking this well
Oh, I was afraid of this

401
00:31:49,900 --> 00:31:51,400
what?

402
00:31:52,700 --> 00:31:54,600
I got to go

403
00:31:54,600 --> 00:31:57,000
What?

404
00:31:57,000 --> 00:32:00,000
I'm sorry

405
00:32:00,700 --> 00:32:02,700
I don't believe this

406
00:32:02,700 --> 00:32:05,600
You're -- you're leaving without even trying
to talk me into having your baby?

407
00:32:05,600 --> 00:32:08,600
I mean, how do you know I wouldn't cave?
I always cave, I --mike?!

408
00:32:21,400 --> 00:32:24,400
- Good night
- Good night

409
00:32:34,400 --> 00:32:37,400
So how does this domination thing work?

410
00:32:44,600 --> 00:32:46,900
So there's nothingto be afraid of

411
00:32:46,900 --> 00:32:49,900
I mean, mostly, we'll just be constructing 
simple scenarios and acting them out

412
00:32:51,600 --> 00:32:54,600
So it's like we're in a little play

413
00:32:54,900 --> 00:32:56,700
Sort of

414
00:32:56,700 --> 00:32:59,700
And if things do get too rough, 
we'll have a control word

415
00:32:59,800 --> 00:33:02,400
If one of us says it, 
the other backs off immediately

416
00:33:02,400 --> 00:33:05,400
Okay, so what's our control word?

417
00:33:06,000 --> 00:33:09,000
Well, lately. I've been using Philadelphia

418
00:33:12,100 --> 00:33:13,800
What's wrong?

419
00:33:13,800 --> 00:33:16,000
Well, it's just that my aunt fernlives in philadelphia,

420
00:33:16,000 --> 00:33:20,000
and I don't want to be thinking about her
while I'm spanking you with a leather strap

421
00:33:22,000 --> 00:33:25,000
Okay fine. You pick a control word

422
00:33:26,200 --> 00:33:29,200
Um, how about boise?

423
00:33:29,800 --> 00:33:32,800
- Boise?
- What's the matter with boise?

424
00:33:34,200 --> 00:33:37,200
We're going to be doing psychological 
role-playing here, Bree,

425
00:33:37,700 --> 00:33:40,500
and a funny word like boise will ruin the mood

426
00:33:40,500 --> 00:33:43,500
- We need something that sounds serious
- Hmm

427
00:33:45,500 --> 00:33:48,500
How about Palestine?

428
00:33:50,700 --> 00:33:53,700
Boise will be just fine

429
00:33:54,400 --> 00:33:57,400
So I guess we should, uh, get started

430
00:33:59,000 --> 00:34:02,000
What do you want me to do?

431
00:34:03,100 --> 00:34:05,800
Handcuff me to the bed

432
00:34:05,800 --> 00:34:08,800
Bree, you are not going to regret 
taking this journey with me

433
00:34:09,400 --> 00:34:13,400
This is going to in fuse our marriage 
with more passion than you can imagine

434
00:34:14,700 --> 00:34:17,500
You just have to trust me

435
00:34:17,500 --> 00:34:20,500
I do

436
00:34:21,900 --> 00:34:24,900
Would you mind if I ran 
these through the dishwasher once?

437
00:34:27,400 --> 00:34:28,900
Sure

438
00:34:30,600 --> 00:34:33,600
You can wait here. You can go in to see him
as soon as the doctor's finished

439
00:34:33,900 --> 00:34:36,900
Oh, okay thanks

440
00:34:38,600 --> 00:34:40,600
Can you believe that story?

441
00:34:40,600 --> 00:34:43,600
Please, there's no way that gunshot wound 
was self-inflicted

442
00:34:43,600 --> 00:34:46,400
Funny how he can't seem to remember 
who stitched him up

443
00:34:46,400 --> 00:34:49,400
Well, the police are on their way to talk to him
Let them sort it out

444
00:35:11,600 --> 00:35:14,200
Sorry about ruining dinner

445
00:35:14,200 --> 00:35:17,200
Oh, please I'm just glad you're okay

446
00:35:21,300 --> 00:35:24,300
So, you shot yourself?

447
00:35:27,200 --> 00:35:30,200
Pretty lame, huh?

448
00:35:31,300 --> 00:35:34,300
Yeah, I was just cleaning my automatic, and

449
00:35:34,700 --> 00:35:37,700
I was too embarrassed to tell you

450
00:35:38,800 --> 00:35:41,400
Well, I can see why you would be

451
00:35:41,400 --> 00:35:45,400
I know it sounds crazy I just --
I couldn't let myself ruin your valentine's day

452
00:35:48,000 --> 00:35:53,309
But I heard what you said at the restaurant 
about not wanting kids

453
00:35:53,344 --> 00:35:55,100
- We don't have totalk about that now
- No, susan

454
00:35:58,200 --> 00:36:01,200
I just want to be with you 
above everything else

455
00:36:02,800 --> 00:36:05,800
If that means not being a dad...

456
00:36:07,500 --> 00:36:10,500
I may be stupid enough to shoot myself,

457
00:36:11,800 --> 00:36:14,800
but I'm not stupid enough to 
walk away from you

458
00:36:17,400 --> 00:36:20,400
You know that, right?

459
00:36:20,400 --> 00:36:22,200
Yeah

460
00:36:27,700 --> 00:36:30,700
I'm going to go outside and
let you rest for a while

461
00:36:35,900 --> 00:36:38,200
Thanks

462
00:36:38,200 --> 00:36:41,200
for being so understanding

463
00:36:56,500 --> 00:37:00,500
Ma'am. Excuse me, Mr Delfino,
I'm officer Russell. This is officer Walters

464
00:37:01,300 --> 00:37:04,300
I'd like to ask you a few questions. Sir, if you feel up to it

465
00:37:21,600 --> 00:37:24,600
What do you want?

466
00:37:25,100 --> 00:37:28,100
The boys have something
they'd like to say to you

467
00:37:32,800 --> 00:37:37,507
I have some tea heating on the stove.
Perhaps you'd better come inside, boys

468
00:37:44,400 --> 00:37:47,400
What about you, Lynette? 
Do you have anything to say?

469
00:37:48,300 --> 00:37:51,300
No. I'll just wait out here

470
00:37:52,400 --> 00:37:54,400
Suit yourself

471
00:38:02,900 --> 00:38:05,900
You boys want some peanut brittle?

472
00:38:05,900 --> 00:38:07,900
Go ahead

473
00:38:07,900 --> 00:38:10,900
Don't get any crumbson my floor.
Move over

474
00:38:14,600 --> 00:38:17,600
Okay. Go ahead.
Make with the apology

475
00:38:20,000 --> 00:38:22,900
We're sorry

476
00:38:22,900 --> 00:38:25,600
That's it, huh?

477
00:38:25,600 --> 00:38:28,600
Didn't you know that stealing is wrong?

478
00:38:28,600 --> 00:38:30,100
How old are you, anyway?

479
00:38:30,100 --> 00:38:31,400
We're 6

480
00:38:31,400 --> 00:38:34,400
- And how old are you?
- 5

481
00:38:34,800 --> 00:38:37,800
Well, your mother just pops them out, 
doesn't she?

482
00:38:38,000 --> 00:38:40,400
How old are you?

483
00:38:40,400 --> 00:38:42,100
How old do you think?

484
00:38:42,100 --> 00:38:45,100
150

485
00:38:45,200 --> 00:38:48,200
Hurry up and eat your peanut brittle

486
00:38:52,900 --> 00:38:55,900
Who's that?

487
00:38:58,200 --> 00:39:00,600
That's my little boy

488
00:39:00,600 --> 00:39:03,600
Where does he live?

489
00:39:04,000 --> 00:39:06,000
He died when he was 12

490
00:39:06,000 --> 00:39:07,900
How come?

491
00:39:07,900 --> 00:39:10,700
He got sick

492
00:39:10,700 --> 00:39:13,700
He was a little terror like you three

493
00:39:16,100 --> 00:39:19,100
You would have liked him

494
00:39:19,800 --> 00:39:22,800
Now, are you done with the peanut brittle?

495
00:39:22,800 --> 00:39:25,800
Let's go

496
00:39:28,100 --> 00:39:31,100
Now, I want to say something
to you before you go

497
00:39:31,200 --> 00:39:33,900
What you did was wrong,

498
00:39:33,900 --> 00:39:36,900
but it's nice that you wanted to get a present 
for your mom for valentine's day

499
00:39:40,300 --> 00:39:43,300
Nobody's ever going to 
love you like your mother

500
00:39:44,700 --> 00:39:46,500
All right, let's go

501
00:39:49,500 --> 00:39:51,600
Get the hell out of my house

502
00:39:51,600 --> 00:39:55,600
In her heart, Lynette knew she would 
probably never love her neighbor,

503
00:39:56,700 --> 00:40:02,607
never realizing that love was the one thing
she and her neighbor had in common

504
00:40:15,771 --> 00:40:22,322
- Hey
- Hey, Lynette, what's wrong?

505
00:40:23,900 --> 00:40:28,900
My kids have beenon kind of a thieving jag,
stealing stuff from around the neighborhood

506
00:40:29,400 --> 00:40:31,200
I'm so sorry

507
00:40:31,200 --> 00:40:34,200
I know. They're being punished, 
probably for life

508
00:40:34,800 --> 00:40:37,800
But I needed you to see something

509
00:40:39,200 --> 00:40:43,200
They said they stole it from Mike's garage,
from inside his workbench. Your Mike?

510
00:40:49,800 --> 00:40:52,200
So?

511
00:40:52,200 --> 00:40:55,200
Read the engraving

512
00:41:01,300 --> 00:41:03,500
Is that blood?

513
00:41:03,500 --> 00:41:06,300
I don't know

514
00:41:06,300 --> 00:41:09,300
What --what does this mean?

515
00:41:09,500 --> 00:41:12,500
I don't know

516
00:41:21,200 --> 00:41:25,200
It's impossible to grasp 
just how powerful love is

517
00:41:26,800 --> 00:41:29,800
It can sustain us through trying times

518
00:41:34,000 --> 00:41:38,000
or motivate us to make extraordinary sacrifices

519
00:41:41,100 --> 00:41:45,100
It can force decent men 
to commit the darkest deeds

520
00:41:47,400 --> 00:41:50,400
or compel ordinary women

521
00:41:51,500 --> 00:41:54,500
to search for hidden truths

522
00:41:56,100 --> 00:41:59,100
And long after we're gone,
love remains...

523
00:42:00,600 --> 00:42:03,600
burned into our memories

524
00:42:05,800 --> 00:42:08,700
We all search for love,

525
00:42:08,700 --> 00:42:11,700
but some of us, after we've found it,

526
00:42:14,100 --> 00:42:17,100
wish we hadn't

527
00:42:17,101 --> 00:42:18,895
