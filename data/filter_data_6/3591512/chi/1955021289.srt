13
00:02:17,940 --> 00:02:20,010
那中介就应该不会把我的名字给你

14
00:02:20,060 --> 00:02:21,890
我打字和速记的能力不够好

那就是助理

28
00:02:50,780 --> 00:02:54,090
这座岛本该是一些好莱坞影星买下的
Some Hollywood film star was supposed to have bought it,

29
00:02:54,140 --> 00:02:56,610
相反 却是欧文夫妇买下了

30
00:02:57,780 --> 00:02:59,010
你见过他们吗?
You've met them?

31
00:02:59,060 --> 00:03:01,490
没有 只有信件来往
No, everything by letter.

32
00:03:01,540 --> 00:03:03,210
一座岛?

33

114
00:13:57,620 --> 00:13:59,210
我说的是整场安排
I mean, this whole arrangement.

115
00:13:59,260 --> 00:14:03,530
欧文夫妇邀请我来这见我的朋友 而她却不在这里
The Owens invited me here to meet my friend and she's not even here.

116
00:14:03,580 --> 00:14:06,500
非常奇怪 真是奇怪得很
Very strange. Very strange indeed.

117
00:14:08,580 --> 00:14:11,580
- 需要帮忙吗? 我扶你  - 你太好了
- Can I help you? Here.  - Oh, too kind.

118
00:15:11,516 --> 00:15:16,440
十个士兵小男孩 为了吃饭去奔走
噎死一个没法救 十个只剩九

119
00:16:32,300 --> 00:16:34,180
别来烦我
Leave me alone.

120
00:16:49,580 --> 00:16:51,370
看看你这样子
Look at the state of you.

121
00:16:51,420 --> 00:16:53,170
我要去给牛肉抹油了
I've got to baste my beef.

122
00:16:53,220 --> 00:16:55,650
还有我的蛋奶酥 托马斯 我的蛋奶酥怎么办?
And my souffles, Thomas, what about my souffle?

123
00:16:55,700 --> 00:16:58,290
我又不能给她更衣 对吧?
Well, I can't dress her, can I?

124
00:16:58,340 --> 00:16:59,820
快去
Go on.

125
00:17:08,460 --> 00:17:11,000
是童年阴影吗?
Was it a childhood affliction?

126
00:17:12,220 --> 00:17:13,760
你的眼睛?
Your eyes?

127
00:17:15,540 --> 00:17:17,210
不是的 夫人
No, madam.

128
00:17:17,260 --> 00:17:19,330
突然出现的症状
Came on all suddenly.

129
00:17:19,900 --> 00:17:23,530
受到惊吓? 生活巨变?
Oh... Shock, maybe? Sudden change?

130
00:17:23,580 --> 00:17:26,680
对不起 夫人 我不知道
Begging your pardon, madam, I don't know.

131
00:17:27,620 --> 00:17:29,530
你一定知道
You must know.

132
00:17:29,580 --> 00:17:32,380
对不起 夫人 我不知道
Begging your pardon, madam, I don't.

133
00:17:35,700 --> 00:17:38,410
我一直认为 会轻易
I always think it's rather a weakness,

134
00:17:38,460 --> 00:17:41,620
受周围环境影响 是一种懦弱
to be so affected by something in one's circumstances.

135
00:17:42,700 --> 00:17:45,300
要不就是放纵 徒劳无功
Rather indulgent, almost vain.

136
00:17:47,420 --> 00:17:52,010
我们要坚强 罗杰斯太太 尤其是这种时期
We must be strong, Mrs Rogers, especially in these times.

137
00:17:52,060 --> 00:17:54,130
要勇敢...
We must be valiant...

138
00:17:54,980 --> 00:17:56,780
也要秉持道德
and virtuous.

139
00:17:59,260 --> 00:18:01,660
我们要做英国女人
And we must be Englishwomen.

140
00:18:02,980 --> 00:18:04,370
好的 夫人
Yes, madam.

141
00:18:04,420 --> 00:18:06,560
给你一点建议... 
And a little advice...

142
00:18:06,940 --> 00:18:10,860
以后 上楼服侍女士们之前...
in future, a splash of Eau de Cologne...

143
00:18:12,220 --> 00:18:15,970
喷一点古龙香水
before you come upstairs to attend on the ladies.

144
00:18:16,020 --> 00:18:18,610
我自然明白在厨房工作的艰辛不易
I appreciate it's hot, working in the kitchen,

145
00:18:18,660 --> 00:18:21,980
但无需如此明显地表现出来
but there's no need to announce it quite so emphatically.

146
00:18:24,980 --> 00:18:27,120
对不起 夫人
Beg your pardon, madam.

147
00:18:34,580 --> 00:18:36,250
罐头食品
Tinned goods.

148
00:18:37,220 --> 00:18:40,210
部队 战争 战争
Troops. War. The war.

149
00:18:40,260 --> 00:18:41,930
罐头食品
Tinned goods.

150
00:18:45,900 --> 00:18:49,820
沃格雷夫法官 拙劣的自我介绍让你见笑了
Judge Wargrave, I'm terribly sorry for the clumsy introduction.

151
00:18:51,820 --> 00:18:55,420
我不太习惯旅行 完全失了该有的风度
I'm a terrible traveller, completely lose my bearings.

152
00:18:58,860 --> 00:19:00,450
我们没迟到吧?
Are we on time?

153
00:19:00,500 --> 00:19:02,290
正好赶上
Only just.

154
00:19:02,340 --> 00:19:03,820
先生
Ah, sir.

155
00:19:04,820 --> 00:19:08,170
您这么快就准备妥当了呀
You're ready sooner than we'd anticipated.

156
00:19:08,220 --> 00:19:10,970
- 楼上是什么?  - 只是阁楼 先生
- What's up there?  - Just roof space, sir.

157
00:19:11,020 --> 00:19:12,730
先生... 主人和我说过
Ah, sir... I've been advised

158
00:19:12,780 --> 00:19:15,770
楼上的地板不是很牢固
that the footing isn't particularly sturdy up there.

159
00:19:15,820 --> 00:19:18,610
最好不要上去 以免害您一不小心
Best avoided, lest you make an unexpected entrance

160
00:19:18,660 --> 00:19:20,490
进了别人的卧室 先生... 
into one of the bedrooms, sir...

161
00:19:20,540 --> 00:19:22,680
还是从天花板掉进去的
by way of the ceiling.

162
00:19:24,620 --> 00:19:27,050
我领您去休息室吧 先生?
May I show you to the drawing room, sir?

163
00:19:27,100 --> 00:19:30,370
在等待其他宾客时给您来杯餐前酒如何?
Perhaps an aperitif, whilst you await the other guests?

164
00:19:30,420 --> 00:19:32,220
戴维斯先生
Ah... Mr Davis.

165
00:19:37,660 --> 00:19:40,050
看起来你需要喝一杯啊
You look like a man who could use a drink.

166
00:19:40,100 --> 00:19:44,300
真是不谋而合 一小杯即可
Hmm! How very congenial. Perhaps a small... snifter.

167
00:19:46,260 --> 00:19:48,460
罗杰斯先生 请带路
Mr Rogers, lead the way.

168
00:20:52,660 --> 00:20:54,140
小姐?
Miss?

169
00:20:58,420 --> 00:21:01,620
您在找什么吗 小姐?
Is there something you're looking for, Miss?

170
00:21:01,980 --> 00:21:04,920
这里是地下室 小姐
Because this is the belowstairs, Miss.

171
00:21:06,060 --> 00:21:07,890
只有工作人员可进
For staff.

172
00:21:07,940 --> 00:21:09,730
我就是工作人员
Well, I am staff.

173
00:21:09,780 --> 00:21:11,970
小姐 我们有非常严格的规定
Miss, we had very strict instructions

174
00:21:12,020 --> 00:21:14,770
要将你当作宾客招待
that you were to be treated as a guest.

175
00:21:14,820 --> 00:21:17,930
宾客不能到楼下来
Guests don't come below stairs.

176
00:21:17,980 --> 00:21:21,100
但是听起来好像你是在赶我走
It rather sounds as though you're asking me to leave.

177
00:21:24,500 --> 00:21:28,000
欧文夫妇还邀请了多少人?
How many more are you expecting, with the Owens?

178
00:21:28,260 --> 00:21:30,290
等他们都到了就知道了
We shall know when they arrive.

179
00:21:30,340 --> 00:21:33,810
那只有你们两个人 怎么应付得来?
And how will you cope, just the two of you?

180
00:21:33,860 --> 00:21:36,410
罗杰斯和我很能干
Rogers and myself is competent.

181
00:21:36,460 --> 00:21:38,000
足够能干了
More than.

182
00:21:39,700 --> 00:21:41,860
那可以请您上楼了吗?
So, if you please?

183
00:22:01,220 --> 00:22:03,020
干得漂亮 姑娘
Well done, girl.

184
00:22:14,860 --> 00:22:17,060
多么悠然的晚上啊
What an idyllic evening.

185
00:22:18,060 --> 00:22:19,730
看这苍穹!
The sky!

186
00:22:19,780 --> 00:22:22,650
怎么会有人不相信这是造物主的杰作?
How can one not believe in a creator?

187
00:22:24,140 --> 00:22:25,250
我是戴维斯
Davis.

188
00:22:25,300 --> 00:22:26,410
我是埃米莉·布伦特
Emily Brett.

189
00:22:26,460 --> 00:22:28,330
爱德华·阿姆斯特朗
Edward Armstrong.

190
00:22:39,900 --> 00:22:42,300
我的房间里也有一个
There's one in my room, too.

191
00:22:43,340 --> 00:22:46,370
我猜每个房间都有一个
I imagine there's one in every room.

192
00:22:46,420 --> 00:22:50,090
这是士兵岛嘛 不奇怪
Well... Soldier Island. It makes sense.

193
00:22:50,140 --> 00:22:51,610
挺有趣的
It's amusing.

194
00:22:51,660 --> 00:22:55,540
我强烈怀疑这里的主人擅长幻想
I have a strong suspicion our hosts are inclined to whimsy.

195
00:22:57,420 --> 00:23:00,090
我不能评论我们的主人
I cannot comment on our hosts.

196
00:23:00,140 --> 00:23:02,280
多好的小秘书
Good little secretary.

197
00:23:03,060 --> 00:23:05,210
抱歉
Excuse me.

198
00:23:05,260 --> 00:23:08,460
我们相识的方式不太对 是吧?
We've got off on the wrong foot, haven't we?

199
00:23:08,940 --> 00:23:10,490
但是你确实有双美腿
But you do have very pretty legs.

200
00:23:10,540 --> 00:23:13,780
- 不欣赏可就太暴殄天物了  - 隆巴德先生...
- It would have been remiss not to admire them.  - Mr Lombard...

201
00:23:15,140 --> 00:23:18,260
你似乎已经认定了我是某种样子的女人
you seem to be under the impression that I am a particular kind of woman.

202
00:23:19,380 --> 00:23:21,920
但我保证 我绝不是
And I assure you that I am not.

203
00:23:22,260 --> 00:23:25,010
我不喜欢被人盯着看
I do not like to be looked at.

204
00:23:25,060 --> 00:23:27,530
我看人的直觉很准
I get instincts about people.

205
00:23:29,060 --> 00:23:31,400
我对你就有种直觉
I've an instinct about you.

206
00:23:32,820 --> 00:23:35,160
我觉得你在伪装
I think you're pretending.

207
00:23:38,660 --> 00:23:40,890
要喝酒吗 马斯顿先生?
A drink, Mr Marston?

208
00:23:40,940 --> 00:23:43,740
苦味杜松子酒 粉如处子的脸颊
Pink gin. Pink as a virgin's blush.

209
00:23:45,460 --> 00:23:48,660
- 我不知道你的名字  - 菲利普·隆巴德
- Didn't catch your name.  - Philip Lombard.

210
00:23:49,420 --> 00:23:52,220
爱尔兰人 你一定认识克莱索恩一家
Irish. You must know the Corkerons.

211
00:23:53,220 --> 00:23:54,930
我的好朋友
Great chums of mine.

212
00:23:54,980 --> 00:23:56,730
无比与人为善
Endlessly simpatico.

213
00:23:56,780 --> 00:23:58,610
有点名气的人都知道他们
Anyone who's anyone knows them.

214
00:24:03,540 --> 00:24:06,290
你爱打赌吗 隆巴德?
Are you a betting man, Lombard?

215
00:24:06,340 --> 00:24:07,730
看情况
It depends.

216
00:24:07,780 --> 00:24:09,250
今天晚上某个时刻
At some point this evening,

217
00:24:09,300 --> 00:24:12,170
那些老不死的家伙中的一个总会谈论起战争
one of those crumbling old roaks will start talking about the war.

218
00:24:12,220 --> 00:24:15,610
然后他会来问你是否遗憾自己错过了上一场战争
And then he'll ask us both if we aren't damned sorry to have missed the last one

219
00:24:15,660 --> 00:24:18,690
下一场战争又该如何共同合作 尽责报国
and how we should be gung ho to do our duty in the next.

220
00:24:18,740 --> 00:24:21,290
但不会有下一场战争的
Not that there's going to be a next one.

221
00:24:21,340 --> 00:24:23,890
总是会有下一场战争
There's always a next one.

222
00:24:23,940 --> 00:24:26,500
那你怎么说? 赌吗?
So, how about it? A bet?

223
00:24:31,460 --> 00:24:33,600
赢的可能性太小了
The odds are too short.

224
00:24:40,180 --> 00:24:42,490
听听他们 喋喋不休地讨论着过往
Listen to them. Clinging on.

225
00:24:42,540 --> 00:24:44,770
他们还觉得自己很了不起
They think they still mean something

226
00:24:44,820 --> 00:24:48,580
但哪怕他们死了 也绝不会有人发现或在乎...
but nobody at all would notice, or care, if they just...

227
00:24:50,940 --> 00:24:54,340
我会对他们释放无比魅力的
I'm going to be exceptionally charming to them.

228
00:24:58,300 --> 00:25:00,250
好吧 克莱索恩小姐
Oh, all right, Miss Claythorne.

229
00:25:00,300 --> 00:25:03,620
抱歉 我不该盯着你看 这下你该开心点了吧
If it'll make you happy, I'm sorry for staring.

230
00:25:06,020 --> 00:25:08,050
隆巴德先生
Mr Lombard,

231
00:25:08,100 --> 00:25:11,040
我觉得你从不会对任何事感到抱歉
I doubt you're ever sorry for anything.

232
00:25:14,580 --> 00:25:16,120
聪明姑娘
Smart girl.

233
00:25:48,740 --> 00:25:52,130
女士们先生们 龙虾蛋奶酥
Ladies and gentlemen, lobster souffle.

234
00:25:52,180 --> 00:25:54,490
但愿不要太油腻
I hope it isn't too rich.

235
00:25:54,540 --> 00:25:57,280
我在家吃饭都很清淡
I always dine so modestly at home.

236
00:26:02,300 --> 00:26:04,240
我不用 谢谢
I won't, thank you.

237
00:26:05,540 --> 00:26:06,930
谢谢
Thank you.

238
00:26:06,980 --> 00:26:09,250
我们以前见过 是吗?
We've met before, you know?

239
00:26:09,300 --> 00:26:12,210
抱歉 我的记忆力已经大不如前了
Oh, forgive me, my memory is not what it was.

240
00:26:12,260 --> 00:26:14,690
也许你以前给过我证据?
Perhaps you gave evidence before me?

241
00:26:14,740 --> 00:26:17,290
不 如果是这样 我会记得的
No, no, it wasn't that, I'd remember that.

242
00:26:17,340 --> 00:26:19,410
一定是别的事...
It's something else...

243
00:26:19,460 --> 00:26:21,210
我会记起来的
It'll come to me.

244
00:26:21,260 --> 00:26:23,210
我看不明白这些东西
I'm not at all sure about these.

245
00:26:23,260 --> 00:26:25,650
这东西看起来很... 怪异
They look very... pagan.

246
00:26:25,700 --> 00:26:29,770
它们是十个小士兵 那首诗歌里提到的
They're the ten little soldiers. You know, from the poem.

247
00:26:29,820 --> 00:26:32,530
我能背得出那诗
Hmm. I know it off by heart.

248
00:26:32,580 --> 00:26:35,490
我小的时候 我奶奶背给我听过
When I was a little boy, my nanny used to recite it to me.

249
00:26:35,540 --> 00:26:39,250
我觉得她是用这首诗来吓我 想让我乖一点
I imagine she wanted to terrify me into being good.

250
00:26:39,300 --> 00:26:40,650
起作用了吗?
Did it work?

251
00:26:40,700 --> 00:26:43,770
当然 我一直都很一丝不苟
Well, I've always been a stickler, yes.

252
00:26:43,820 --> 00:26:45,610
对规章制度一丝不苟
Stickler for the rules.

253
00:26:45,660 --> 00:26:48,330
可能我是个迟钝的孩子吧!
I was probably a rather dull boy!

254
00:26:48,380 --> 00:26:50,890
这我可想象不出来 将军
I really can't imagine that, General.

255
00:26:50,940 --> 00:26:54,610
不过 你不该称它为诗歌 克莱索恩小姐
Although, you shouldn't call it a poem, Miss Claythorne.

256
00:26:54,660 --> 00:26:56,450
它算是打油诗
It's doggerel.

257
00:26:56,500 --> 00:26:58,210
诗歌应当令人振奋
Poetry should be uplifting.

258
00:26:58,260 --> 00:26:59,890
我同意你的观点 布伦特小姐
I agree with you, Miss Brent.

259
00:26:59,940 --> 00:27:02,490
看看第一印象错得有多离谱
Well, that shows how wrong first impressions are.

260
00:27:02,540 --> 00:27:05,730
我认为你不是那种会欣赏诗歌的男子
I didn't think you were the type of gentleman to appreciate poetry.

261
00:27:05,780 --> 00:27:08,580
戴维斯先生意外的很有深度
Mr Davis has hidden depths.

262
00:27:11,580 --> 00:27:13,690
蛋奶酥很好吃
The souffle is delicious.

263
00:27:13,740 --> 00:27:15,540
口感很轻盈
Mmm, very light.

264
00:27:24,980 --> 00:27:28,690
在40多年的刑法执法生涯中 我面对过
In over 40 years in criminal law, I have come face to face

265
00:27:28,740 --> 00:27:32,410
最堕落邪恶的人类 却心无恐惧
with the most depraved examples of mankind and felt no fear.

266
00:27:32,460 --> 00:27:35,130
但看到年轻小姐挥舞着曲棍
But I quail in terror, Miss Claythorne,

267
00:27:35,180 --> 00:27:38,410
克莱索恩小姐 我心里怕极了
at the thought of young ladies brandishing hockey sticks.

268
00:27:38,460 --> 00:27:43,250
她们没那么坏 法官先生 只是有时有点兴奋过头 有些吵闹
They're not so bad, Judge. A little over-excited and noisy, sometimes.

269
00:27:43,300 --> 00:27:46,250
真是年轻人的特点
Oh, the prerogative of youth.

270
00:27:46,300 --> 00:27:49,330
我确信你可以为她们树个好榜样
And I'm sure you set them a very fine example.

271
00:27:49,380 --> 00:27:52,570
有时你会害怕他们会端上来什么糟糕的菜品
Sometimes, you dread what filth they're going to serve,

272
00:27:52,620 --> 00:27:55,810
- 但这菜还挺不错的  - 欧文夫妇是非常慷慨的主人
- but this is actually very decent.  - The Owens are always generous hosts.

273
00:27:55,860 --> 00:27:57,770
他们是你的朋友吗 戴维斯先生?
Friends of yours, Mr Davis?

274
00:27:57,820 --> 00:28:00,170
是生意伙伴
Business acquaintances.

275
00:28:00,220 --> 00:28:01,850
我做罐头生意
I'm in tinned goods.

276
00:28:01,900 --> 00:28:05,530
给军队提供炖菜起的家
The firm started off supplying troops with stew.

277
00:28:05,580 --> 00:28:07,810
罐头食品帮我们赢得了战争
Tinned goods is what helped us win the war.

278
00:28:07,860 --> 00:28:11,490
我猜... 吃饱饭才能打胜仗
Well, I suppose... I suppose an army marches on its stomach.

279
00:28:11,540 --> 00:28:12,970
开始了...
Here we go...

280
00:28:13,020 --> 00:28:15,210
天啊 我记得那炖菜
God, I remember that stew.

281
00:28:15,260 --> 00:28:17,690
我猜是皇家军队医疗队吧 阿姆斯特朗医生?
RAMC, I presume, Dr Armstrong?

282
00:28:17,740 --> 00:28:18,930
没错
That's right.

283
00:28:18,980 --> 00:28:22,450
在比利时和法国的伤员运输站和医院工作
Clearing stations and then hospitals in Belgium and France.

284
00:28:22,500 --> 00:28:25,450
也许你也被采访过了吧
Perhaps you're being interviewed as well.

285
00:28:25,500 --> 00:28:27,290
什么采访 将军?
Interviewed, General?

286
00:28:27,340 --> 00:28:32,530
欧文先生虽不是军人 却是个博学多识的军事历史学家
Yes, Mr Owen is an amateur, but very knowledgeable military historian.

287
00:28:32,580 --> 00:28:34,210
他在写有关法国
He's writing about France,

288
00:28:34,260 --> 00:28:38,090
- 1917年时前线决定性决策的书  - 天啊 终于结束了
- about the decisive actions on the Front in 1917.  - Oh, for God's sake, it's over.

289
00:28:38,140 --> 00:28:41,330
没有 我... 来这里就是为了逃开那些的
No, I'm, er... I'm just here to get away from it all.

290
00:28:41,380 --> 00:28:45,050
欧文先生是个有趣的男人... 名字也很有趣
Interesting man, Mr Owen... and an interesting name.

291
00:28:45,100 --> 00:28:46,690
尤利克·诺尔曼
Ulick Norman.

292
00:28:46,740 --> 00:28:50,530
真奇怪 欧文太太的名字是尤纳·南希...
How funny. Mrs Owen is Una Nancy...

293
00:28:50,580 --> 00:28:52,090
首字母一样
Matching initials.

294
00:28:52,140 --> 00:28:55,850
我得承认 我对"尤利克"这名字有点忧虑
Must confess, I was a little worried about the "Ulick".

295
00:28:55,900 --> 00:28:59,860
现下的形势下 这看起来有点像... 日耳曼人的名字
Given the current climate, it might be seen as somewhat... Teutonic.

296
00:29:00,900 --> 00:29:03,690
他可是最爱国的人
You couldn't hope to meet a more patriotic man.

297
00:29:03,740 --> 00:29:06,780
况且还能有什么名字比"诺曼"更像英国人呢?
And what could be more English than "Norman"?

298
00:29:14,660 --> 00:29:17,660
太神奇了!
Oh, it's magical!

299
00:29:19,380 --> 00:29:21,170
罗杰斯太太很有天赋
Mrs Rogers has the gift.

300
00:29:21,220 --> 00:29:24,540
她也许看上去像僵尸 但菜做得很不错
She might look like the undead, but she can definitely cook.

301
00:29:27,020 --> 00:29:29,490
欧文夫妇什么时候到?
When might we expect the Owens?

302
00:29:29,540 --> 00:29:31,490
他们没打来电话吗?
Have they not telephoned?

303
00:29:31,540 --> 00:29:34,730
这岛上没有电话 夫人
There's no telephone on the island, Madam.

304
00:29:34,780 --> 00:29:36,250
纳拉科特先生每天早上
Mr Narracott brings messages,

305
00:29:36,300 --> 00:29:38,850
送邮件和食材来的时候 会带信来
along with the post and kitchen supplies every morning.

306
00:29:38,900 --> 00:29:42,250
我想明天他就会带着欧文夫妇的电报
I imagine tomorrow, he will either bring a telegram from the Owens,

307
00:29:42,300 --> 00:29:44,640
或他们本人过来
or they will accompany him.

308
00:29:45,460 --> 00:29:48,010
对了 罗杰斯 给那个纳拉科特几先令
Ah-ah, Rogers, give that Narracott chap a couple of bob,

309
00:29:48,060 --> 00:29:49,970
让他替我看下车
ask him to watch my car.

310
00:29:50,020 --> 00:29:52,810
车就停在港口
It's parked up by the harbour.

311
00:29:52,860 --> 00:29:54,050
延森牌的
The Jensen.

312
00:29:54,100 --> 00:29:55,770
当然可以 先生
Of course, sir.

313
00:29:55,820 --> 00:29:59,220
我也会向罗杰斯太太转告您的赞美
I shall pass on your compliments to Mrs Rogers.

314
00:30:00,300 --> 00:30:03,450
听我说 戴维斯 欧文夫妇...
Look here, Davis. The Owens...

315
00:30:03,500 --> 00:30:06,770
他们是喜爱热闹的人吗?
Are they fun-loving types?

316
00:30:06,820 --> 00:30:08,210
"喜爱热闹"?
"Fun-loving"?

317
00:30:08,260 --> 00:30:10,450
没错 因为这里有些事不对劲
Yeah, cos there's something a tad off here.

318
00:30:10,500 --> 00:30:14,100
听着 我收到了一封信 邀请我参加派对
Now, I had a letter inviting me to a house party.

319
00:30:14,980 --> 00:30:18,050
是年轻人会玩的 懂吗? 香槟 音乐...
Pretty young things, you know? Champagne, music...

320
00:30:18,100 --> 00:30:20,970
但除了这位似乎可以在开心些的隆巴德
And apart from Lombard, who looks like he could cut up a bit lively,

321
00:30:21,020 --> 00:30:25,850
你们其他人似乎都不是喜欢热闹派对的人
the rest of you don't really look like fun-loving house party types.

322
00:30:25,900 --> 00:30:27,770
我无疑冒犯
No offence.

323
00:30:27,820 --> 00:30:29,530
那延森牌的车是你的?
Your car, the Jensen?

324
00:30:29,580 --> 00:30:32,970
你看到了? 她是不是很美?
Oh, you saw her? Isn't she a beauty?

325
00:30:33,020 --> 00:30:35,330
说实话 我无法想象我会爱一个人
I honestly can't imagine loving a person

326
00:30:35,380 --> 00:30:37,730
甚于崇拜爱戴延森车
as much as I worship and adore the Jensen.

327
00:30:37,780 --> 00:30:40,130
你把我逼下了路
You ran me off the road.

328
00:30:40,180 --> 00:30:41,850
我没有
No, I didn't.

329
00:30:42,660 --> 00:30:44,860
你把我逼下了路
You ran me off the road.

330
00:30:46,700 --> 00:30:48,090
什么时候?
When?

331
00:30:48,140 --> 00:30:51,170
我当时正自顾自好好开车 结果你超我车...
I was driving along, minding my own business, when you overtook me...

332
00:30:51,220 --> 00:30:53,890
天知道你开得有多块... 然后就把我逼下了路
going God knows how fast... and you ran me off the road.

333
00:30:53,940 --> 00:30:56,290
我看到有人以可悲的龟爬速度...
Well, I saw someone going at a pitiful speed...

334
00:30:56,340 --> 00:30:57,610
好了 听着 马斯顿...
Now, look here, Marston...

335
00:30:57,660 --> 00:31:00,290
我觉得眼下这情形 你道个歉再握个手
I think an apology and a handshake between gentlemen

336
00:31:00,340 --> 00:31:02,050
是最好不过的了
would be just the thing here.

337
00:31:02,100 --> 00:31:04,730
- 但我并没有做错事!  - 你把我逼下了路!
- But I haven't done anything wrong!  - You ran me off the road!

338
00:31:04,780 --> 00:31:07,570
我也许是超了你的车 但我姨妈开车都比你带劲
I might have over-taken you, but my great aunt drives with more zip.

339
00:31:07,620 --> 00:31:09,050
如果你没法控制自己的车
And if you can't control your car,

340
00:31:09,100 --> 00:31:11,850
- 那就真的不应该开车了...  - 你个小混蛋!
- then you really shouldn't be behind the wheel...  - You little shit!

341
00:31:11,900 --> 00:31:13,170
你把我逼下了路
You ran me off the road

342
00:31:13,220 --> 00:31:15,690
竟然还有脸跟我说那是我的错?!
and then you have the temerity to tell me it's my fault?!

343
00:31:15,740 --> 00:31:18,250
冷静点 老小子 你脸都有点红了
Careful, old boy. Getting a little red in the face there.

344
00:31:18,300 --> 00:31:21,610
拜托了 二位! 还有女士在场呢
Gentleman, please! There are ladies present.

345
00:31:21,660 --> 00:31:23,200
抱歉
I'm sorry.

346
00:31:24,940 --> 00:31:26,410
这周太辛苦了
It's been a long week.

347
00:31:26,460 --> 00:31:28,370
你说得对 将军
You're right, General.

348
00:31:28,420 --> 00:31:30,960
应该绅士间握个手
A handshake between gentlemen.

349
00:31:31,540 --> 00:31:34,210
快点 阿姆斯特朗 来握一下
Come on, Armstrong. Put it there.

350
00:31:35,900 --> 00:31:37,640
我们做朋友吧
Let's be pals.

351
00:32:07,780 --> 00:32:09,450
快到时间了
Nearly there.

352
00:32:10,860 --> 00:32:12,600
干得不错
Good work, eh?

353
00:32:14,060 --> 00:32:15,730
罗杰斯 我没烟了
Rogers, I'm out of cigarettes.

354
00:32:15,780 --> 00:32:17,490
好的 先生
Yes, sir.

355
00:32:17,540 --> 00:32:19,850
你参加过那些战役 将军?
So, what battles were you involved with, General?

356
00:32:19,900 --> 00:32:23,330
我在西北边境服过役
Well, I served on the North West frontier,

357
00:32:23,380 --> 00:32:25,890
还有南非和法国
in South Africa, and of course, in France.

358
00:32:25,940 --> 00:32:28,660
- 赢过吗?  - 我讨厌这个习俗...
- Win any?  - I loathe this convention...

359
00:32:28,820 --> 00:32:31,870
留男人在那里抽烟聊天
leaving men to their cigars and their "stories".

360
00:32:31,920 --> 00:32:33,410
恰是习俗 克莱索恩小姐
Convention, Miss Claythorne,

361
00:32:33,460 --> 00:32:37,100
使我们在迫在眉睫的混乱前保持团结
is what keeps us together in the face of impending chaos.

362
00:32:38,940 --> 00:32:40,370
到时间了吗?
Is it time?

363
00:32:40,420 --> 00:32:42,360
你先端过去
You start serving.

364
00:32:53,220 --> 00:32:55,610
不 不 我来倒咖啡
No, no. No, I'll pour the coffee.

365
00:32:55,660 --> 00:32:58,570
你厨房那儿一定很忙
You must be very busy in the kitchen.

366
00:32:58,620 --> 00:32:59,890
多谢小姐
Miss.

367
00:33:00,860 --> 00:33:03,330
晚餐很不错 罗杰斯太太
Excellent dinner, Mrs Rogers.

368
00:33:04,180 --> 00:33:06,780
欧文夫妇能请到你真是幸运
The Owens are lucky to have you.

369
00:33:07,140 --> 00:33:08,690
我一定会告诉他们的
I'll certainly be telling them so.

370
00:33:08,740 --> 00:33:10,610
谢谢您 夫人
Thank you, Madam.

371
00:33:20,220 --> 00:33:22,560
你上班的学校在哪儿?
Whereabouts is your school?

372
00:33:23,500 --> 00:33:26,570
我想您应该没听说过 那学校并不出名
I doubt you'd have heard of it. It's not particularly well-known.

373
00:33:26,620 --> 00:33:28,970
也不怎么出色
Nor particularly good, either.

374
00:33:29,020 --> 00:33:30,530
您为什么这么说?
Why do you say that?

375
00:33:30,580 --> 00:33:34,090
不然 你也就不会在夏天出来找工作了
Otherwise, you would not be needing employment in the summer months.

376
00:33:34,140 --> 00:33:36,810
他们的学费不够高 付的工资也就不够高
Their fees are not high enough, nor is their pay.

377
00:33:36,860 --> 00:33:40,370
倒不是我不赞同你找工作充实时光...
Not that I disapprove of you seeking employment and being busy...

378
00:33:40,420 --> 00:33:42,020
我很赞同
far from it.

379
00:33:42,940 --> 00:33:45,850
但为什么要在个三流学校
But why teach in a third-rate establishment,

380
00:33:45,900 --> 00:33:49,290
教三流的女学生呢?
producing third-rate girls?

381
00:33:49,340 --> 00:33:52,530
我觉得她们不值得你花时间和精力上去
Barely worth your time and attention, I would have thought.

382
00:33:52,580 --> 00:33:55,090
女士们 先生们!
Ladies and gentlemen!

383
00:33:55,140 --> 00:33:56,610
请肃静!
Silence, please!

384
00:33:56,660 --> 00:33:58,290
是谁在说话?
Who is that?

385
00:33:58,340 --> 00:34:01,840
你们被指控犯有以下罪名
You are charged with the following indictments.

389
00:34:15,100 --> 00:34:17,330
- 这是谁?  - 这是什么意思?
- Who is this?  - What's the meaning of this?

390
00:34:17,380 --> 00:34:21,890
威廉·亨利·布洛尔 你谋杀了詹姆斯·斯蒂芬·兰道...
William Henry Blore, that you did murder James Stephen Landor...

391
00:34:21,940 --> 00:34:23,610
上帝啊!
God almighty!

392
00:34:24,780 --> 00:34:27,650
维拉·伊丽莎白·克莱索恩

东非部落的土著人
members of an East African tribe.

396
00:34:41,940 --> 00:34:45,170
约翰·戈登·麦克阿瑟 你谋杀了亨利·里奇蒙...
John Gordon MacArthur, that you did murder Henry Richmond...

397
00:34:45,220 --> 00:34:47,930
这声音是从哪儿来的?
Where is this coming from?

398
00:34:47,980 --> 00:34:53,410
- 安东尼·詹姆斯·马斯顿 你谋杀了约翰和露西·库姆斯...  - 我们走 罗杰斯
- Anthony James Marston, that you did murder John and Lucy Coombes...  - Let's go, Rogers.

399
00:34:53,460 --> 00:34:55,050
我从没听到过这个
I never heard of them.

400
00:34:55,100 --> 00:34:58,330
劳伦斯·约翰·沃格雷夫
Lawrence John Wargrave,

401
00:34:58,380 --> 00:35:01,450
你谋杀了爱德华·塞顿
that you did murder Edward Seton.

402
00:35:01,500 --> 00:35:02,970
让开
Get out of my way.

403
00:35:03,020 --> 00:35:05,250
托马斯和埃塞尔·罗杰斯...
Thomas and Ethel Rogers...

404
00:35:05,300 --> 00:35:08,300
你们谋杀了詹尼弗·布雷迪
that you did murder Jennifer Brady.

405
00:35:11,060 --> 00:35:14,610
- 托马斯?  - 狱中的罪犯们...
- Thomas?  - Prisoners at the bar...

406
00:35:14,660 --> 00:35:16,800
你们是否认罪?
how do you plead?

407
00:35:39,260 --> 00:35:41,530
哦... 罗杰斯太太?
Oh... Mrs Rogers?

408
00:35:41,580 --> 00:35:43,890
- 她只是晕过去了  - 我去拿我的包
- She just took a turn.  - I'll go fetch my bag.

409
00:35:43,940 --> 00:35:47,010
- 她会没事的  - 这事我说了算
- She'll be all right.  - I'll be the judge of that.

410
00:35:47,060 --> 00:35:50,050
- 唱片?  - 还叫告别演出
- A record?  - It's called Swan Song.

411
00:35:50,100 --> 00:35:52,930
他们到底在玩什么?
What the hell are they playing at?

412
00:35:52,980 --> 00:35:55,730
嗯? 他们到底在玩什么?
Huh? What the hell are they playing at?

413
00:35:55,780 --> 00:35:58,330
- 放开我!  - 该死的欧文夫妇 他们想玩什么?
- Get off me!  - The damn Owens, what's their game?

414
00:35:58,380 --> 00:36:01,900
放开他 马斯顿 他根本不认识他们 他不是戴维斯
Put him down, Marston, he doesn't know them. He's not Davis.

415
00:36:13,420 --> 00:36:14,890

直觉
Instinct.

419
00:36:22,580 --> 00:36:24,320
我去喝杯酒
I need a drink.

420
00:36:25,460 --> 00:36:29,050
真是的! 这些荒诞的虚假指控!
Really! These grotesque, false accusations!

421
00:36:29,100 --> 00:36:31,370
正是 将军!
Indeed, General!

422
00:36:31,420 --> 00:36:33,690
我们应该等医生和罗杰斯过来
We should wait for the doctor and Rogers.

423
00:36:33,740 --> 00:36:35,770
我们应该等大家都到场
We should wait until everyone is together.

424
00:36:35,820 --> 00:36:39,660
说得好 探长 我们都听警察的话吧
Well said, Tubs. Let's all listen to the policeman.

425
00:36:48,740 --> 00:36:50,540
克莱索恩小姐?
Miss Claythorne?

426
00:37:16,140 --> 00:37:17,450
给
Here.

427
00:37:17,500 --> 00:37:20,440
这药很温和 但能助眠
It's mild, but it will help you sleep.

428
00:37:33,780 --> 00:37:36,850
罗杰斯 我猜有些关于这里主人的问题
I suspect, Rogers, that there are questions about our hosts

429
00:37:36,900 --> 00:37:39,130
只有你能回答
that only you can answer.

430
00:37:39,180 --> 00:37:40,650
是 先生
Yes, sir.

431
00:37:41,900 --> 00:37:44,330
那给你几分钟 宽慰下你的妻子
A few minutes, then, to settle your wife.

432
00:37:44,380 --> 00:37:45,660
多谢先生
Sir.

433
00:37:51,860 --> 00:37:53,400
我早就说了!
I told you!

434
00:37:55,300 --> 00:37:57,370
我早就说了...
I told you...

435
00:37:57,420 --> 00:37:59,210
镇静下来 女人!
Pull yourself together, woman!

436
00:37:59,260 --> 00:38:02,260
别想着耍花样 迟钝的婊子
Stop flapping your trap, you dozy bitch.

437
00:38:04,740 --> 00:38:05,890
谢谢
Thank you.

438
00:38:05,940 --> 00:38:07,810
罗杰斯马上过来
Rogers is coming.

439
00:38:13,860 --> 00:38:15,650
罗杰斯
Well, Rogers?

440
00:38:15,700 --> 00:38:17,970
看... "根据我的指示...
See... "On my instructions...

441
00:38:18,020 --> 00:38:20,410
在特定的时间播放唱片"
Put the record on at such a time".

442
00:38:20,460 --> 00:38:24,370
他们说这是个惊喜 是个派对的游戏
We were told it was to be a surprise, a party game.

443
00:38:24,420 --> 00:38:27,370
- 派对游戏!  - 但你当时和我们在一起
- Some party game!  - But you were in the room with us.

444
00:38:27,420 --> 00:38:29,930
唱片有延迟效果
There's a delay on the record.

445
00:38:29,980 --> 00:38:33,180
有人为此花了很多时间和功夫
Somebody went to a lot of time and expense.

446
00:38:34,060 --> 00:38:36,170
如果我知道唱片里的内容
If I'd known what was on the record,

447
00:38:36,220 --> 00:38:38,290
就绝不会参与这件事
I'd never have been a part of it.

448
00:38:38,340 --> 00:38:41,610
里面对我和罗杰斯太太的指控? 绝不属实!
What is said about me and Mrs Rogers? Never!

449
00:38:41,660 --> 00:38:43,660
所以根本不是真的?
Nothing in it, then?

450
00:38:44,340 --> 00:38:47,290
布雷迪小姐就像我们的家人
Miss Brady were like family to us.

451
00:38:47,340 --> 00:38:49,680
我们为她尽心尽力
We did everything for her.

452
00:38:50,220 --> 00:38:52,370
她身体不好 非常虚弱
She weren't well. Frail as a bird.

453
00:38:52,420 --> 00:38:55,850
但她在账户里给我们留了一小笔遗产...
But on account of how she left us a small legacy...

454
00:38:55,900 --> 00:38:59,250
某些人就开始对此口不择言了
Well, some folk will say anything to hurt.

455
00:39:24,220 --> 00:39:28,290
恐怕我得说家庭服务的圈子里嫉妒横生
There's a lot of jealousy amongst domestic service, I'm afraid to say.

456
00:39:28,340 --> 00:39:31,570
地下室里就是一窝阴险狡诈的人
Below stairs is very often a nest of vipers.

457
00:39:31,620 --> 00:39:35,580
谢谢你 罗杰斯 如果我们有需要会打电话给你
Thank you, Rogers. We'll ring if we require anything further.

458
00:39:42,260 --> 00:39:45,810
我经常会遇到懒惰且怀恨在心的仆人
I've had more than my fair share of lazy and vindictive staff.

459
00:39:45,860 --> 00:39:49,160
- 我相信罗杰斯  - 但这说不通啊
- I believe Rogers.  - Doesn't make any sense.

460
00:39:49,660 --> 00:39:53,690
我根本没见过什么约翰和露西·库姆斯
I've never even met a John and Lucy Coombes.

461
00:39:53,740 --> 00:39:55,680
真是充满恶意的荒唐话
Malicious nonsense.

462
00:39:56,980 --> 00:39:59,780
路易莎·克利斯是个来做手术的病人
Louise Clees was a surgical patient.

463
00:40:00,780 --> 00:40:04,130
手术很复杂 有危险性 大家都明白的
It was risky, there were complications. Everyone knew that.

464
00:40:04,180 --> 00:40:07,090
但真等出事的时候 大家都会把错怪到医生身上
But the moment anything goes wrong, it's "blame the bloody surgeon".

465
00:40:07,140 --> 00:40:08,770
没人责怪你 医生
No-one's blaming you, Doctor.

466
00:40:08,820 --> 00:40:10,210
但某人在责怪我!
Well, someone is!

467
00:40:10,260 --> 00:40:13,930
亨利·里奇蒙是我手下最棒的年轻警官之一
Henry Richmond was one of my finest young officers,

468
00:40:13,980 --> 00:40:19,050
在为国家履行神圣使命的时候壮烈牺牲
who fell in the pursuit of his gallant duty for King and Country.

469
00:40:19,100 --> 00:40:24,210
竟有人听信这些卑鄙的谣言 真是可恶...
It is repugnant that these vile rumours should be given credence...

470
00:40:24,260 --> 00:40:25,610
可恶至极!
Repugnant!

471
00:40:25,660 --> 00:40:27,860
爱德华·塞顿有罪
Edward Seton was guilty.

472
00:40:28,860 --> 00:40:33,370
我认可了一些不能纳入呈堂证供的证据
I was party to evidence that was not admissible before the court.

473
00:40:33,420 --> 00:40:35,290
但他的确有罪
But he was guilty.

474
00:40:35,340 --> 00:40:39,530
我唯一碰到兰道的时候 就是给他上手铐的时候
The only time I laid hands on Landor was to put handcuffs on him.

475
00:40:39,580 --> 00:40:42,180
他是个堕落的酒鬼
He was a degenerate and a drunk.

476
00:40:43,060 --> 00:40:45,400
被自己的呕吐物噎死了
He choked on his own puke.

477
00:40:45,500 --> 00:40:48,580
西里尔... 那个小男孩...
Cyril... The little boy...

478
00:40:49,660 --> 00:40:51,660
我是他的保姆
I was his governess.

479
00:40:52,980 --> 00:40:56,280
他不应该去游泳的 他还不够强壮
He wasn't supposed to swim, he wasn't strong.

480
00:40:57,460 --> 00:41:00,900
但他溜了出去 我...
But he sneaked off and I...

481
00:41:01,940 --> 00:41:04,480
我也不是很擅长游泳
I wasn't a good enough swimmer.

482
00:41:04,820 --> 00:41:07,160
我就是不够优秀
I just wasn't good enough.

483
00:41:07,940 --> 00:41:09,810
我试了
I tried.

484
00:41:09,860 --> 00:41:12,200
我真的试过想救他
I really tried to save him.

485
00:41:12,780 --> 00:41:15,980
他可怜的母亲崩溃了 彻底崩溃了
His poor mother was broken, she was so broken.

486
00:41:17,740 --> 00:41:20,170
我... 也是被别人救上来的
I... I had to be rescued.

487
00:41:20,220 --> 00:41:22,090
我差点淹死
I almost drowned.

488
00:41:23,140 --> 00:41:25,370
什么人会这样说话呢?
Who could say something like this?

489
00:41:25,420 --> 00:41:27,650
某种恶意的玩笑
Some sort of vicious joke.

490
00:41:27,700 --> 00:41:29,450
如果你们觉得这很幽默
Well, if that's your sense of humour,

491
00:41:29,500 --> 00:41:31,410
那你们的脑子一定有些问题
there's something wrong with your wiring.

492
00:41:31,460 --> 00:41:33,010
滑稽剧时间到了
Time for the funny farm.

493
00:41:33,060 --> 00:41:35,800
我那指控倒完全属实
It was pinpoint accurate about me.

494
00:41:36,620 --> 00:41:37,960
21个人?
21 men?

495
00:41:39,740 --> 00:41:42,540
我就知道有人会瞎说
I always thought someone would blab.

496
00:41:44,260 --> 00:41:46,890
真是神奇 某些人安安稳稳地
It's amazing how people get an attack of conscience

497
00:41:46,940 --> 00:41:49,770
躺自家床上睡觉 竟会突然良心发现
when they're safely tucked away in their beds.

498
00:42:05,540 --> 00:42:07,740
你这个可怕的男人!
You terrible man!

499
00:42:08,420 --> 00:42:11,410
真是个可怕至极的男人!
You terrible, terrible man!

500
00:42:11,460 --> 00:42:13,410
就是你这样的人...
It's people like you...

501
00:42:13,460 --> 00:42:15,410
你这样的男人...
men like you...

502
00:42:15,460 --> 00:42:18,370
害我们的传教士身陷险境!
that put our missionaries in such danger!

503
00:42:18,420 --> 00:42:23,210
你们的传教士 带着上帝和梅毒!
Oh, your missionaries, with their God and their syphilis!

504
00:42:23,260 --> 00:42:26,890
我可不是唯一在非洲杀了人的白人 布伦特小姐
I am not the only white killer in Africa, Miss Brent.

505
00:42:26,940 --> 00:42:29,410
隆巴德先生 你是个该死的侩子手!
Lombard, you, sir, are a bloody butcher!

506
00:42:29,460 --> 00:42:31,770
我也对此供认不讳
And I'm holding my hands up to it.

507
00:42:31,820 --> 00:42:35,530
所以 要么就是我为了吓吓各位编了这个故事
So, either I'm embellishing a story for shocking effect,

508
00:42:35,580 --> 00:42:39,490
要么这房间里都是骗子 我是唯一说了实话的人
or I'm the only one telling the truth in a room full of liars.

509
00:42:39,540 --> 00:42:41,850
- 你怎么敢!  - 收回那句话 先生!
- How dare you!  - Take that back, sir!

510
00:42:41,900 --> 00:42:44,730
请别说了 女士们先生们 别说了!
Enough, please, ladies and gentlemen. Enough!

511
00:42:44,780 --> 00:42:46,450
这有什么好处呢?
What good can it do?

512
00:42:46,500 --> 00:42:48,970
我认为我们应该回房休息
My feeling is that we should retire

513
00:42:49,020 --> 00:42:52,130
准备好明天和纳拉科特先生一起离开
and be ready to leave tomorrow with Mr Narracott.

514
00:42:52,180 --> 00:42:53,770
如果欧文夫妇和他一起来了呢?
What if the Owens are with him?

515
00:42:53,820 --> 00:42:56,500
我们当面对质 但依旧要离开
We confront them, but we leave.

516
00:42:58,660 --> 00:43:03,060
哪怕隆巴德先生供认了可怕的罪行...
And despite Mr Lombard's devastating confession...

517
00:43:04,500 --> 00:43:07,440
我们都是这出残忍骗局的受害者
we are all victims of a cruel hoax.

518
00:43:08,340 --> 00:43:11,930
我们不应再多争论 夸大这些控诉
We shouldn't dignify these accusations with any more debate.

519
00:43:11,980 --> 00:43:12,990
同意吗?
Agreed?

520
00:43:12,990 --> 00:43:14,290
- 当然  - 附议
- Certainly.  - Hear, hear.

521
00:43:14,340 --> 00:43:18,060
约翰和露西·库姆斯... 一定是那两个孩子
John and Lucy Coombes... they must have been those two kids.

522
00:43:19,700 --> 00:43:23,090
我是说看在上帝的份上 哪种父母会让孩子晚上在外面玩?
I mean, what sort of parents let kids play out in the dark, for God's sake?

523
00:43:23,140 --> 00:43:25,680
这太不负责任了
It's completely irresponsible.

524
00:43:26,580 --> 00:43:29,570
我为此被吊销驾照六个月 真是个麻烦事
I lost my license for six months. It was a terrific nuisance.

525
00:43:29,620 --> 00:43:32,730
噢 原来你当时在开车呀 真让人意外!
Oh, you were driving, were you? What a surprise!

526
00:43:32,780 --> 00:43:35,520
那完全是运气不好 仅此而已
It was jolly bad luck, that's all.

527
00:43:38,020 --> 00:43:40,700
我根本躲不过的
No, I didn't stand a chance.

528
00:43:53,220 --> 00:43:55,530
那俩可怜的孩子...
Those poor children...

529
00:43:55,580 --> 00:43:57,970
你就是个该死的疯子 马斯顿!
You're a bloody maniac, Marston!

530
00:43:58,020 --> 00:44:00,170
我根本就没开多快
I wasn't even driving that fast.

531
00:44:00,220 --> 00:44:01,650
你在英格兰不能开那么快
You can't, not in England.

532
00:44:01,700 --> 00:44:05,010
但欧洲大陆就不一样了 我是说他们理解飙车的真谛
It's not like the Continent. I mean, they understand motoring over there.

533
00:44:05,060 --> 00:44:08,130
无论你们怎么评价德国佬都好 但他们的路棒极了
Say what you like about the Krauts, but their roads are magnificent.

534
00:44:08,180 --> 00:44:09,370
延森车爱死那路了
The Jensen loves them.

535
00:44:09,420 --> 00:44:12,090
我完全可以放开速度 随她奔驰
I can really open her up and let her rip.

536
00:44:16,380 --> 00:44:20,050
- 没事吧?  - 他噎住了!
- All right?  - He's choking!

537
00:44:22,100 --> 00:44:24,170
他吐血了!
He's bleeding!

538
00:44:24,220 --> 00:44:26,960
- 让他躺地上!  - 把他扶开!
- Get him down!  - Get him off me!

539
00:44:45,540 --> 00:44:47,080
他死了
He's dead.

540
00:44:50,900 --> 00:44:57,100
天上的父啊 请看顾这身陷痛苦的灵魂 保护我们...
Heavenly father, watch over this soul in torment and protect us...

541
00:45:11,060 --> 00:45:12,930
阿姆斯特朗
Armstrong.

542
00:45:12,980 --> 00:45:14,520
过来
Come here.

543
00:45:29,180 --> 00:45:32,010
好吧 处于对他家人的尊重
Well, perhaps we ought to get rid of the stimulant,

544
00:45:32,060 --> 00:45:33,810
也许我们应该扔了这些兴奋剂
out of respect to the family.

545
00:45:33,860 --> 00:45:36,370
可不想惹上丑闻啊
Don't want to cause a scandal.

546
00:45:36,420 --> 00:45:38,890
这事归警察管了 医生
It's a police matter now, Doctor.

547
00:45:38,940 --> 00:45:42,040
无论身份是否尊贵 规矩都是一样的
Same set of rules, if you're posh or not.

548
00:45:43,860 --> 00:45:45,400
那好吧
Very well.

549
00:46:09,180 --> 00:46:11,250
我们死定了 托马斯
We're damned, Thomas.

550
00:46:12,660 --> 00:46:14,330
死定了
We're damned.

551
00:46:18,340 --> 00:46:20,340
我们要下地狱了!
We're going to hell!

552
00:46:42,860 --> 00:46:44,060
谁?
Yes?

553
00:46:52,220 --> 00:46:53,930
是谁?
Who is it?

554
00:47:48,540 --> 00:47:50,290
医生 求你了!
Doctor, please!

555
00:47:50,340 --> 00:47:51,850
别碰我
Don't touch me.

556
00:47:51,900 --> 00:47:54,040
我知道自己在干什么
I know what I'm doing.

557
00:48:38,060 --> 00:48:39,770
阿姆斯特朗医生?
Dr Armstrong?

558
00:48:39,820 --> 00:48:42,450
嗯 什么事?
Yes? What is it?

559
00:48:42,500 --> 00:48:44,570
您能跟我来一下吗?
Can you come, please?

560
00:48:59,220 --> 00:49:01,760
她已经死了几个小时了
She's been dead for some hours.

561
00:49:04,620 --> 00:49:06,930
我...
I'll, er...

562
00:49:06,980 --> 00:49:10,170
鉴于现在的情况 我去通知其他人别对早餐
I'll inform the others not to expect too much in the way of breakfast,

563
00:49:10,220 --> 00:49:12,420
抱太大期望了
given the circumstances.

564
00:49:13,100 --> 00:49:14,500
不用 先生
No, sir.

565
00:49:16,140 --> 00:49:18,740
我们会提供全套早餐的
Full breakfast will be provided.

566
00:49:21,540 --> 00:49:23,010
你很敬业
Good man.

567
00:49:24,060 --> 00:49:26,860
最好别细想 保持忙碌
Best not to dwell. Keep busy.

568
00:50:14,100 --> 00:50:15,770
阿姆斯特朗医生
Dr Armstrong.

569
00:50:17,300 --> 00:50:19,240
我听到你起床了
I heard you get up.

570
00:50:20,300 --> 00:50:21,770
罗杰斯太太的情况恶化了吗?
Has Mrs Rogers got worse?

571
00:50:21,820 --> 00:50:23,970
算是吧 她死了
Somewhat. She's dead.

572
00:50:24,020 --> 00:50:25,770
- 死了?  - 在睡梦里死掉的
- Dead?  - Died in her sleep.

573
00:50:25,820 --> 00:50:29,520
她去得很平和 不用太过担心
It was quite peaceful. Nothing to be alarmed about.

574
00:50:29,900 --> 00:50:31,490
等等
Wait.

575
00:50:31,540 --> 00:50:33,090
等等 我...
Wait, I, er...

576
00:50:33,140 --> 00:50:36,380
我下来等你的时候看到了这个 请跟我来
I came down here to wait for you and I saw this. Please.

577
00:50:44,820 --> 00:50:47,620
现在才来告别吻太晚了吧 探长
Bit late for the kiss of life, Tubs.

578
00:50:49,940 --> 00:50:52,250
你真是个聪明鬼
Smart arse, you are.

579
00:50:52,300 --> 00:50:54,440
你自己闻闻
Have a sniff yourself.

580
00:50:54,900 --> 00:50:57,970
- 本来有十个瓷像  - 和童谣里说的一样 没错
- There were ten of them.  - From the nursery rhyme, the poem? Yes.

581
00:50:58,020 --> 00:51:01,320
对 请你数一下 阿姆斯特朗医生
Yes. Count them for me, please, Dr Armstrong.

582
00:51:03,700 --> 00:51:06,330
现在是八个 对吧?
There are eight, aren't there?

583
00:51:06,380 --> 00:51:09,380
八个瓷像 象征着这里的八个人
Eight figures for the eight people here.

584
00:51:09,820 --> 00:51:11,970
告诉我 我没数错
Tell me I'm right.

585
00:51:12,020 --> 00:51:13,930
请告诉我 我没数错!
Please tell me I'm right!

586
00:51:13,980 --> 00:51:17,460
我想这事一定有个非常合理的解释
I'm sure there is a perfectly rational explanation for this.

587
00:51:20,660 --> 00:51:21,930
杏仁味
Almonds.

588
00:51:21,980 --> 00:51:23,850
才不是什么杏仁味
Almonds be buggered.

589
00:51:23,900 --> 00:51:25,300
是氰化物
Cyanide.

590
00:51:26,860 --> 00:51:30,690
我相信你不会对着我们歇斯底里吧 克莱索恩小姐
I trust you're not going to unravel on us, Miss Claythorne.

591
00:51:30,740 --> 00:51:33,280
疯女人太无聊了
Hysterical women are so boring.

592
00:51:42,700 --> 00:51:46,850
谢谢你去救他 谢谢你尽力了 谢谢你 谢谢你
Thank you for trying, thank you for trying, thank you, thank you,

593
00:51:46,900 --> 00:51:51,260
谢谢你尽力了 天啊 天啊 天啊...
thank you for trying, oh, God. Oh, God. Oh, God. Oh, God...

594
00:51:56,700 --> 00:51:59,250
我想游到礁石那边去!
I want to swim to the rocks!

595
00:51:59,300 --> 00:52:01,970
西里尔亲爱的 你知道不行 你还不够强壮
Cyril, darling, you know you can't. You're not strong enough.

596
00:52:02,020 --> 00:52:03,810
- 够强壮了!  - 西里尔 听话
- I am!  - Cyril, behave yourself.

597
00:52:03,860 --> 00:52:05,450
听克莱索恩小姐的话 亲爱的
Listen to Miss Claythorne, dearest.

598
00:52:05,500 --> 00:52:06,730
不要!
No!

599
00:52:06,780 --> 00:52:10,090
这真是太调皮了! 真是抱歉 克莱索恩小姐
That's incredibly naughty! I'm so sorry, Miss Claythorne.

600
00:52:10,140 --> 00:52:11,970
天啊 他怎么就那么激动
Oh, dear. He's getting all worked up.

601
00:52:12,020 --> 00:52:14,490
西里尔 你会害自己生病的
Cyril, you'll make yourself ill.

602
00:52:14,540 --> 00:52:16,610
这是怎么了?
What's all this, now?

603
00:52:17,260 --> 00:52:18,650
雨果叔叔!
Uncle Hugo!

604
00:52:18,700 --> 00:52:22,690
我大老远就能听到你在叫 你这个小淘气
I can hear you shouting from miles away, you young rascal.

605
00:52:22,740 --> 00:52:25,010
感谢上帝... 你来得正是时候
Oh, thank heavens... in the nick of time.

606
00:52:25,060 --> 00:52:28,130
奥利维亚 你和往常一样光彩四射
Olivia, you look absolutely radiant, as ever.

607
00:52:28,180 --> 00:52:31,740
空洞的奉承话 我都晒红了 样子可笑极了
Empty flattery. I'm completely raddled and utterly hideous.

608
00:52:33,460 --> 00:52:35,690
我想我还不认识这位小姐
I don't believe I've had the pleasure.

609
00:52:35,740 --> 00:52:37,610
雨果 这位是克莱索恩小姐
Hugo, this is Miss Claythorne,

610
00:52:37,660 --> 00:52:40,700
她在学校经常帮忙照顾西里尔
who was doing so much to help Cyril in the schoolroom.

611
00:53:40,220 --> 00:53:43,020
你去踏浪了吗 将军?
Have you been for a paddle, General?

612
00:53:44,620 --> 00:53:46,760
你是什么人 隆巴德?
What are you, Lombard?

613
00:53:48,860 --> 00:53:50,460
雇佣兵?
A mercenary?

614
00:53:51,140 --> 00:53:53,250
杀手?
Gun for hire?

615
00:53:53,300 --> 00:53:54,840
士兵?
A soldier?

616
00:53:55,980 --> 00:54:01,650
你并不隶属于我所知的任何军队 但仍是某种士兵
Not from any army I'd recognise, but still, a soldier of sorts.

617
00:54:01,700 --> 00:54:04,700
你不必担心我是什么人
You don't need to worry about what I am.

618
00:54:05,180 --> 00:54:07,490
总有那么一瞬间 对吧?
There's always a moment, isn't there?

619
00:54:07,540 --> 00:54:12,940
在袭击 进攻 轰炸和混乱前...
Before the attack, the advance, the bombardment, the chaos...

620
00:54:14,620 --> 00:54:16,960
总有一瞬间的死寂
a moment of absolute calm.

621
00:54:19,220 --> 00:54:20,690
听着...
Listen...

622
00:54:21,780 --> 00:54:26,220
现在是不是很像那个瞬间?
doesn't this feel like that moment?

623
00:54:30,540 --> 00:54:33,340
我从不是个寻求安稳的人 将军
I was never a man for calm, General.

624
00:54:36,660 --> 00:54:39,400
我们从这里看不到港口
We can't see the harbour from here.

625
00:54:39,980 --> 00:54:42,520
也就意味着他们看不见我们
Which means they can't see us.

626
00:54:43,460 --> 00:54:45,200
我们被断了退路
We are cut off.

627
00:54:46,180 --> 00:54:48,050
是一窝被困住的老鼠
Rats in a barrel.

628
00:54:50,220 --> 00:54:54,620
这就是大屠杀前的片刻宁静
This is the peace before the carnage.

629
00:55:02,420 --> 00:55:04,730
人不会无缘无故死去!
People do not just die for no reason!

630
00:55:04,780 --> 00:55:08,050
他们会死 是因为有人对他们做了什么事
They die because something was done to them by someone.

631
00:55:08,100 --> 00:55:10,370
有个爱尔兰人拿着枪坐在那儿!
There's a Fenian sat over there with a bloody gun!

632
00:55:10,420 --> 00:55:12,850
没人会来救我们 一切都完了
No-one's coming for us. This is the end.

633
00:55:12,900 --> 00:55:14,530
你敢碰我的私人物品!
Don't you dare touch my possessions!

634
00:55:14,580 --> 00:55:16,370
你想藏匿什么东西?
What have you got to hide?

635
00:55:16,420 --> 00:55:20,050
一整个早上都在收拾内脏... 你胆子还真够大的
The whole morning, clearing up guts... you've got some right brass neck.

636
00:55:20,100 --> 00:55:23,290
我们都被盯上了
We are all being hunted.

637
00:55:23,340 --> 00:55:25,610
这个岛上还有其他人
There's someone else on this island,

638
00:55:25,660 --> 00:55:28,620
等我找到他 我就让他做我手下第22个亡魂
and when I find him, I'm going to make him number 22.
