1
00:00:16,650 --> 00:00:18,140
God, I love seeing you laugh.

2
00:00:18,140 --> 00:00:21,590
Oh, well, it's been a long time  
Since I've been in the mood to. Thank you.

3
00:00:21,590 --> 00:00:24,450
<I>Persistence paid off</I>   
<I>for Susan's new friend.</I>

4
00:00:24,450 --> 00:00:26,750
You're gonna leave me out here  
in the middle of nowhere?

5
00:00:26,750 --> 00:00:30,270
<I>And Bree began to regret</I>   
<I>what she had done.</I>

6
00:00:31,760 --> 00:00:35,510
<I>Orson Hodge dreamed</I>  
<I>of the perfect honeymoon.</I>

7
00:00:35,510 --> 00:00:37,550
<I>Indeed, he'd begun planning it</I>

8
00:00:37,550 --> 00:00:41,570
<I>the moment Bree Van De Kamp</I>   
<I>agreed to marry him.</I>

9
00:00:41,570 --> 00:00:44,660
<I>They'd start by flying</I>  
<I>first class</I>

10
00:00:45,090 --> 00:00:48,190
<I>to an exclusive 5-star hotel</I>

11
00:00:48,690 --> 00:00:51,470
<I>where they'd spend</I>   
<I>their days by the pool</I>

12
00:00:51,860 --> 00:00:54,460
<I>and their nights making love.</I>

13
00:00:54,460 --> 00:00:56,520
<I>And when they returned home,</I>

14
00:00:56,520 --> 00:01:01,360
<I>their perfect honeymoon</I>   
<I>would continue... Forever.</I>

15
00:01:03,110 --> 00:01:05,440
Mrs. Hodge?

16
00:01:05,720 --> 00:01:08,340
Yes, Mr. Hodge?

17
00:01:08,340 --> 00:01:11,850
Do you have any idea  
how happy we're going to be?

18
00:01:12,950 --> 00:01:16,090
I don't need to be any happier  
than I am already

19
00:01:16,090 --> 00:01:18,530
at this very second.

20
00:01:21,590 --> 00:01:23,720
Oh, my goodness, there's only 15 
minutes before our plane.

21
00:01:23,720 --> 00:01:25,400
If you want that latte,
you should go now.

22
00:01:25,400 --> 00:01:27,030
Yeah, that's a good idea.

23
00:01:27,030 --> 00:01:27,910
<I>... short of heart-wrenching.</I>

24
00:01:27,910 --> 00:01:31,490
<I>The population of homeless</I>   
<I>teenagers continues to climb.</I>

25
00:01:31,490 --> 00:01:32,470
<I>This is Andrew.</I>

26
00:01:32,470 --> 00:01:35,810
<I>Andrew, what is it like</I>   
<I>to live on the streets?</I>

27
00:01:35,810 --> 00:01:37,700
<I>It's not so bad.</I> 
<I>I mean, you know,</I>

28
00:01:37,700 --> 00:01:39,450
<I>sometimes people give you food.</I>

29
00:01:39,450 --> 00:01:41,570
<I>You can find a lot</I>   
<I>in dumpsters.</I>

30
00:01:41,570 --> 00:01:43,450
<I>Uh, I-I mean,</I>   
<I>just last night,</I>

31
00:01:43,450 --> 00:01:46,690
<I>I found almost a whole bucket of chicken</I> 
<I>that had hardly been touched.</I>

32
00:01:46,690 --> 00:01:49,610
<I>Andrew told me</I>   
<I>his heart-wrenching story--</I>

33
00:01:49,610 --> 00:01:51,110
<I>an alcoholic mother,</I>

34
00:01:51,110 --> 00:01:55,740
<I>a ther murdered by the woman's boyfriend</I> 
<I>and a childhood shattered</I>

35
00:01:55,740 --> 00:01:59,800
<I>the day his mother abandoned him</I> 
<I>on the side of the road.</I>

36
00:02:00,920 --> 00:02:02,800
I'll tell you one thing.

37
00:02:02,800 --> 00:02:06,230
Some people just should never  
be allowed to have children.

38
00:02:10,390 --> 00:02:12,650
Darling, I got an extra one 
just in case you...

39
00:02:12,650 --> 00:02:13,670
Bree, what's the matter?

40
00:02:13,670 --> 00:02:17,580
A reporter just did a story on homeless teens,
and my son was one of them.

41
00:02:17,580 --> 00:02:18,760
Oh, my god.

42
00:02:18,760 --> 00:02:22,070
Well, we'll call child welfare 
the minute we get to the resort.

43
00:02:22,070 --> 00:02:24,650
Orson, you can't imagine  
that we're still going!

44
00:02:25,070 --> 00:02:26,560
Well, darling,
the tickets are nonrefundable.

45
00:02:26,560 --> 00:02:28,630
My son is eating out of dumpsters!

46
00:02:28,630 --> 00:02:30,970
Well, yes, but think  
how much better you'll be able to deal

47
00:02:30,970 --> 00:02:33,050
with this crisis after a nice, relaxing--

48
00:02:33,050 --> 00:02:34,290
Orson!

49
00:02:34,290 --> 00:02:35,920
My child is in trouble.

50
00:02:35,920 --> 00:02:39,710
Don't make me choose between the two of you,
because believe me, you will lose.

51
00:02:39,710 --> 00:02:42,960
Now please, get your ass in gear.

52
00:02:47,060 --> 00:02:49,960
<I>It was at this moment</I> 
<I>that Orson realized</I>

53
00:02:49,960 --> 00:02:52,520
<I>their honeymoon was over...</I>

54
00:02:53,040 --> 00:02:55,580
<I>in more ways than one.</I>

55
00:02:56,970 --> 00:03:01,450

56
00:03:04,400 --> 00:03:09,570

57
00:03:12,390 --> 00:03:18,480

58
00:03:38,910 --> 00:03:42,230
<I>It was a holiday weekend</I>   
<I>on Wisteria Lane,</I>

59
00:03:42,810 --> 00:03:45,760
<I>and everyone was packing</I>  
<I>their bags,</I>

60
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:48,790
<I>hoping to get away</I>  
<I>from it all.</I>

61
00:03:49,290 --> 00:03:52,020
-  No, no, all right, good-bye, good-bye! 
- No, no! This is so... unfair.

62
00:03:52,020 --> 00:03:54,850
no, no! what's unfair is  
that we're slowly running out of money,

63
00:03:54,850 --> 00:03:56,710
and you've barely even looked for a job.

64
00:03:56,710 --> 00:03:59,070
you're gonna have a good time, all right? 
I love you. Good-bye!

65
00:03:59,070 --> 00:04:03,260
<I>Lynette was getting away</I> 
<I>from growing tension in her marriage.</I>

66
00:04:03,640 --> 00:04:07,270
You can call it blackmail, Carlos,
but the court calls it "spousal support,"

67
00:04:07,270 --> 00:04:09,670
so unless I get a check by monday,

68
00:04:09,670 --> 00:04:13,560
your shower buddies from jail will 
be throwing you a "welcome back" party.

69
00:04:13,560 --> 00:04:17,390
<I>Gabrielle was getting away</I>
 <I>from an increasingly bitter divorce.</I>

70
00:04:17,390 --> 00:04:18,750
Hi.

71
00:04:19,300 --> 00:04:20,980
I'm ready.

72
00:04:20,980 --> 00:04:24,020
So that's my number, in case there's 
any change in mike's condition.

73
00:04:24,020 --> 00:04:26,140
I'm going to the mountains with a friend.

74
00:04:26,140 --> 00:04:31,210
And, uh, just in case you were wondering,
it's strictly platonic.

75
00:04:31,210 --> 00:04:32,770
He wasn't wondering.

76
00:04:32,770 --> 00:04:36,600
<I>Susan was getting away</I>   
<I>from mounting guilt.</I>

77
00:04:36,940 --> 00:04:39,720
So you can't tell me anything 
about my son's whereabouts?

78
00:04:39,720 --> 00:04:41,270
<I>And then there was Bree,</I>

79
00:04:41,270 --> 00:04:44,240
<I>who had just learned</I>   
<I>there are some problems...</I>

80
00:04:44,240 --> 00:04:46,630
- Fine!   
<I>- You can't run away from.</I>

81
00:04:46,630 --> 00:04:47,780
Some reporter.

82
00:04:47,780 --> 00:04:49,960
All she could tell me was  
what neighborhood they found him in.

83
00:04:49,960 --> 00:04:54,010
They don't have any contact information,
no phone number, no address.

84
00:04:54,010 --> 00:04:57,040
Well, dear, if he had an address,
he wouldn't be homeless.

85
00:04:57,040 --> 00:05:01,020
This really blows. I am this close 
to becoming homecoming queen,

86
00:05:01,020 --> 00:05:05,110
and now I'm gonna be that creepy girl 
whose brother's a pathetic street junkie.

87
00:05:05,110 --> 00:05:07,350
You know, you could ** a little compassion.

88
00:05:07,350 --> 00:05:10,760
Your brother is out there on the 
streets, struggling to survive.

89
00:05:10,760 --> 00:05:12,730
And whose fault is that?

90
00:05:20,940 --> 00:05:23,060
Oh, she's right. This is all my fault.

91
00:05:23,060 --> 00:05:24,580
You can't blame yourself.

92
00:05:24,580 --> 00:05:28,350
No parent can stop a child  
who's determined to run away.

93
00:05:29,610 --> 00:05:32,180
He didn't run away.

94
00:05:33,400 --> 00:05:35,070
I kicked him out.

95
00:05:35,070 --> 00:05:36,530
You what?

96
00:05:36,870 --> 00:05:42,350
I left him on the roadside with 
some money and his clothes.

97
00:05:42,740 --> 00:05:46,370
I didn't tell you because I was afraid  
of what you'd think of me.

98
00:05:48,810 --> 00:05:51,150
You did what you had to do.

99
00:05:52,330 --> 00:05:55,690
I just wish you'd said something sooner.

100
00:05:56,530 --> 00:05:59,430
Don't you know there's nothing  
you can't tell me?

101
00:06:00,810 --> 00:06:04,170
I don't want there to be 
 any secrets between us.

102
00:06:04,170 --> 00:06:06,720
There won't be, not anymore.

103
00:06:09,160 --> 00:06:12,030
You know, Andrew is not the only 
one having a rough year.

104
00:06:12,030 --> 00:06:15,250
I'm the one whose boyfriend got 
shot right in front of her.

105
00:06:18,050 --> 00:06:20,090
We'll talk in the car.

106
00:06:27,390 --> 00:06:29,120
Don't you love this?

107
00:06:29,120 --> 00:06:32,730
Oh, god bless Tom for taking 
the kids camping this weekend.

108
00:06:34,270 --> 00:06:36,340
This is exactly what we needed,

109
00:06:36,340 --> 00:06:38,630
especially after everything  
I've been through lately.

110
00:06:38,630 --> 00:06:41,180
I'm all about relaxing and rejuvenating--

111
00:06:41,180 --> 00:06:42,770
Gaby? yeah?

112
00:06:42,770 --> 00:06:44,770
Could you be all about shutting up?

113
00:06:44,770 --> 00:06:46,680
- Oh, I'm sorry.
- Thanks.

114
00:06:48,060 --> 00:06:50,050
Please don't tell me you brought 
your cell phone.

115
00:06:50,050 --> 00:06:51,100
Oh, I'm sorry.

116
00:06:51,100 --> 00:06:53,500
It's just--I'm waiting for Carlos'  
lawyer to call.

117
00:06:53,500 --> 00:06:56,340
This whole spousal support  
thing's gotten ugly.

118
00:06:56,820 --> 00:06:58,200
Hello?

119
00:06:58,510 --> 00:06:59,970
Oh, hi, Tom!

120
00:06:59,970 --> 00:07:01,230
No! No, no, no. No!

121
00:07:01,230 --> 00:07:04,300
Yeah! Yeah, she's right here. 
Hang on.

122
00:07:04,550 --> 00:07:06,170
Did you say something?

123
00:07:08,640 --> 00:07:09,640
Hey.

124
00:07:09,640 --> 00:07:13,500
Honey, I know it is your weekend away,
but it's my damn back.

125
00:07:14,830 --> 00:07:17,290
I threw it out again. So?

126
00:07:17,290 --> 00:07:21,040
So I can--I can barely sit up.  
The kids are running wild.

127
00:07:21,630 --> 00:07:23,040
I... I need you to come up here.

128
00:07:23,040 --> 00:07:24,800
Well, why don't you 
take a muscle relaxant?

129
00:07:24,800 --> 00:07:28,270
Honey, I've already taken two. 
They're not making a dent.

130
00:07:28,270 --> 00:07:29,960
Well, why don't you give them to the kids?

131
00:07:29,960 --> 00:07:31,240
Ugh, Lynette!

132
00:07:31,240 --> 00:07:33,730
Please don't--  <I>please</I> 
don't do this to me.

133
00:07:33,730 --> 00:07:36,010
Parker, for the last time,

134
00:07:36,010 --> 00:07:38,700
put down the damn ax!

135
00:07:39,720 --> 00:07:41,900
Oh, all right. Yeah, yeah.

136
00:07:41,900 --> 00:07:44,270
I will be there as soon as I can.

137
00:07:46,470 --> 00:07:48,080
God, I hate my life.

138
00:07:48,080 --> 00:07:49,080
I know.

139
00:07:49,080 --> 00:07:51,640
I wouldn't trade with you for anything.

140
00:07:55,320 --> 00:07:58,800
Oh, wow, look at the view.

141
00:07:58,940 --> 00:08:00,710
Oh!

142
00:08:00,710 --> 00:08:03,030
Don't you just love when the 
leaves change color?

143
00:08:03,030 --> 00:08:06,720
Well, that's why I suggested this,
so--so we could hang out for the weekend

144
00:08:06,720 --> 00:08:10,140
and... and enjoy the, um...

145
00:08:11,420 --> 00:08:12,870
*****

146
00:08:12,870 --> 00:08:15,370
Yep, the scenery's great.

147
00:08:16,820 --> 00:08:18,760
So, um...

148
00:08:19,210 --> 00:08:21,390
maybe I should unpack.

149
00:08:21,390 --> 00:08:23,800
Where should I do that?

150
00:08:23,800 --> 00:08:27,000
Well, there are-- there are two bedrooms.

151
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:29,570
One--one is mine...

152
00:08:31,170 --> 00:08:32,870
and there's a guest room.

153
00:08:32,870 --> 00:08:34,760
Oh!

154
00:08:34,760 --> 00:08:36,750
A guest room. That--well, that's handy.

155
00:08:36,750 --> 00:08:38,030
Yeah.

156
00:08:39,720 --> 00:08:43,220
Uh, unless, of course, you--you'd like 
to sleep in my room.

157
00:08:44,930 --> 00:08:47,560
In which case, I would take the guest room.

158
00:08:47,900 --> 00:08:50,640
Oh! I... uh, no, no!

159
00:08:50,640 --> 00:08:54,140
I-I should take the guest room 
because I am the guest.

160
00:08:54,140 --> 00:08:57,480
Yeah, well, it's, uh, it's up the
 stairs at the end of the hall.

161
00:08:57,480 --> 00:08:58,660
Okay.

162
00:09:20,100 --> 00:09:21,770
Susan, I, um...

163
00:09:21,770 --> 00:09:24,610
I think I have <I>your</I> suitcase.

164
00:09:24,610 --> 00:09:27,640
Yeah, and I think I have yours.

165
00:09:29,690 --> 00:09:32,080
So, did you, um,
did you happen to see the, um--

166
00:09:32,080 --> 00:09:33,670
Yeah.

167
00:09:33,670 --> 00:09:36,020
- And did you notice...  
- Hard to miss.

168
00:09:41,150 --> 00:09:43,980
- Well, I'm just going to, um...  
- ...hide pathetically in your room?

169
00:09:44,480 --> 00:09:45,840
Me, too.

170
00:09:53,650 --> 00:09:55,680
Hey, Lynette.

171
00:09:56,420 --> 00:09:57,560
What are you doing here?

172
00:09:57,560 --> 00:09:59,560
Kayla called,
and she told me about Tom's back.

173
00:09:59,560 --> 00:10:00,900
And my car got impounded again,

174
00:10:00,900 --> 00:10:03,240
so I thought that I'd hitch 
a ride with you.

175
00:10:03,240 --> 00:10:04,720
Hitch?

176
00:10:05,910 --> 00:10:08,250
You mean, like, we're gonna be 
driving in the car together?

177
00:10:08,810 --> 00:10:11,390
Well, you could strap me to the front bumper,

178
00:10:11,390 --> 00:10:13,820
but, uh, yeah, I'd be more comfortable inside.

179
00:10:13,820 --> 00:10:16,690
Uh, it's like an 8-hour drive.

180
00:10:16,690 --> 00:10:18,100
So?

181
00:10:19,550 --> 00:10:20,960
Um, how far is the impound lot?

182
00:10:20,960 --> 00:10:24,120
Because, you know, I could just 
drive you over there and--

183
00:10:24,540 --> 00:10:26,500
What's your problem, Lynette?

184
00:10:27,270 --> 00:10:30,440
I don't have a problem. I just 
don't think we both need to go up there.

185
00:10:30,440 --> 00:10:32,370
I can grab Kayla and bring her back.

186
00:10:32,370 --> 00:10:34,040
Oh, I see your plan--

187
00:10:34,040 --> 00:10:36,740
You just wanna go charging up 
there on your white horse

188
00:10:36,740 --> 00:10:39,310
and save everyone, and then I get to be

189
00:10:39,310 --> 00:10:43,470
the rotten mother who didn't give a rat's ass 
and stayed home eating bonbons.

190
00:10:45,130 --> 00:10:46,880
No.

191
00:10:52,450 --> 00:10:55,020
<I>- Due to Lynette's sudden departure...</I> 
- Thank you.

192
00:10:55,020 --> 00:10:59,890
<I>Gabrielle was forced</I> 
<I>to spend the last night of her spa vacation alone,</I>

193
00:10:59,890 --> 00:11:02,230
<I>but she didn't mind.</I>

194
00:11:03,980 --> 00:11:08,540
<I>In fact, she looked forward</I> 
<I>to a quiet dinner alone with her thoughts.</I>

195
00:11:09,700 --> 00:11:11,640
<I>unfortunately for Gabrielle,</I>

196
00:11:11,640 --> 00:11:15,130
<I>her thoughts quickly turned</I>  
<I>to her impending divorce</I>

197
00:11:15,130 --> 00:11:18,170
<I>and the empty house</I>  
<I>she'd soon return to,</I>

198
00:11:19,940 --> 00:11:24,030
<I>and she began to resent</I>  
<I>the happy couples she was seeing...</I>

199
00:11:24,620 --> 00:11:26,500
<I>everywhere.</I>

200
00:11:27,660 --> 00:11:30,290
What is this, freakin' Noah's Ark?!

201
00:11:32,240 --> 00:11:34,650
I guess it really <I>is</I> a small world.

202
00:11:34,650 --> 00:11:36,750
Who's there? I can't see you.

203
00:11:38,600 --> 00:11:40,680
Can you see me now?

204
00:11:50,400 --> 00:11:52,080
How much, baby?

205
00:11:53,900 --> 00:11:55,680
Excuse me, Ma'am?

206
00:11:57,540 --> 00:11:59,430
I mean... Miss,

207
00:11:59,430 --> 00:12:01,880
I'm looking for someone. 
Uh, his name is Andrew.

208
00:12:01,880 --> 00:12:03,080
Have you seen him?

209
00:12:03,080 --> 00:12:05,910
Hard to say, boo. 
I see a lot of lost boys his age.

210
00:12:05,910 --> 00:12:08,880
Good-looking one, though. 
Someone special?

211
00:12:08,880 --> 00:12:11,500
Yes, very, and I'm worried sick about im.

212
00:12:11,500 --> 00:12:14,290
You might try the soup kitchen 
at st. malachi's on third.

213
00:12:14,290 --> 00:12:17,720
- Oh, thank you, miss...  
- Gates. Pearly Gates--

214
00:12:17,720 --> 00:12:20,650
'Cause you can't get to heaven 
without going through me.

215
00:12:21,940 --> 00:12:24,050
How very saucy.

216
00:12:31,190 --> 00:12:32,990
Great pIano. Do you play?

217
00:12:32,990 --> 00:12:34,890
Oh, no, I'm a-- I'm a bit rusty.

218
00:12:34,890 --> 00:12:38,050
Jane loved to sing, so I'd play for her,
but since the accident...

219
00:12:38,050 --> 00:12:39,620
Right.

220
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:47,460
So...

221
00:12:48,950 --> 00:12:50,440
Brandy,

222
00:12:50,440 --> 00:12:52,220
a roaring fire--

223
00:12:52,220 --> 00:12:54,130
what could be more romantic?

224
00:12:54,130 --> 00:12:56,690
Well, I can think of-- of something.

225
00:12:59,470 --> 00:13:01,090
Wow, my heart is pounding.

226
00:13:01,090 --> 00:13:03,620
Uh, is that a bad thing? 
Consider the alternative.

227
00:13:04,920 --> 00:13:07,240
Your heart is beating 
even faster than mine.

228
00:13:07,240 --> 00:13:10,400
I guess I'm excited. 
It has been a while.

229
00:13:10,850 --> 00:13:12,570
Me, too.

230
00:13:22,030 --> 00:13:24,310
So was that, uh, okay?

231
00:13:24,310 --> 00:13:26,700
It was bloody fantastic.

232
00:13:27,270 --> 00:13:30,060
Of course, it's a bit different 
than what I'm used to.

233
00:13:30,260 --> 00:13:31,270
Different?

234
00:13:31,270 --> 00:13:34,540
Well, I-I was with the same 
woman for a long time.

235
00:13:34,540 --> 00:13:36,210
Oh, yeah.

236
00:13:36,210 --> 00:13:38,710
But, I mean, you kissed other
 girls before that, right?

237
00:13:38,710 --> 00:13:41,470
Sure, but most of them were 12.

238
00:13:41,810 --> 00:13:43,040
As was I.

239
00:13:43,040 --> 00:13:47,630
I met one at a school dance,
and after we started dating,

240
00:13:47,630 --> 00:13:49,930
well, I--well, I never looked at anyone else.

241
00:13:49,930 --> 00:13:52,720
Are you saying that Jane is 
the only woman you ever...

242
00:13:52,720 --> 00:13:54,920
Oh, God, I <I>so</I> didn't want to tell you that.

243
00:13:54,920 --> 00:13:57,320
Why not? I think that's adorable.

244
00:13:57,320 --> 00:14:02,190
Well, I don't want to be adorable. 
I want to be dashing and worldly and...

245
00:14:02,190 --> 00:14:04,830
Oh, Ian. It's okay.

246
00:14:04,830 --> 00:14:09,220
Some people have a lot of lovers,
and some just a few.

247
00:14:09,220 --> 00:14:10,950
It doesn't matter.

248
00:14:11,980 --> 00:14:16,960
Well, see--seeing as it doesn't matter,
where--where do you fall on that spectrum?

249
00:14:18,250 --> 00:14:20,920
You know, how--how many men have you been with?

250
00:14:20,920 --> 00:14:23,420
- Ian.  
- Oh, I'm sorry. That--that was rude.

251
00:14:23,420 --> 00:14:25,100
I withdraw the question.

252
00:14:25,100 --> 00:14:27,440
It's not that it's rude. 
It's just immaterial.

253
00:14:27,440 --> 00:14:30,270
I mean, it's just a number. 
It doesn't mean anything.

254
00:14:30,270 --> 00:14:32,620
- Seeing as it doesn't mean anything--  
- Ian!

255
00:14:32,620 --> 00:14:34,600
Well, you know my number. It's only fair.

256
00:14:34,600 --> 00:14:37,330
Is it-- is it more than three?

257
00:14:37,730 --> 00:14:39,600
Nine.

258
00:14:39,600 --> 00:14:41,900
Please tell me you were answering in german.

259
00:14:41,900 --> 00:14:45,800
Nine lovers is not a lot! 
Nine lovers does not make me a slut!

260
00:14:45,800 --> 00:14:46,990
Why are you getting upset?

261
00:14:46,990 --> 00:14:50,330
Because it was really 11, and I knocked
 off two, and you're still judging me.

262
00:14:50,330 --> 00:14:53,690
I'm not judging you. It's just... 
did you work in the recording industry?

263
00:14:53,690 --> 00:14:54,990
Okay, just so you know,

264
00:14:54,990 --> 00:14:57,530
11 is not a lot for a woman my age.

265
00:14:57,530 --> 00:14:58,920
How old are you?

266
00:14:58,920 --> 00:15:01,100
What is this, the Gallup poll?!

267
00:15:01,100 --> 00:15:04,190
- Where--where are you going?  
- To bed, <I>alone.</I>

268
00:15:04,190 --> 00:15:07,910
You know, it's something that I've always wanted 
to try, but I've just never gotten around to.

269
00:15:10,570 --> 00:15:12,960
So they liked the landscaping 
I did here so much

270
00:15:12,960 --> 00:15:17,410
that they hired my company 
to do whole sinclair hotel chain.

271
00:15:17,810 --> 00:15:20,760
Your company? You have a company now?

272
00:15:20,760 --> 00:15:24,050
Oh, my gosh, when I met you,
all you had was a bike.

273
00:15:24,050 --> 00:15:25,080
Well, not only that,

274
00:15:25,080 --> 00:15:28,110
the, uh, Gardening Channel's approached 
me about hosting my own show.

275
00:15:28,110 --> 00:15:31,410
I mean, we're still 
in the talking stages, but...

276
00:15:32,440 --> 00:15:33,850
What?

277
00:15:33,850 --> 00:15:35,440
Nothing. I just...

278
00:15:35,440 --> 00:15:38,730
I can't get over how mature 
and confident you are.

279
00:15:38,730 --> 00:15:40,750
You've really changed.

280
00:15:40,750 --> 00:15:44,450
Thanks. I was hoping you'd notice.

281
00:15:44,450 --> 00:15:47,760
So I guess, uh, there's no chance 
of getting you over to the house

282
00:15:47,760 --> 00:15:50,010
to pick the dead leaves off my ficus.

283
00:15:50,910 --> 00:15:54,010
Yeah, you know, I'm--I'm kind of past that.

284
00:15:54,010 --> 00:15:58,890
Besides, I don't think 
Mr. Solis would approve.

285
00:15:58,890 --> 00:16:01,530
Actually, we're getting a divorce.

286
00:16:04,120 --> 00:16:06,910
Um, I'm--I'm really sorry to hear that.

287
00:16:06,910 --> 00:16:09,490
Really? Then why are you smiling?

288
00:16:09,490 --> 00:16:11,510
I don't know. Why are you?

289
00:16:13,120 --> 00:16:14,830
Gabrielle...

290
00:16:16,310 --> 00:16:18,620
It's really great to see you.

291
00:16:18,620 --> 00:16:20,880
Gabrielle.

292
00:16:20,880 --> 00:16:24,280
I think that's the first time 
you've ever called me that.

293
00:16:26,390 --> 00:16:28,030
Well, um...

294
00:16:28,420 --> 00:16:30,470
I hope you enjoy the rest of your stay.

295
00:16:32,130 --> 00:16:34,240
I intend to.

296
00:16:50,890 --> 00:16:52,510
Your cuppy thing is full.

297
00:16:52,510 --> 00:16:54,870
Do you mind if I put this 
in your glove compartment?

298
00:16:54,870 --> 00:16:57,060
Yeah, I do mind. I mind deeply.

299
00:16:57,060 --> 00:17:00,000
Jeez-a-marooni. 
I'll just get rid of 'em.

300
00:17:04,480 --> 00:17:07,210
Oh, that's...  delightful. 
That's delightful.

301
00:17:07,210 --> 00:17:10,270
Maybe it'll just soak up 
the cream soda you spilled.

302
00:17:10,900 --> 00:17:13,240
Why do you  <I>always</I> pick on me?

303
00:17:13,630 --> 00:17:16,170
It's like your new favorite game is
 "finding fault with Nora."

304
00:17:16,170 --> 00:17:18,340
No, my favorite game

305
00:17:18,340 --> 00:17:22,540
is counting all the things 
I'm <I>dying</I> to say to you,

306
00:17:22,540 --> 00:17:23,650
but I don't.

307
00:17:23,650 --> 00:17:24,840
Like...

308
00:17:24,840 --> 00:17:27,490
"Pipe down, you annoying nut job."

309
00:17:27,490 --> 00:17:29,570
I'd never say that.

310
00:17:29,940 --> 00:17:31,000
You think I'm crazy.

311
00:17:31,000 --> 00:17:32,960
No!

312
00:17:32,960 --> 00:17:35,340
You're colorful--

313
00:17:35,340 --> 00:17:39,640
colorful in a way that might 
respond to medication.

314
00:17:39,640 --> 00:17:41,410
Well, you know...

315
00:17:41,410 --> 00:17:44,080
there's levels of crazy, Lynette.

316
00:17:44,080 --> 00:17:48,400
I mean, there are people like me 
who just have a big personality.

317
00:17:48,400 --> 00:17:50,850
Then there are the kind of people 
who do things like this.

318
00:17:51,650 --> 00:17:55,430
- Aah! Oh, my God! Knock it off! 
- What is the matter with you?!

319
00:17:55,430 --> 00:17:58,180
What is wrong with you? 
What the hell do you think you're doing?

320
00:17:58,180 --> 00:18:01,570
Oh, lighten up. 
Come on, it was a joke.

321
00:18:01,570 --> 00:18:03,960
No, well, it wasn't funny. 
If you wanna kill yourself, fine,

322
00:18:03,960 --> 00:18:07,430
- but don't take me with you.  
- Ooh, you'd like that, wouldn't ya?

323
00:18:07,430 --> 00:18:10,520
You'd really like that,
if I killed myself.

324
00:18:10,520 --> 00:18:14,410
That is not what I'm saying.

325
00:18:14,410 --> 00:18:18,180
But if you did,
I'd find a way to carry on.

326
00:18:23,910 --> 00:18:25,300
Pull over.

327
00:18:25,300 --> 00:18:28,110
- Oh, lighten up. It's a joke. 
- Pull the car over.

328
00:18:28,110 --> 00:18:30,490
- Nah.  
- Pull it over!

329
00:18:30,490 --> 00:18:33,010
- Pull over, or I will jump out of this car.  
- All right, all right, all right, all right.

330
00:18:33,010 --> 00:18:37,110
I'm pulling over! Jeez! 
What the hell are you doing?!

331
00:18:37,110 --> 00:18:39,720
Hitching my way...

332
00:18:39,720 --> 00:18:41,440
to the campsite!

333
00:18:42,630 --> 00:18:43,720
Nora!

334
00:18:43,720 --> 00:18:45,670
You can't be serious!

335
00:18:45,670 --> 00:18:47,540
Shut up! Just get out of my face!

336
00:18:47,540 --> 00:18:49,720
I'm not talking to you!

337
00:18:51,740 --> 00:18:54,170
All right, now look, you've gone
 from crazy to stupid.

338
00:18:54,170 --> 00:18:55,710
This guy could be dangerous.

339
00:18:55,710 --> 00:18:58,710
Well, then, it's your lucky day,
huh, Lynette?

340
00:18:59,520 --> 00:19:01,230
Shut up!

341
00:19:01,230 --> 00:19:02,180
See?

342
00:19:02,180 --> 00:19:05,320
This is what you do. 
You just manipulate.

343
00:19:05,320 --> 00:19:08,590
You wormed your way into my family.

344
00:19:08,590 --> 00:19:11,650
You conned your way into coming 
on this trip with me,

345
00:19:11,650 --> 00:19:14,860
and now you wanna force me into saving you.

346
00:19:14,860 --> 00:19:18,780
Well, forget it! You wanna go, <I>go.</I>

347
00:19:41,220 --> 00:19:44,680
No, I've tried that. 
It wasn't enough power.

348
00:19:45,120 --> 00:19:47,070
Yeah, I'm way ahead of you.

349
00:19:47,070 --> 00:19:48,360
All right, here it goes.

350
00:19:51,190 --> 00:19:53,370
Ah, it worked! I'm a genius.

351
00:20:01,220 --> 00:20:03,630
Oh, hi. Um, I'm looking for Edie.

352
00:20:03,630 --> 00:20:04,850
She's out.

353
00:20:05,220 --> 00:20:08,460
- Ugh, God, where is everyone tonight? 
- Anything I can do?

354
00:20:08,460 --> 00:20:11,320
No, not unless you can fix a fuse box.

355
00:20:11,320 --> 00:20:13,400
My science fair project blew the power out.

356
00:20:13,400 --> 00:20:15,150
Oh, what's your project?

357
00:20:15,150 --> 00:20:17,610
Oh, uh, it's complicated.

358
00:20:17,610 --> 00:20:20,620
You think I'm too dumb to 
understand your little science project?

359
00:20:20,620 --> 00:20:23,300
It's not little. 
I finished third in the state twice.

360
00:20:23,300 --> 00:20:25,450
Now can you fix the fuse box or not?

361
00:20:25,950 --> 00:20:29,270
Most houses built after 1990 are 
wired through a circuit breaker.

362
00:20:29,270 --> 00:20:31,930
You didn't blow a fuse. You tripped a breaker.

363
00:20:31,930 --> 00:20:35,590
Not to challenge a 2-time state science fair 
almost-champion or anything.

364
00:20:38,090 --> 00:20:39,840
Let me grab a flashlight.

365
00:20:39,840 --> 00:20:42,930
Maybe you could also grab a shirt... 
and some pants.

366
00:20:43,270 --> 00:20:45,450
Pants would be nice.

367
00:20:47,340 --> 00:20:49,520
Susan, can I come in?

368
00:20:49,520 --> 00:20:52,550
I'm with a client. Take a number.

369
00:20:53,280 --> 00:20:55,300
Susan, please.

370
00:20:58,060 --> 00:20:59,310
Everything I said

371
00:20:59,310 --> 00:21:01,840
came out of my-- 
my own insecurity and fear

372
00:21:01,840 --> 00:21:05,290
that I--that I might... 
well, I might disappoint you.

373
00:21:06,570 --> 00:21:08,470
I was gonna stay mad
 at you another hour,

374
00:21:08,470 --> 00:21:11,580
but your damn accent gets me every time.

375
00:21:11,580 --> 00:21:13,660
Blimey, you--you don't say?

376
00:21:13,660 --> 00:21:16,000
Don't push it.

377
00:21:38,560 --> 00:21:41,740
Oh, no, I-I don't mean to break the flow,
but I-I just, um...

378
00:21:42,410 --> 00:21:45,860
Look, I know that I'm only 
your second lover ever,

379
00:21:45,860 --> 00:21:48,010
and that--I-I know that means a lot,

380
00:21:48,010 --> 00:21:51,270
and I just don't want it 
to mean.. too much.

381
00:21:51,270 --> 00:21:53,490
I'm not following you. 
What do you want it to mean?

382
00:21:53,490 --> 00:21:56,810
I mean, the last time you did this,
it turned into a lifetime commitment,

383
00:21:56,810 --> 00:21:58,690
and I--I'm just-- I'm not ready for that.

384
00:21:58,690 --> 00:22:00,510
You think I am?

385
00:22:00,510 --> 00:22:04,840
Well, I assure you, I'm as capable 
of having meaningless sex as you are.

386
00:22:06,080 --> 00:22:08,860
I have never had meaningless sex.

387
00:22:08,860 --> 00:22:10,740
So you were--you were passionately in love

388
00:22:10,740 --> 00:22:13,850
and deeply committed to all 11 
of your conquests?

389
00:22:13,850 --> 00:22:17,640
Don't judge me, Mr. Virgin... plus one!

390
00:22:17,640 --> 00:22:20,120
Okay, okay, we--we seem to have gotten 
off on the wrong foot again.

391
00:22:20,120 --> 00:22:22,390
Susan...

392
00:22:22,770 --> 00:22:26,560
Cheerio? Bob's your uncle?

393
00:22:26,560 --> 00:22:29,300
Get out.

394
00:22:30,070 --> 00:22:31,640
- Can't we at least talk?  
- Why?

395
00:22:31,640 --> 00:22:33,440
You know, every time we do,
we just get angry.

396
00:22:33,440 --> 00:22:35,020
Well, we're still getting 
to know each other,

397
00:22:35,020 --> 00:22:38,080
and that's good. You--you've learned 
I'm a tad insecure,

398
00:22:38,080 --> 00:22:40,640
And I've learn--well, you're just 
a wee bit touchy.

399
00:22:40,640 --> 00:22:43,130
Okay, Ian, you know what? 
This is-- this is not happening.

400
00:22:43,130 --> 00:22:44,370
I am just **ing ep**,

401
00:22:44,370 --> 00:22:47,140
and you can just drive me home 
in the morning.

402
00:22:56,340 --> 00:22:59,620
Uh, excuse me. I'm looking for my son.
Have you seen him?

403
00:23:01,140 --> 00:23:02,830
Have you seen him?

404
00:23:03,620 --> 00:23:07,360
Excuse me, young man. 
Have you seen this boy?

405
00:23:09,420 --> 00:23:12,140
Andrew! Oh, my God, thank god!

406
00:23:12,140 --> 00:23:13,410
What are you doing here?

407
00:23:13,410 --> 00:23:15,690
Looking for you. 
How did you get that bruise?

408
00:23:15,690 --> 00:23:18,310
- It's none of your business. 
- Andrew, please!

409
00:23:18,310 --> 00:23:21,280
Shouldn't you be at home,
taking care of your new husband?

410
00:23:21,280 --> 00:23:22,510
How did you find out that--

411
00:23:22,510 --> 00:23:25,370
I read it in the paper-- you know,
the one I sleep under.

412
00:23:25,370 --> 00:23:28,100
Andrew, you have every right 
to be angry with me,

413
00:23:28,100 --> 00:23:29,820
but if you knew how sorry I am--

414
00:23:29,820 --> 00:23:32,920
if you came here sucking after forgiveness,
you came to the wrong place.

415
00:23:32,920 --> 00:23:35,180
Andrew, please,
can't we just talk about this?

416
00:23:35,180 --> 00:23:37,390
I'm your mother, for God's sakes! 
You're my son.

417
00:23:37,390 --> 00:23:40,750
No, <I>you</I> dumped your son 
at a gas station seven months ago.

418
00:23:40,750 --> 00:23:43,000
I'm somebody else now.

419
00:23:43,000 --> 00:23:44,750
Andrew.

420
00:23:47,360 --> 00:23:48,810
Andrew!

421
00:23:48,810 --> 00:23:51,470
Andrew, please!

422
00:23:53,340 --> 00:23:55,720
Andrew!

423
00:24:10,760 --> 00:24:12,510
What happened to your ride?

424
00:24:13,790 --> 00:24:15,270
The guy grabbed my boob,

425
00:24:15,270 --> 00:24:18,520
so I hit him over the head 
with his bong, and I got out.

426
00:24:22,770 --> 00:24:24,650
Look, I'm sorry I freaked out there before.

427
00:24:24,650 --> 00:24:29,150
It's just, when you made that crack about suicide,
it just... kind of hit home.

428
00:24:29,700 --> 00:24:32,570
Oh, my god, Nora.

429
00:24:32,570 --> 00:24:35,040
Did you actually...

430
00:24:36,360 --> 00:24:40,360
Well, I'm... I'm very sorry. I had no idea.

431
00:24:44,690 --> 00:24:47,160
But your life is better now, right?

432
00:24:47,160 --> 00:24:51,530
You have a beautiful daughter,
and you have that fun job at the...

433
00:24:51,530 --> 00:24:53,980
pancake house.

434
00:24:53,980 --> 00:24:56,020
Oh, yeah, my life's better.

435
00:24:56,020 --> 00:24:57,160
Yeah.

436
00:24:57,160 --> 00:25:01,340
But it's not <I>your</I> life. 
Your life's <I>perfect.</I>

437
00:25:01,340 --> 00:25:06,200
Excuse me? Did you smoke that bong 
before you beat the guy with it?

438
00:25:06,200 --> 00:25:09,750
It's just, you have it all. 
You have the kids. You have the career.

439
00:25:09,750 --> 00:25:12,390
You have a husband.

440
00:25:12,390 --> 00:25:13,690
You're Supermom.

441
00:25:13,690 --> 00:25:16,200
And you think that's easy? 
Okay, I have a good life.

442
00:25:16,200 --> 00:25:20,500
Yes, yes, I am <I>very</I> lucky,
but I work 12 hours a day,

443
00:25:20,500 --> 00:25:22,770
and then I come home 
to what seems like 33 children

444
00:25:22,770 --> 00:25:25,430
and husban who resents to get a job.

445
00:25:25,430 --> 00:25:29,740
And believe me, there is not a Supermom 
out there who wouldn't trade in her cape

446
00:25:29,740 --> 00:25:32,070
for a chance to read a book 
and get a massage

447
00:25:32,070 --> 00:25:34,520
by a man who has the decency 
to leave when it's over.

448
00:25:34,520 --> 00:25:37,920
Okay, sorry I brought it up.

449
00:25:41,030 --> 00:25:44,530
I'm sorry I said that about Tom. 
He's doing his best to find a job.

450
00:25:44,530 --> 00:25:48,340
Well, you know, maybe he'd try a little harder 
if he didn't hate advertising so much.

451
00:25:48,340 --> 00:25:50,780
He doesn't hate advertising.

452
00:25:50,780 --> 00:25:53,200
Last week, when he came 
to pick up Kayla,

453
00:25:53,200 --> 00:25:56,160
and he'd just come 
from some crappy interview,

454
00:25:56,160 --> 00:26:01,060
he said that he'd hated the ad game for,
like, freakin' ever

455
00:26:01,060 --> 00:26:03,310
and would like to bag the whole thing.

456
00:26:03,310 --> 00:26:05,630
He said that to you?

457
00:26:07,720 --> 00:26:09,370
He's never told me that.

458
00:26:09,370 --> 00:26:11,810
He's probably afraid to.

459
00:26:12,200 --> 00:26:14,350
Why would he be afraid?

460
00:26:14,350 --> 00:26:16,050
Probably because you're the kind 
of woman who,

461
00:26:16,050 --> 00:26:19,140
when someone says they wanna kill themselves,

462
00:26:19,140 --> 00:26:21,300
you say, "go ahead."

463
00:26:27,110 --> 00:26:30,860
- You sure you don't want to come in? 
- No, I'm good.

464
00:26:33,250 --> 00:26:35,240
Uh, you really should see what I'm doing,

465
00:26:35,240 --> 00:26:37,630
you know, for next time.

466
00:26:42,040 --> 00:26:45,030
Okay, here's the tripped switch.

467
00:26:45,030 --> 00:26:50,550
So first, you move it to "off"...  
to reset, then you press it... to "on."

468
00:26:51,890 --> 00:26:54,280
- That's it?  
- Yeah.

469
00:26:54,280 --> 00:26:56,840
You didn't have to come all the 
way over here to do that.

470
00:26:56,840 --> 00:26:58,930
You could've just explained it to me.

471
00:26:58,930 --> 00:27:01,430
Yeah, I guess I could've.

472
00:27:02,140 --> 00:27:04,180
Well... hello there.

473
00:27:04,180 --> 00:27:05,910
Edie! Hi.

474
00:27:05,910 --> 00:27:06,940
Oh, sorry.

475
00:27:06,940 --> 00:27:09,300
Uh, he was just-- he was helping
 me get the lights back on.

476
00:27:09,300 --> 00:27:11,620
I-I overloaded my circuits.

477
00:27:11,620 --> 00:27:13,600
I can see that.

478
00:27:13,940 --> 00:27:16,060
Yeah, so she's doing 
some big science project,

479
00:27:16,060 --> 00:27:19,080
and she needed <I>me</I> 
to explain how electricity works.

480
00:27:19,080 --> 00:27:21,310
I think that's called "irony."

481
00:27:21,310 --> 00:27:23,400
Julie, where's your mom?

482
00:27:23,400 --> 00:27:25,550
She's on a trip. 
Do you need something?

483
00:27:25,550 --> 00:27:30,030
Yeah, back when I could stand her,
I loaned her my cd player. I need it.

484
00:27:30,030 --> 00:27:32,390
Oh, she took it to the hospital for mike.

485
00:27:32,390 --> 00:27:33,900
Oh, God.

486
00:27:33,900 --> 00:27:37,890
This Florence Nightingale 
act is really chapping my ass.

487
00:27:38,290 --> 00:27:41,510
Hey, science guy,
I have an experiment for you.

488
00:27:41,510 --> 00:27:42,930
Go home,

489
00:27:42,930 --> 00:27:46,660
mix ounces of gin,
a splash of vermouth,

490
00:27:46,660 --> 00:27:49,840
and see if it improves 
my mood when I drink it.

491
00:27:52,650 --> 00:27:56,590
Julie, sweetie... 
you're a good girl.

492
00:27:56,590 --> 00:27:59,060
Do yourself a favor 
and stay away from my nephew.

493
00:27:59,060 --> 00:28:04,440
Oh! Trust me, I have no interest 
in swaggering, muscle-bound juvenile delinquents.

494
00:28:04,820 --> 00:28:06,180
Honey...

495
00:28:06,180 --> 00:28:07,820
that's what every good girl says

496
00:28:07,820 --> 00:28:10,300
just before she becomes a bad girl.

497
00:28:10,770 --> 00:28:13,980
Trust me, I know.

498
00:28:18,800 --> 00:28:20,650
Except now when we're done,

499
00:28:20,650 --> 00:28:23,230
I don't have to proofread 
your essay on "Ethan Frome."

500
00:28:23,230 --> 00:28:26,060
And I don't have to jump out 
of a window. That's a nice change.

501
00:28:26,060 --> 00:28:27,140
- Yeah.

502
00:28:27,140 --> 00:28:30,230
Hey, how about I order 
up a bottle of Dom?

503
00:28:30,230 --> 00:28:32,190
Ooh, I like Rich John!

504
00:28:37,800 --> 00:28:41,840
Hello? Oh! Uh, hi.

505
00:28:42,260 --> 00:28:45,820
Nothing, uh, you know, just, uh,
room service and a movie.

506
00:28:45,820 --> 00:28:47,470
What?

507
00:28:48,300 --> 00:28:50,890
Really? You're--you're kidding.

508
00:28:50,890 --> 00:28:53,300
Uh, no! I'm--I'm thrilled.

509
00:28:53,740 --> 00:28:56,430
It's, uh, room 424.

510
00:28:56,930 --> 00:28:59,390
Me, too. Bye.

511
00:28:59,390 --> 00:29:01,200
- You gotta get out of here.  
- What?

512
00:29:01,200 --> 00:29:02,710
My fiancée's on her way up. Oh!

513
00:29:02,710 --> 00:29:04,920
- Your fiancée?  
- She was supposed to come tomorrow.

514
00:29:04,920 --> 00:29:07,470
Guess she decided to surprise me. 
Get dressed!

515
00:29:08,040 --> 00:29:10,360
Uh, you-- you're <I>engaged?</I> 
To who?!

516
00:29:10,360 --> 00:29:13,240
Her name's Tammy. 
Where's your other shoe?!

517
00:29:13,240 --> 00:29:14,710
How could you do this to me?

518
00:29:14,710 --> 00:29:16,880
I would never have let you seduce me 
if I knew you were getting married.

519
00:29:16,930 --> 00:29:18,900
Well, you didn't have any problem sleeping 
with me when <I>you</I> were married!

520
00:29:18,900 --> 00:29:21,990
You knew about Carlos! 
My cheating was upfront and honest.

521
00:29:21,990 --> 00:29:25,410
Look, Gaby, we don't have time 
for this. Get moving.

522
00:29:25,410 --> 00:29:28,810
No, I'm not going anywhere. In fact,
I wanna meet the blushing bride.

523
00:29:28,810 --> 00:29:30,040
Listen to me, okay?

524
00:29:30,040 --> 00:29:33,030
Her name is Tammy Sinclair,
as in Sinclair Hotels,

525
00:29:33,030 --> 00:29:35,170
as in her father owns 
this whole damn chain.

526
00:29:35,170 --> 00:29:38,760
So if she catches you in here,
I am totally screwed.

527
00:29:44,430 --> 00:29:46,720
Poodle!

528
00:29:48,670 --> 00:29:51,250
Look at you, surprising me.

529
00:29:51,250 --> 00:29:53,560
- Oh, I missed you. 
- I missed you, too.

530
00:29:55,180 --> 00:29:57,720
Ugh, this room blows.

531
00:29:57,720 --> 00:29:59,450
Daddy was supposed to hook us up 
with a suite.

532
00:29:59,450 --> 00:30:01,440
You know, you're right.

533
00:30:01,440 --> 00:30:03,300
Why don't we go down 
to the front desk and demand one?

534
00:30:03,300 --> 00:30:05,530
- Come on.  
- Oh, no. They're all booked.

535
00:30:10,120 --> 00:30:11,890
They call this a closet?

536
00:30:11,890 --> 00:30:14,130
Where am I supposed to put all my stuff?

537
00:30:14,130 --> 00:30:18,020
You know, I could really use a drink. 
Why don't we go down to the bar?

538
00:30:18,020 --> 00:30:22,140
I'm wiped. I just wanna stay in.

539
00:30:22,830 --> 00:30:25,350
Didn't you unpack yet?

540
00:30:25,720 --> 00:30:29,310
No, um, actually,
the--the zipper is stuck,

541
00:30:29,310 --> 00:30:33,240
um, but they have a guy 
at the hotel that can fix it.

542
00:30:33,240 --> 00:30:36,270
You know I should-- I should probably 
go ahead and take it down to the lobby.

543
00:30:36,270 --> 00:30:37,700
Now?

544
00:30:38,430 --> 00:30:40,460
I'm horny.

545
00:30:40,460 --> 00:30:42,180
So am I...

546
00:30:43,540 --> 00:30:47,040
but I will be a lot hornier...

547
00:30:47,040 --> 00:30:49,840
once I get rid of this suitcase.

548
00:30:54,330 --> 00:30:56,060
Poodle?

549
00:30:56,060 --> 00:30:58,370
Where did this diamond watch come from?

550
00:30:58,840 --> 00:31:00,750
Oh, shoot, um...

551
00:31:02,260 --> 00:31:04,900
That's what you get 
for surprising me.

552
00:31:05,290 --> 00:31:07,700
I didn't get a chance to wrap it.

553
00:31:08,950 --> 00:31:11,390
You like it?

554
00:31:11,390 --> 00:31:14,190
I love it!

555
00:31:14,190 --> 00:31:18,230
- I'm never taking it off!  
- Son of a bitch!

556
00:31:18,980 --> 00:31:20,980
Come here, you!

557
00:31:28,650 --> 00:31:29,950
John?

558
00:31:39,540 --> 00:31:43,090
John, where are you, damn it?

559
00:31:58,350 --> 00:32:01,530
Don't laugh. 
I saved a bundle on airfare.

560
00:32:27,660 --> 00:32:29,560
Susan, I'm so--

561
00:32:57,830 --> 00:33:00,150
Your azaleas are breathtaking.

562
00:33:00,150 --> 00:33:01,870
Thank you. Ahem.

563
00:33:02,690 --> 00:33:04,810
You should be very proud of them.

564
00:33:05,140 --> 00:33:08,500
Yeah, it's nice to know 
that I can raise some things correctly.

565
00:33:09,290 --> 00:33:12,440
Darlin', be patient.

566
00:33:12,950 --> 00:33:15,090
Andrew will come around.

567
00:33:15,090 --> 00:33:18,220
No, I don't think he will.

568
00:33:18,720 --> 00:33:20,370
I failed him.

569
00:33:20,370 --> 00:33:21,790
I think you're being 
too hard on yourself.

570
00:33:21,790 --> 00:33:24,030
And you're not being hard enough.

571
00:33:24,030 --> 00:33:26,690
Stop saying that 
what I did was understandable.

572
00:33:26,690 --> 00:33:28,720
I'm a mother who abandoned her child.

573
00:33:28,720 --> 00:33:30,940
That's... unnatural.

574
00:33:30,940 --> 00:33:34,100
Bree, it's hot. You're tired. 
Why don't you come inside?

575
00:33:34,100 --> 00:33:37,560
Because there is a bottle of Chardonnay 
in the refrigerator, and right now

576
00:33:37,560 --> 00:33:41,100
this little chore is the only thing 
that's keeping me from going inside

577
00:33:41,100 --> 00:33:43,160
and drinking the whole damn thing.

578
00:33:46,880 --> 00:33:48,820
Well...

579
00:33:49,990 --> 00:33:52,830
the azaleas really are lovely.

580
00:34:00,260 --> 00:34:03,290
Yes, they are, aren't they?

581
00:34:18,230 --> 00:34:20,050
Hi.

582
00:34:21,110 --> 00:34:24,280
Look, I'm sorry.

583
00:34:27,900 --> 00:34:29,990
Here's your watch.

584
00:34:30,920 --> 00:34:33,130
I guess I'll just buy Tammy a new one.

585
00:34:33,130 --> 00:34:36,850
Don't you mean her daddy will buy her 
a new one and just launder the money through you?

586
00:34:36,850 --> 00:34:38,680
I don't blame you for being angry.

587
00:34:38,680 --> 00:34:41,130
All right, I should've  
told you the truth from the start.

588
00:34:41,130 --> 00:34:44,990
But when I saw you there 
in the moonlight,

589
00:34:44,990 --> 00:34:47,830
it took me right back 
to when we were together.

590
00:34:49,560 --> 00:34:51,210
Me, too.

591
00:34:52,940 --> 00:34:54,900
Do you wanna sit down?

592
00:34:58,490 --> 00:35:01,180
You know, you're pretty hard 
to stay mad at.

593
00:35:02,150 --> 00:35:03,190
Good,

594
00:35:03,190 --> 00:35:05,930
'cause I really didn't want 
this to end badly.

595
00:35:05,930 --> 00:35:08,250
Who says it has to end?

596
00:35:09,900 --> 00:35:11,380
What are you talking about?

597
00:35:11,380 --> 00:35:14,220
Well, I'm single now,
and I thought we could maybe...

598
00:35:14,220 --> 00:35:17,730
Gaby... I'm getting married.

599
00:35:18,240 --> 00:35:21,160
Sure, and I was married 
when we got together.

600
00:35:21,160 --> 00:35:23,580
Right, but <I>that</I>

601
00:35:23,580 --> 00:35:25,380
is not how I'm gonna be married.

602
00:35:25,380 --> 00:35:29,190
Well, that's what I thought,
but trust me, marriage is hard.

603
00:35:29,190 --> 00:35:31,990
I know that, but...

604
00:35:31,990 --> 00:35:33,710
I love Tammy,

605
00:35:33,710 --> 00:35:36,070
and I don't wanna screw it up.

606
00:35:36,070 --> 00:35:38,590
'Cause enough of those screwups and...

607
00:35:38,590 --> 00:35:41,420
you just end up alone.

608
00:35:43,870 --> 00:35:46,670
Yeah, that can happen.

609
00:35:57,020 --> 00:35:59,150
Good-bye, Gabrielle.

610
00:36:12,760 --> 00:36:14,150
Um, hey, mister, uh,

611
00:36:14,150 --> 00:36:17,320
could you spare a buck or 2? 
I'm--I'm really hungry.

612
00:36:21,260 --> 00:36:22,930
Hey, thanks!

613
00:36:22,930 --> 00:36:25,840
I'll give you $50 more,
if you let me buy you lunch.

614
00:36:26,540 --> 00:36:29,550
Fries and a large root beer.

615
00:36:32,550 --> 00:36:34,600
What am I gonna have 
to do to earn this?

616
00:36:34,600 --> 00:36:36,460
I told you, I just wanna talk to you.

617
00:36:36,460 --> 00:36:39,060
- You another reporter? 
- No.

618
00:36:39,060 --> 00:36:43,350
You a youth pastor? 
You trying to save my soul?

619
00:36:43,350 --> 00:36:45,230
Oh, you make it sound like a challenge.

620
00:36:45,230 --> 00:36:47,860
No, I just wanna understand you, Andrew.

621
00:36:49,030 --> 00:36:51,500
Wait, how did you know my name?

622
00:36:54,820 --> 00:36:57,480
You're him, aren't you? 
You're, uh...

623
00:36:57,480 --> 00:36:59,450
The new husband.

624
00:36:59,450 --> 00:37:01,440
Orson.

625
00:37:02,230 --> 00:37:05,510
You know, I wouldn't talk to her.
What makes her think I'll listen to you?

626
00:37:06,230 --> 00:37:08,210
Your mother doesn't know I'm here.

627
00:37:09,430 --> 00:37:11,240
All right, <I>Dad.</I>

628
00:37:11,240 --> 00:37:13,390
What do you wanna talk about,
<I>Dad?</I>

629
00:37:13,390 --> 00:37:16,080
I wanna know how you survive out here. 
What do you do for money?

630
00:37:18,160 --> 00:37:21,110
I ask. People give it to me.

631
00:37:22,380 --> 00:37:24,180
That's it?

632
00:37:25,330 --> 00:37:27,120
What--what do you wanna know?

633
00:37:27,120 --> 00:37:30,730
Have--have I done stuff for money 
that I'm not proud of?

634
00:37:32,330 --> 00:37:37,470
Yeah, sure, but you figured that out 
as soon I asked you what the $50 was for.

635
00:37:37,470 --> 00:37:39,060
But, uh...

636
00:37:39,060 --> 00:37:40,930
Don't--don't tell my mom.

637
00:37:40,930 --> 00:37:44,910
Or--or you know what? 
Do. Who cares?

638
00:37:44,910 --> 00:37:48,140
Well, I think part of you wants me to tell her 
because you know how much it would hurt her.

639
00:37:48,640 --> 00:37:52,190
I mean, that's why you're out here,
isn't it? To punish her.

640
00:37:52,580 --> 00:37:55,740
When will you have punished her enough,
Andrew?

641
00:37:55,740 --> 00:37:57,410
When you turn to drugs to numb the pain,

642
00:37:57,410 --> 00:38:00,500
or you catch a disease  
you'll never be rid of?

643
00:38:00,500 --> 00:38:02,910
Don't pretend to care  
about me, all right?

644
00:38:02,910 --> 00:38:06,540
I do care about you,
because Bree cares about you,

645
00:38:06,820 --> 00:38:09,270
because we're more alike  
than you think.

646
00:38:10,270 --> 00:38:12,170
I know about rage.

647
00:38:12,590 --> 00:38:16,330
I know how it eats you up. 
But rage goes away,

648
00:38:16,330 --> 00:38:18,350
and when it does,

649
00:38:18,800 --> 00:38:21,680
you're just left 
with the mess you've made.

650
00:38:23,220 --> 00:38:25,090
Thanks for lunch.

651
00:38:25,680 --> 00:38:29,140
You change your mind,
you know where to find us.

652
00:38:43,900 --> 00:38:45,360
How's your back?

653
00:38:45,360 --> 00:38:47,720
If I don't breathe, great.

654
00:38:47,720 --> 00:38:51,070
God, it has been so long  
since my back has acted up.

655
00:38:51,070 --> 00:38:54,570
Then wham, out of the blue,
I'm crying by a tree stump.

656
00:38:54,570 --> 00:38:56,630
Well, you're under a lot of stress.

657
00:38:56,630 --> 00:38:59,640
You got a new kid in the family. 
You're job hunting.

658
00:38:59,640 --> 00:39:02,880
Ugh. Are we gonna fight about 
that again? 'Cause if so,

659
00:39:02,880 --> 00:39:05,030
I'm gonna need those last four  
muscle relaxants.

660
00:39:05,030 --> 00:39:09,630
No, I don't wanna fight. 
In fact, I was thinking...

661
00:39:10,310 --> 00:39:13,190
if you can't find something  
you like in advertising,

662
00:39:13,190 --> 00:39:16,110
maybe you should cast a wider net.

663
00:39:16,110 --> 00:39:17,890
Meaning what?

664
00:39:18,520 --> 00:39:22,110
You're a bright guy. Isn't there anything 
else you might wanna do?

665
00:39:24,730 --> 00:39:26,740
I'd like to play bass for Aerosmith.

666
00:39:26,740 --> 00:39:28,710
Okay, let's call that the backup plan.

667
00:39:28,710 --> 00:39:32,280
But, seriously, don't you have  
some road not taken,

668
00:39:32,280 --> 00:39:36,070
some dream you never got around to?

669
00:39:37,580 --> 00:39:39,830
I don't know.
Maybe.

670
00:39:40,430 --> 00:39:41,960
Maybe?

671
00:39:41,960 --> 00:39:45,000
I don't know. You get married.  
You have kids and...

672
00:39:47,460 --> 00:39:49,490
you lose track of that stuff.

673
00:39:49,490 --> 00:39:51,470
Well, think about it, okay?

674
00:39:51,470 --> 00:39:55,790
Cause whatever you wanna do,
I'm in your corner.

675
00:39:57,440 --> 00:40:00,250
Man, did I luck out marrying you.

676
00:40:00,250 --> 00:40:02,760
Tell me something I don't know.

677
00:40:13,030 --> 00:40:14,960
Hi, Mike.

678
00:40:15,470 --> 00:40:17,290
It's Edie.

679
00:40:19,040 --> 00:40:21,910
I'm sorry that I haven't 
come by to visit.

680
00:40:26,050 --> 00:40:28,060
Pretty rough luck, huh?

681
00:40:31,070 --> 00:40:33,400
Anyway, I'm, um...

682
00:40:33,400 --> 00:40:36,140
here to pick up my cd player.

683
00:40:36,140 --> 00:40:38,410
So...

684
00:40:44,210 --> 00:40:47,840
Well, I hope you feel better soon.

685
00:41:02,750 --> 00:41:04,560
Damn!

686
00:41:05,420 --> 00:41:07,360
And that's <I>with</I> the coma.

687
00:41:23,600 --> 00:41:27,030
<I>We all carry something with us.</I>

688
00:41:27,850 --> 00:41:31,360
<I>Of course, it's nice</I>   
<I>if we travel with someone</I>

689
00:41:31,360 --> 00:41:34,000
<I>who can help lighten the load.</I>

690
00:41:37,160 --> 00:41:41,580
<I>But usually it's easier</I> 
<I>to just drop what we've been carrying</I>

691
00:41:41,580 --> 00:41:46,290
<I>so we can get home</I>   
<I>that much sooner...</I>

692
00:41:49,600 --> 00:41:51,130
<I>assuming, of course,</I>

693
00:41:51,130 --> 00:41:55,180
<I>there will be someone there</I>   
<I>to greet us when we arrive.</I>

694
00:41:58,560 --> 00:42:00,920
<I>Why do we clutch</I>   
<I>at this baggage</I>

695
00:42:00,920 --> 00:42:04,200
<I>even when we're desperate</I>   
<I>to move on?</I>

696
00:42:06,910 --> 00:42:10,930
<I>Because we all know</I>   
<I>there's a chance</I>

697
00:42:10,930 --> 00:42:14,600
<I>we might let go too soon.</I>

698
00:42:14,600 --> 00:42:16,250
