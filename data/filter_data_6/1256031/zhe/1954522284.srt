1
00:00:14,470 --> 00:00:16,400
Problem?
怎么了?

2
00:00:16,410 --> 00:00:19,030
- This is Thai food.
- Here we go.
- 这是泰国菜
- 又来了

3
00:00:20,200 --> 00:00:23,070
We don't have Thai food on
Thursday. We have pizza on Thursday.
周四不该吃泰国菜 应该吃披萨

4
00:00:23,080 --> 00:00:27,980
Yes, but we all agreed that the third Thursday of
every month would be Anything Can Happen Thursday.
是啊 但我们一致同意
每月第三个周四是随心所欲日

5
00:00:28,010 --> 00:00:30,440
Well, apparently the news
didn't reach my digestive system,
显然没通知我的消化系统

6
00:00:30,480 --> 00:00:34,390
which, when startled, has it's own
version of Anything Can Happen Thursday.
它一震惊 就开始自己随心所欲了

7
00:00:35,910 --> 00:00:38,380
Come on, the whole idea behind
Anything Can Happen Thursday
拜托 随心所欲日的目的

8
00:00:38,390 --> 00:00:40,760
is to get out of this
rut we've been in lately.
就是要打破常规

9
00:00:40,790 --> 00:00:43,570
Rut? I think you mean "consistency."
常规? 你是说"连续性"吧

10
00:00:43,580 --> 00:00:46,490
And if we're going to abandon that,
then why even call it Thursday?
如果想要抛弃常规 干啥还叫周四呢?

11
00:00:46,520 --> 00:00:51,170
Let's call it "Quonko Day" and divide
it into 29 hours of 17 minutes apiece,
何不改成"Quonko日" 每天29小时17分

12
00:00:51,220 --> 00:00:54,970
and celebrate it by sacrificing
a goat to the mighty god Ra.
杀头山羊向上神献祭来庆祝

13
00:00:56,910 --> 00:00:59,330
I could go for some goat.
我能弄到山羊

14
00:01:00,890 --> 00:01:04,510
Sheldon, wagreed we'd do
something different tonight.
Sheldon 说好今晚做点别的

15
00:01:04,520 --> 00:01:07,320
All right. Let's go to
the comic book store.
好啊 一起去漫画书店吧

16
00:01:07,330 --> 00:01:08,880
We went to the comic
book store last night.
昨晚刚去过啊

17
00:01:08,900 --> 00:01:10,370
Last night was Wednesday.
昨晚是周三

18
00:01:10,400 --> 00:01:11,700
Wednesday is comic book night.
周三是漫画之夜

19
00:01:11,740 --> 00:01:16,890
Tonight, we'll be going on Thursday,
because it's Anything Can Happen Thursday.
今晚算是周四去 因为今天是随心所欲日

20
00:01:17,890 --> 00:01:21,720
Way to think outside but pressed
right up against the box, Sheldon.
思维跳跃 打破常规啊 Sheldon

21
00:01:22,010 --> 00:01:23,950
So what are we going to do tonight?
今晚到底要做什么呢?

22
00:01:23,960 --> 00:01:28,660
If I may proffer a suggestion, in bars
all across this great nation of ours,
容我建议 你看全国各地酒吧里

23
00:01:28,690 --> 00:01:31,460
Thursday night is Ladies' Night.
周四是美女之夜

24
00:01:31,470 --> 00:01:33,260
Which means, as the evening progresses,
也就是说 随着黑夜越深

25
00:01:33,300 --> 00:01:38,160
we will get better looking courtesy of 99
cent margaritas and two-for-one Jell-O shots.
拿着99美分的龙舌兰和买一送一的果冻饮
我们能更有魅力

26
00:01:40,710 --> 00:01:44,820
Come on, Howard, the odds of us picking
up girls in a bar are practically zero.
拜托 Howard 咱们泡到美女的几率为零

27
00:01:44,840 --> 00:01:47,260
Oh, really? Are you familiar
with the Drake Equation?
真的吗 你知道德瑞克方程吗?

28
00:01:47,270 --> 00:01:49,870
The one that estimates the odds of
making contact with extraterrestrials
那个通过计算一系列严格限制的小数乘积

29
00:01:49,890 --> 00:01:52,950
by calculating the product of an increasingly
restrictive series of fractional values
例如有行星的星系和可能产生生命的行星

30
00:01:52,960 --> 00:01:55,760
such as those stars with planets, and
those planets likely to develop life?
得出接触外星生物几率的方程式?

31
00:01:55,790 --> 00:02:00,400
N equals R times FP times NE
times FL times FI times FC times L?
N=R*FP*NE*FL*FI*FC*L?

32
00:02:03,870 --> 00:02:06,280
Yeah, that one.
就这个

33
00:02:10,790 --> 00:02:14,310
You can modify it to calculate
our chances of having sex
可以修改一下 用来计算我们艳遇的几率

34
00:02:14,330 --> 00:02:17,330
by changing the formula to use the
number of single women in Los Angeles,
只需改用洛杉矶单身女性数量

35
00:02:17,360 --> 00:02:22,870
the number of those who might find us attractive,
and what I call the Wolowitz Coefficient.
会对我们一见钟情的人的数量
还有Wolowitz系数

36
00:02:23,660 --> 00:02:25,250
The Wolowitz Coefficient?
Wolowitz系数?

37
00:02:25,270 --> 00:02:28,720
Neediness times dress size squared.
需求度乘以衣服紧身度的平方

38
00:02:29,620 --> 00:02:33,710
Crunching the numbers, I come up with a
conservative 5,812 potential sex partners
通过计算 40英里之内 保守估计

39
00:02:33,720 --> 00:02:35,960
within a 40-mile radius.
有5812个潜在对象

40
00:02:35,980 --> 00:02:38,010
You're joking.

00:02:38,020 --> 00:02:41,000
I'm a horny engineer, Leonard.
我是饥渴的工程师 Leonard

42
00:02:41,010 --> 00:02:43,800
I never joke about math or sex.

43
00:02:45,290 --> 00:02:48,930
Well, what are we waiting
for? Let's bounce, bitches.

We're going to hit it and quit it.

00:03:05,290 --> 00:03:08,730
Or we could finish eating and
go to the comic book store.

49
00:03:09,160 --> 00:03:11,070
Also a good plan.

Thursday, we're definitely going to a bar.

To the comic book store.

comic book store? On a Thursday?

humor featuring talking babies

a new suit for him without knowing his size.

Why don't you just come with us?

145

I'd feel like an idiot.

146
00:08:26,950 --> 00:08:28,190
I don't believe it.
难以置信

up in Penny's siness over there?

Nobody's up in anybody's business.

All right.
那好

167
00:09:37,400 --> 00:09:40,890
Then is it fair to say that you're
experiencing some sort of emotional turmoil
那说你因为今晚早些时候Penny那事

168
00:09:40,930 --> 00:09:43,990
over the events involving
Penny earlier this evening?

asking strangers on the Internet.

00:10:40,070 --> 00:10:42,750

207
00:11:49,330 --> 00:11:51,350

208
00:11:53,200 --> 00:11:56,260
Let me just go inside
and slip off my underwear.

209
00:11:59,210 --> 00:12:00,370
Why?

210
00:12:00,410 --> 00:12:04,700

to be caught in my Aquaman briefs.
要是走运的话 我可不想被她

Do you... Let's go.

212
00:12:14,130 --> 00:12:17,160
May I have a grasshopper with
a little umbrella, please?
来一杯绿色蚱蜢 要撑把小伞的

213
00:12:17,900 --> 00:12:20,080
- No, he may not.
- Why?
- 不 他不要了

00:12:20,090 --> 00:12:24,710
I'm not sitting here with a guy drinking
a grasshopper with a little umbrella.
我才不要跟喝撑把小伞的

Fine. I'll have a chocolate martini.
行 那我要巧克力马提尼

216
00:12:29,850 --> 00:12:31,720
Wrong again!
又错了!

217
00:12:31,760 --> 00:12:36,410
Come on, you know I can't talk to women unless
I'm lit up like the Hindu festival of Devali.
算了吧 你知道我只有像过排灯节那样
被点得金亮亮才能和女人说话啊

218
00:12:40,700 --> 00:12:44,960
Look, there are plenty of bars in Los Angeles where
you can order grasshoppers and chocolate martinis,
听着 整个洛杉矶有无数酒吧
你尽可以点绿色蚱蜢或者巧克力马提尼

219
00:12:44,990 --> 00:12:48,890
but you wouldn't have to because
there are no women in them.
但那根本没必要
因为里头压根没有女人

220
00:12:49,830 --> 00:12:52,340
Gotcha.
了解

221
00:12:52,350 --> 00:12:55,310
I'll have a Brandy Alexander.
那给我来一杯白兰地亚历山大

222
00:12:55,740 --> 00:12:59,190
All right, the Three Musketeers
just became the Dynamic Duo.
好吧 三个火枪手变成了活力双雄
(来自<蝙蝠侠与罗宾>)

223
00:12:59,800 --> 00:13:02,140
- Should we talk to some of these women?
- No.
- 我们应该找这些女人聊聊吗?
- 不

224
00:13:02,150 --> 00:13:04,430
It's way too early
in the night for that.
这对于今晚来说还太早了点

225
00:13:04,460 --> 00:13:08,500
See, first we let the lawyers and
the jocks thin the herd, and then...
这样 我们先让那些律师 运动员什么的
缩小猎物范围 然后...

226
00:13:08,550 --> 00:13:11,470
we go after the weak
and the old and the lame.
我们就去追他们挑剩下的老弱病残

227
00:13:12,930 --> 00:13:14,320
That's your system?
这就是你的泡妞方式?

228
00:13:14,350 --> 00:13:16,830
That's my system.
对 这是我的独门秘方

229
00:13:17,450 --> 00:13:21,160
Oh, and if you spot a chick with
a Seeing Eye dog, she's mine.
噢对了 如果你看到一个牵着
导盲犬的少妇 她是我的

230
00:13:24,390 --> 00:13:25,530
Oh, come on.
噢 拜托

231
00:13:25,550 --> 00:13:29,570
I think it's nice that Captain
Sweatpants showed up to your art opening.
我觉得"运动裤船长"出现在
你的艺术展上挺好呀

232
00:13:30,830 --> 00:13:34,370
Yeah, it would have been nicer if
he hadn't touched all the cheese.
对 如果他不把奶酪摸个遍就更好了

233
00:13:36,840 --> 00:13:38,660
You know, it's kind of early.
嗯 现在时间还有点早

234
00:13:38,700 --> 00:13:40,990
Do you want to maybe come in
for some coffee or something?
你想进来喝杯咖啡什么的吗?

235
00:13:41,020 --> 00:13:44,500
Oh, gee, it's a little
late for coffee, isn't it?
现在喝咖啡好像有点晚了 不是吗

236
00:13:45,110 --> 00:13:49,270
Oh, you think "coffee," means
coffee. That is so sweet.
噢 你觉得"咖啡"就是指咖啡
真是个小可爱

237
00:13:50,220 --> 00:13:52,310
Come on. I think I have decaf.
来吧 我有不含咖啡因的"咖啡"

238
00:13:52,320 --> 00:13:55,100
Oh, good. Stuart. I
thought I heard your voice.
噢 太好了 Stuart
我觉得刚才是听到你说话来着

239
00:13:55,110 --> 00:13:56,460
Do you have a moment?
你现在有时间吗?

240
00:13:56,490 --> 00:13:57,750
Uh, yeah, I guess.
呃 有 我想

241
00:13:57,770 --> 00:13:59,620
Sheldon, we're a little busy here, so...
Sheldon 我们现在有点忙 所以...

242
00:13:59,650 --> 00:14:01,830
- What are you doing?
- We're having coffee.
- 你们要干什么?
- 我们要喝点咖啡

243
00:14:02,370 --> 00:14:05,030
Well, isn't it a little late for coffee?
不觉得现在喝咖啡有点晚么?

244
00:14:05,490 --> 00:14:07,940
It's okay. She thinks she has decaf.
没关系 她说她有无咖啡因的

245
00:14:12,430 --> 00:14:14,870
I'll just go look for it.
我现在进去找找看

246
00:14:14,880 --> 00:14:15,870
What's up?
什么事?

247
00:14:15,920 --> 00:14:20,250
Well, I've spent the last three hours in an
online debate in the DC Comics Batman chatroom,
我刚才花了三个小时在DC漫画
蝙蝠侠聊天室网上辩论

248
00:14:20,260 --> 00:14:23,890
- and I need your help.
- Oh, yeah. Those guys can be very stubborn.
- 我需要你帮忙
- 噢 我了解 那帮家伙有时非常顽固

249
00:14:23,900 --> 00:14:24,830
What's the topic?
你们辩论的主题是?

250
00:14:24,850 --> 00:14:27,960
I am asserting, in the event that
Batman's death proves permanent,
我坚持认为 当蝙蝠侠长眠于世之后

251
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:32,460
the original Robin, Dick Grayson, is
the logical successor to the Bat Cowl.
逻辑上讲 第一代罗宾 Dick Grayson
应该是蝙蝠侠战衣的继承者

252
00:14:32,470 --> 00:14:36,240
Sheldon, I'm afraid you
couldn't be more wrong.
Sheldon 恐怕你不能错的更厉害了

253
00:14:40,610 --> 00:14:43,570
More wrong?
错的更厉害?

254
00:14:44,680 --> 00:14:49,050
Wrong is an absolute state
and not subject to gradation.
错误是一个绝对的状态
你不能对它进行程度上的划分

255
00:14:49,570 --> 00:14:52,720
Of course it is. It'a little wrong
to say a tomato is a vegetable.
当然可以 说番茄是一种蔬菜
就是有一点点错误

256
00:14:52,730 --> 00:14:56,270
It's very wrong to say
it's a suspension bridge.
如果说它是一座吊桥
那就是严重的错误

257
00:14:57,440 --> 00:15:01,010
But returning to the original
issue, Dick Grayson became Nightwing,
回到刚才的事情上
Dick Grayson后来成了夜翔

258
00:15:01,020 --> 00:15:02,520
a superhero in his own right.
自立门户的英雄

259
00:15:02,560 --> 00:15:05,560
Batman 2 has to be the
second Robin, Jason Todd.
于是蝙蝠侠2里就出现了
第二代罗宾 Jason Todd

260
00:15:05,570 --> 00:15:07,860
Has to be? Has to be?
一定要这样吗? 一定要吗?

261
00:15:08,960 --> 00:15:12,090
I hope you're being
deliberately provocative.
我希望你只是在故意煽动和挑拨

262
00:15:12,800 --> 00:15:14,130
I found the decaf!
我找到脱咖啡因咖啡了!

263
00:15:14,160 --> 00:15:14,740
Oh, great!
噢 太棒了!

264
00:15:14,750 --> 00:15:17,640
Herbal tea for me, please.
给我来杯花草茶 谢谢

265
00:15:20,580 --> 00:15:23,860
Barkeep! Alexander me.
老板! 来杯亚历山大

266
00:15:24,920 --> 00:15:26,730
How about those two?
那两个怎么样?

267
00:15:26,760 --> 00:15:28,640
No... They're eating peanuts.
不... 他们在吃花生

268
00:15:28,650 --> 00:15:32,670
And my allergies, one kiss would
put me in Cedars-Sinai for a week.
我的花生过敏症 一个吻就足够送我到
Cedars-Sinai医疗中心呆上一个礼拜

269
00:15:34,930 --> 00:15:37,530
What about the ones in the corner?
角落里那些如何?

270
00:15:37,540 --> 00:15:40,460
Possible. Very possible.
还不错 非常不错

271
00:15:40,470 --> 00:15:43,790
Do you want the one in the whiplash
collar or the one who keeps blinking?
你想要那个戴着颈椎围脖的还是那个
不停眨眼睛的?

272
00:15:44,810 --> 00:15:48,000
- I think Blinky's cute.
- You got it, sir.
- 我觉得眨眼睛那个挺可爱的
- 好吧 先生

273
00:15:48,010 --> 00:15:50,280
Wait, so we just go over there?
