background checks here.

Oh, you'll be our waitress.

00:00:07,843 --> 00:00:09,643

this to me when I had money?

00:01:07,269 --> 00:01:09,135
Only if you had an attitude.

25
00:01:09,137 --> 00:01:12,038

Actually, it's an old thing.

146
00:06:28,181 --> 00:06:30,951
In fact, it's kind
of a family tradition.

147
00:06:30,951 --> 00:06:34,721

148

162

not only to find out
what you are as a business

163
00:07:14,391 --> 00:07:17,391

167
00:07:23,401 --> 00:07:24,931
and saying that a brand is simply a name

168
00:07:24,931 --> 00:07:29,071
is like saying

00:07:52,761 --> 00:07:54,931
but I do what I can."

179
00:07:54,931 --> 00:07:57,201
and they shrug. Now, is
that the right attitude?

180
00:07:57,201 --> 00:08:00,131
- (all) No.
- Yes.

181
00:08:00,131 --> 00:08:03,941
To those people, I say,
"don't do what you can.

182
00:08:03,941 --> 00:08:05,341
Can what you do."

183
00:08:05,341 --> 00:08:07,541
Don't do what you can.

184
00:08:07,541 --> 00:08:09,341
Can what you do! Get it?

185
00:08:09,341 --> 00:08:10,381
Do you get it?

186
00:08:10,381 --> 00:08:12,881
- (all) Yes.
- No.

187
00:08:12,881 --> 00:08:15,051
- You did not get it.
- Shh.

188
00:08:15,051 --> 00:08:16,851
All right, everybody,
reach under your chairs

189
00:08:16,851 --> 00:08:18,151
and pick up what you find there.

190
00:08:18,151 --> 00:08:20,921
Hope it's a way out of here.

191
00:08:22,961 --> 00:08:24,321
Koosh balls?

192
00:08:24,321 --> 00:08:27,231
Inside those cans, you will find the key

193
00:08:27,231 --> 00:08:28,931
to success in your business.

194
00:08:28,931 --> 00:08:31,261
Not unless the key is
Rosie O'Donnell's career

195
00:08:31,271 --> 00:08:34,301
before her buzz cut.

196
00:08:34,301 --> 00:08:35,971
Truth.

197
00:08:35,971 --> 00:08:37,841
That's the big secret to business.

198
00:08:37,841 --> 00:08:39,971
If people buy what you're saying,

199
00:08:39,971 --> 00:08:42,171
they will buy what you're selling.

200
00:08:42,181 --> 00:08:45,481
Max, stay alert. This
could go to cult like that.

201
00:08:45,481 --> 00:08:47,481
I like to think of those
things you're holding

202
00:08:47,481 --> 00:08:51,481
as my truth balls.

203
00:08:55,291 --> 00:08:59,261
Screw this. Let's get to the meatballs.

204
00:08:59,261 --> 00:09:00,931
Anytime in the next two days,

205
00:09:00,931 --> 00:09:02,661
one of you is up here
selling you something

206
00:09:02,661 --> 00:09:05,001
that you feel is just bull,

207
00:09:05,001 --> 00:09:06,831
Then toss it...

208
00:09:06,831 --> 00:09:07,871
Max!

209
00:09:07,871 --> 00:09:10,801
I mean, Ellen!

210
00:09:10,801 --> 00:09:14,071
Yeah, baby.

211
00:09:14,071 --> 00:09:16,811
That is what I'm talking about.

212
00:09:16,811 --> 00:09:18,211
Whoever threw that is not afraid

213
00:09:18,211 --> 00:09:19,181
to really go for it,

214
00:09:19,181 --> 00:09:20,811
and that will go a long way

215
00:09:20,811 --> 00:09:22,651
toward success in business.

216
00:09:22,651 --> 00:09:24,881
All right, cool, but is it
a long way to the buffet?

217
00:09:24,881 --> 00:09:27,191
'Cause I am starving.

218
00:09:29,121 --> 00:09:30,691
Okay, everyone.

219
00:09:30,691 --> 00:09:32,621
Consider these small
groups you've broken into

220
00:09:32,631 --> 00:09:34,331
as little think tanks.

221
00:09:34,331 --> 00:09:37,501
I need you to work together
and bring out your very best.

222
00:09:37,501 --> 00:09:38,701
[snores]

223
00:09:38,701 --> 00:09:40,431
Max!

224
00:09:40,431 --> 00:09:41,801
Don't blame me.

225
00:09:41,801 --> 00:09:44,041
Blame the heavy cream
at the fettuccini bar.

226
00:09:44,041 --> 00:09:48,311
Alfredo must be Italian for "roofie."

227
00:09:48,311 --> 00:09:50,511
So, Ellen, tell us what you have,

228
00:09:50,511 --> 00:09:53,441
and I'll tell you what we think.

229
00:09:53,451 --> 00:09:54,911
Oh, Ellen. That's you.

230
00:09:54,911 --> 00:09:56,911
Oh, oh, yes, yes, that's me.

231
00:09:56,921 --> 00:09:58,851
I'm Ellen. Definitely an Ellen.

232
00:09:58,851 --> 00:10:00,891
See, I dance.

233
00:10:04,661 --> 00:10:06,091
Okay.

234
00:10:07,791 --> 00:10:11,731
Okay. Okay, now it's weird.

235
00:10:11,731 --> 00:10:13,901
So, Ellen...

236
00:10:15,471 --> 00:10:17,331
Let's hear your B.B.B....

237
00:10:17,341 --> 00:10:20,371
Your brilliant business brand.

238
00:10:20,371 --> 00:10:21,411
Uh...

239
00:10:21,411 --> 00:10:22,411
[chuckles]

240
00:10:22,411 --> 00:10:24,041
[stammers]

241
00:10:24,041 --> 00:10:26,381
I-I don't do the talking.
Pamela does the talking.

242
00:10:26,381 --> 00:10:27,751
- Pam?
- Thanks, Ellen.

243
00:10:27,751 --> 00:10:32,351
Hello, everyone, my name is Pam Panning,

244
00:10:32,351 --> 00:10:34,821
and what my partner,
Ellen, was trying to say is,

245
00:10:34,821 --> 00:10:37,751
we making very beautiful
artisan cupcakes.

246
00:10:37,761 --> 00:10:39,761
Yeah, but they're still cool.

247
00:10:39,761 --> 00:10:41,561
I never said they weren't cool.

248
00:10:41,561 --> 00:10:43,631
Yeah, mm, maybe they
just didn't sound cool

249
00:10:43,631 --> 00:10:47,061
coming out of your face.

250
00:10:47,071 --> 00:10:48,771
I'm sorry, but at least actual words

251
00:10:48,771 --> 00:10:51,301
are better than, "uh, uh-uh, uh..."

252
00:10:51,301 --> 00:10:53,341
Ladies, hold.

253
00:10:53,341 --> 00:10:54,971
Sometimes in business

254
00:10:54,971 --> 00:10:59,111
partners' ships will sail
in two different directions,

255
00:10:59,111 --> 00:11:01,111
so you two need to find
out if you're gonna continue

256
00:11:01,111 --> 00:11:04,251
to sail apart or if
you're gonna change course

257
00:11:04,251 --> 00:11:08,251
and reconvene at the port
of mutual understanding.

258
00:11:08,251 --> 00:11:10,651
Well, we can't sail too far apart

259
00:11:10,661 --> 00:11:12,421
'cause I'm definitely
gonna have to explain

260
00:11:12,421 --> 00:11:15,591
what you just said to her.

261
00:11:15,591 --> 00:11:17,331
I got it.

262
00:11:17,331 --> 00:11:20,461
I'm a boat, and I'm trying
to get away from you.

263
00:11:20,471 --> 00:11:23,471
Sounds right to me.

264
00:11:23,471 --> 00:11:24,831
Think it over.

265
00:11:24,841 --> 00:11:27,001
Talk it over with your first mate.

266
00:11:27,011 --> 00:11:29,741
[snickers]

267
00:11:29,741 --> 00:11:31,011
Come back tomorrow

268
00:11:31,011 --> 00:11:33,241
and tell me who your business is,

269
00:11:33,251 --> 00:11:35,041
and I'll help guide
you toward that purpose.

270
00:11:35,051 --> 00:11:37,611
And remember, you
can't purpose without...

271
00:11:37,621 --> 00:11:40,351
- Puss.
- Okay, wow.

272
00:11:40,351 --> 00:11:43,491
Gordon, her boat's kind of
in shallow water right now,

273
00:11:43,491 --> 00:11:45,261
but we're gonna go
away, get it together,

274
00:11:45,261 --> 00:11:47,221
and come back and blow you away.

275
00:11:47,231 --> 00:11:49,391
And you can't spell
"blow you away" without...

276
00:11:49,391 --> 00:11:50,861
Our ship's leaving.

277
00:11:54,671 --> 00:11:55,901
Oh, hello.

278
00:11:55,901 --> 00:11:57,801
Welcome to the Williamsburg Diner.

279
00:11:57,801 --> 00:12:03,141
Can I get you anything,
like a work ethic?

280
00:12:03,141 --> 00:12:05,941
Han, this is adorable, but we're busy.

281
00:12:05,941 --> 00:12:07,641
We're pitching our
business brand tomorrow,

282
00:12:07,651 --> 00:12:09,511
and Max and I need to
get on the same page.

283
00:12:09,511 --> 00:12:10,751
Yeah, we don't want to work here

284
00:12:10,751 --> 00:12:12,451
the rest of our lives.

285
00:12:12,451 --> 00:12:15,751
Well, now we're all on the same page.

286
00:12:15,751 --> 00:12:17,221
Han, just give us ten minutes.

287
00:12:17,221 --> 00:12:18,451
Then we'll get to work.

288
00:12:18,461 --> 00:12:19,721
Well, I've waited four years.

289
00:12:19,721 --> 00:12:21,321
What's another ten minutes?

290
00:12:22,761 --> 00:12:24,731
Max, I have to say I was a little thrown

291
00:12:24,731 --> 00:12:26,401
by that thing you said today.

292
00:12:26,401 --> 00:12:28,231
What, that the best sex I've ever had

293
00:12:28,231 --> 00:12:31,031
was alone on the Tilt-A-Whirl?

294
00:12:31,041 --> 00:12:34,201
No, why would that throw me?
You say that every day.

295
00:12:34,211 --> 00:12:36,911
No, that thing about
me not sounding cool.

296
00:12:36,911 --> 00:12:40,111
Why would that throw
you? I say it every day.

297
00:12:40,111 --> 00:12:42,681
Yes, but not about the business.

298
00:12:42,681 --> 00:12:44,911
So what was it? The word "artisan"?

299
00:12:44,921 --> 00:12:50,521
Okay, first of all, it
sounds like fart-isan,

300
00:12:50,521 --> 00:12:54,221
as in, "a fart is in
this room right now."

301
00:12:54,231 --> 00:12:58,191
Somebody finally called
you out on it, Caroline.

302
00:13:00,431 --> 00:13:02,501
So I was thinking our slogan could be,

303
00:13:02,501 --> 00:13:05,931
"Max's Homemade Cupcakes.
Sugar and spice."

304
00:13:05,941 --> 00:13:08,541
I'd rather go with Fart-isan.

305
00:13:08,541 --> 00:13:09,911
Really, Beavis?

306
00:13:09,911 --> 00:13:13,041
What does your business
partner Butthead think?

307
00:13:13,041 --> 00:13:14,481
Our business isn't working.

308
00:13:14,481 --> 00:13:16,381
Well, guess who is working.

309
00:13:16,381 --> 00:13:18,251
Me, the damn owner.

310
00:13:20,581 --> 00:13:21,881
Why are you surprised?

311
00:13:21,891 --> 00:13:23,951
You know how many
cupcakes were not selling.

312
00:13:23,951 --> 00:13:26,291
I mean, you're secretly
eating at least six a night

313
00:13:26,291 --> 00:13:28,161
to make me think we're selling more.

314
00:13:28,161 --> 00:13:31,861
Also 'cause I'm sad.

315
00:13:31,861 --> 00:13:35,001
Look, I know you went
to Wharton and all, but...

316
00:13:35,001 --> 00:13:36,731
Wait...

317
00:13:36,731 --> 00:13:38,471
What's happening?

318
00:13:38,471 --> 00:13:42,241
Is this a business intervention on me?

319
00:13:42,241 --> 00:13:43,811
From someone who pronounces

320
00:13:43,811 --> 00:13:47,811
the word business "bidness"?

321
00:13:47,811 --> 00:13:49,811
Why are you giving me
the big eye-painting face?

322
00:13:49,811 --> 00:13:51,411
You knew the business wasn't working.

323
00:13:51,421 --> 00:13:53,751
Well, I don't hear you
coming up with any ideas.

324
00:13:53,751 --> 00:13:55,151
That's 'cause you don't listen.

325
00:13:55,151 --> 00:13:56,851
Remember when I said
we should stop making

326
00:13:56,851 --> 00:13:58,051
all these flowery cupcakes

327
00:13:58,061 --> 00:13:59,651
and just make ones that say mean things

328
00:13:59,661 --> 00:14:02,191
like "eat it" and "lick me"?

329
00:14:02,191 --> 00:14:04,991
Your big business plan is cupcakes

330
00:14:05,001 --> 00:14:07,101
that say "eat it" and "lick me"?

331
00:14:07,101 --> 00:14:09,461
And other funny things like "loser"

332
00:14:09,471 --> 00:14:11,401
or "eat your feelings."

333
00:14:11,401 --> 00:14:13,541
Hmm, why not just
shoot people in the face

334
00:14:13,541 --> 00:14:15,301
when they come to the window?

335
00:14:15,311 --> 00:14:17,271
And I thought the back of our T-shirt

336
00:14:17,271 --> 00:14:21,681
could just say, "cream filled."

337
00:14:21,681 --> 00:14:24,951
So funny if, like, a
hot girl was wearing it.

338
00:14:24,951 --> 00:14:28,981
And even funnier if it was a fat guy.

339
00:14:28,991 --> 00:14:31,751
Okay, maybe like Gordon said,

340
00:14:31,761 --> 00:14:34,591
our partner ships are going
in different directions.

341
00:14:34,591 --> 00:14:36,421
My sugar and spice
ship is going one way,

342
00:14:36,431 --> 00:14:38,191
and your mean and ugly booze cruise

343
00:14:38,191 --> 00:14:39,791
is going another.

344
00:14:39,801 --> 00:14:42,431
So how about tomorrow,
I'll sail my ship,

345
00:14:42,431 --> 00:14:44,801
and you can sail yours, Ellen.

346
00:14:44,801 --> 00:14:46,331
Done.

347
00:14:46,341 --> 00:14:48,501
And, Pam, I know you
think your ship don't sink,

348
00:14:48,511 --> 00:14:51,341
but it does.

349
00:14:59,131 --> 00:15:03,301
So, Hannah, Todd, go.

350
00:15:03,301 --> 00:15:06,771
Tell us, who is your business?

351
00:15:06,771 --> 00:15:10,371
We make guitar case suitcases.

352
00:15:10,381 --> 00:15:14,911
Yeah, they're suitcases
that look like guitar cases

353
00:15:14,911 --> 00:15:18,451
so you can look cool at the airport.

354
00:15:18,451 --> 00:15:20,251
So far, no truth balls.

355
00:15:20,251 --> 00:15:22,591
That means we believe
you're telling some truth

356
00:15:22,591 --> 00:15:23,891
of who you are.

357
00:15:23,891 --> 00:15:26,391
Business is always...

358
00:15:26,391 --> 00:15:27,591
Okay then.

359
00:15:27,591 --> 00:15:29,091
So what, their big idea

360
00:15:29,091 --> 00:15:31,291
is just throwing your
crap in a guitar case?

361
00:15:31,301 --> 00:15:34,231
Well, it's no fart-isan cupcake.

362
00:15:34,231 --> 00:15:36,971
Todd, Hannah, did you get
together with our graphic artist

363
00:15:36,971 --> 00:15:38,131
to help create a logo?

364
00:15:38,141 --> 00:15:39,601
Yes, we did.

365
00:15:39,601 --> 00:15:42,041
We stayed up all
night, and to be honest,

366
00:15:42,041 --> 00:15:45,641
it got kind of weird.

367
00:15:45,641 --> 00:15:47,281
That's our logo,

368
00:15:47,281 --> 00:15:52,051
and our company's called
"I'm With the Band."

369
00:15:54,321 --> 00:15:56,291
Back off!

370
00:15:56,291 --> 00:15:59,961
She just got out of rehab.

371
00:15:59,961 --> 00:16:02,531
Business is not for the faint of heart

372
00:16:02,531 --> 00:16:05,661
or coke addicts.

373
00:16:05,661 --> 00:16:07,131
Next up, we've got Ellen and Pam.

374
00:16:07,131 --> 00:16:09,061
Let's give 'em some love.

375
00:16:09,071 --> 00:16:10,571
Max, you're really not gonna go up there

376
00:16:10,571 --> 00:16:12,131
and sell your idea as a business plan.

377
00:16:12,141 --> 00:16:15,741
Yup, and I feel pretty good about it.

378
00:16:15,741 --> 00:16:17,841
Okay, well, then I hope
you enjoy lots of balls

379
00:16:17,841 --> 00:16:19,011
in your face.

380
00:16:19,011 --> 00:16:20,711
If I didn't at Burning Man,

381
00:16:20,711 --> 00:16:23,511
I doubt I will here.

382
00:16:23,511 --> 00:16:24,511
Gordon, hi.

383
00:16:24,521 --> 00:16:26,151
As you predicted,

384
00:16:26,151 --> 00:16:27,721
today we'll be presenting
our brands separately.

385
00:16:27,721 --> 00:16:30,851
Okay, looks like we have
us a brand off, folks.

386
00:16:30,861 --> 00:16:32,291
This is exciting.

387
00:16:32,291 --> 00:16:37,091
I am feeling it!

388
00:16:37,091 --> 00:16:39,031
Ellen, I know you're
not used to being alone.

389
00:16:39,031 --> 00:16:42,731
Neither was I, hence wife number three.

390
00:16:42,731 --> 00:16:44,031
Don't rush.

391
00:16:44,031 --> 00:16:46,871
Take some time to get yourself centered.

392
00:16:46,871 --> 00:16:49,501
Yo, yo, yo!
What's happening, Sheridan!

393
00:16:49,511 --> 00:16:50,871
Ellen in the house.

394
00:16:50,871 --> 00:16:53,241
Let me hear some noise.

395
00:16:53,241 --> 00:16:55,241
Yeah. Oh! All right, all right.

396
00:16:55,251 --> 00:16:57,811
We got some haters. That's cool.

397
00:16:57,821 --> 00:16:59,751
Ellen, did you design a logo?

398
00:16:59,751 --> 00:17:03,691
Sure did. Show it, player.

399
00:17:03,691 --> 00:17:06,661
George, she's talking to you.

400
00:17:07,791 --> 00:17:09,561
(Gordon) Oh, good impact.

401
00:17:09,561 --> 00:17:11,191
Boom, cupcake business.

402
00:17:11,201 --> 00:17:12,461
But, um...

403
00:17:12,461 --> 00:17:14,461
Where's the name of your business?

404
00:17:14,461 --> 00:17:16,601
Oh, I didn't want one.

405
00:17:16,601 --> 00:17:19,431
I just wanted it to be cool.

406
00:17:21,041 --> 00:17:22,541
So let me get this correct.

407
00:17:22,541 --> 00:17:24,641
You want to make
T-shirts for your business

408
00:17:24,641 --> 00:17:26,581
with no business connection.

409
00:17:26,581 --> 00:17:28,011
Okay.

410
00:17:28,011 --> 00:17:30,751
This is your journey,
but it might end here.

411
00:17:30,751 --> 00:17:33,621
No, no, no, see, it's a cupcake,

412
00:17:33,621 --> 00:17:39,551
and we sell cupcakes,
so that's the "bidness."

413
00:17:39,561 --> 00:17:42,661
Okay, you know what? Screw this!

414
00:17:42,661 --> 00:17:46,361
That t-shirt is way cool,
and if you can't see it,

415
00:17:46,361 --> 00:17:51,631
this seminar is so not
worth the $1,000 I paid.

416
00:17:51,641 --> 00:17:53,271
Peace out.

417
00:17:53,271 --> 00:17:56,371
[feedback whines]

418
00:17:56,371 --> 00:18:00,411
In business, we call that a meltdown.

419
00:18:00,411 --> 00:18:02,241
It happens.

420
00:18:02,251 --> 00:18:04,811
So why don't we bring up
Ellen's former partner Pam.

421
00:18:04,811 --> 00:18:06,811
Let's give Pam a round of applause.

422
00:18:06,821 --> 00:18:08,751
Max, I don't have to go up there.

423
00:18:08,751 --> 00:18:10,021
Come on, we can just leave.

424
00:18:10,021 --> 00:18:11,391
Oh, look who wants

425
00:18:11,391 --> 00:18:13,451
to pack up their guitar suitcase and go.

426
00:18:13,461 --> 00:18:14,761
You know what?

427
00:18:14,761 --> 00:18:16,161
I was only leaving 'cause you failed.

428
00:18:16,161 --> 00:18:18,131
I believe in my ideas.

429
00:18:19,901 --> 00:18:22,031
Good afternoon. Hello, hi.

430
00:18:22,031 --> 00:18:24,271
I represent Max's Homemade Cupcakes.

431
00:18:24,271 --> 00:18:26,001
(Gordon) I'm gonna stop you right there.

432
00:18:26,001 --> 00:18:27,741
Why Max's cupcakes?

433
00:18:27,741 --> 00:18:29,841
Why not Ellen's or Pam's?

434
00:18:29,841 --> 00:18:31,671
Well, um...

435
00:18:31,671 --> 00:18:35,811
Max was... Max is this
very special person

436
00:18:35,811 --> 00:18:38,811
and the inspiration
behind our whole business.

437
00:18:38,821 --> 00:18:39,981
Got it.

438
00:18:39,981 --> 00:18:41,321
So Max is an emotional touchstone

439
00:18:41,321 --> 00:18:42,781
for you and your business.

440
00:18:42,791 --> 00:18:44,391
Yes.

441
00:18:44,391 --> 00:18:45,721
Valid. Go on.

442
00:18:45,721 --> 00:18:46,991
Great.

443
00:18:46,991 --> 00:18:49,521
So the logo...

444
00:18:49,531 --> 00:18:52,661
George.

445
00:18:52,661 --> 00:18:54,601
This is our current company logo,

446
00:18:54,601 --> 00:18:56,331
And I feel it works just fine.

447
00:18:56,331 --> 00:18:59,871
I mean, if it ain't
broke, don't fix it, right?

448
00:18:59,871 --> 00:19:02,101
Okay.

449
00:19:02,101 --> 00:19:05,371
Well, the cupcake shows
a mix of sweet imagery

450
00:19:05,371 --> 00:19:08,881
because we're two girls trying
to retro-repurpose the phrase

451
00:19:08,881 --> 00:19:12,851
"sugar and spice and everything nice."

452
00:19:12,851 --> 00:19:14,681
Hey, hey! Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey!

453
00:19:14,681 --> 00:19:16,081
Leave Pam alone!

454
00:19:16,091 --> 00:19:17,651
I'm fine, Ellen.

455
00:19:17,651 --> 00:19:19,351
They can't shut me down,
because I believe in us

456
00:19:19,361 --> 00:19:21,691
and our special brand
of artisan cupcakes.

457
00:19:21,691 --> 00:19:24,261
Why?

458
00:19:31,201 --> 00:19:32,431
Give me!

459
00:19:32,431 --> 00:19:35,971
Eat it, you losers! Eat it, eat it!

460
00:19:35,971 --> 00:19:39,071
I see the truth balls have stopped.

461
00:19:39,071 --> 00:19:42,681
It looks like "eat it,
eat it, you losers,"

462
00:19:42,681 --> 00:19:46,851
might just be your brand.

463
00:19:46,851 --> 00:19:50,421
You two are a combination
of sugar and spice

464
00:19:50,421 --> 00:19:52,521
and things not so nice.

465
00:19:52,521 --> 00:19:56,321
Speaking of truth, I need you
to pay Sandra for the seminar.

466
00:19:56,331 --> 00:19:58,391
As much as I admire your pluck,

467
00:19:58,391 --> 00:20:02,101
12 trips to the pasta bar aren't free.

468
00:20:02,101 --> 00:20:04,101
- Come on, Pam.
- Yeah, let's go, Ellen.

469
00:20:04,101 --> 00:20:05,731
I'm Ellen.

470
00:20:12,571 --> 00:20:14,571
Guess what I have under my coat.

471
00:20:14,581 --> 00:20:17,881
Well, I know it's not a boob reduction.

472
00:20:17,881 --> 00:20:19,651
What do you think? Cool, huh?

473
00:20:19,651 --> 00:20:21,821
Aw, man, somebody already makes that?

474
00:20:21,821 --> 00:20:23,381
Oh, bummer.

475
00:20:23,391 --> 00:20:26,021
This is like when I thought
I invented chip-wiches.

476
00:20:26,021 --> 00:20:28,761
Should've known. I was
eating one at the time.

477
00:20:28,761 --> 00:20:30,791
No, Max, this is your shirt.

478
00:20:30,791 --> 00:20:32,431
I got the rendering from the seminar

479
00:20:32,431 --> 00:20:33,691
and had it made that.

480
00:20:33,701 --> 00:20:35,931
We can make anything in under an hour.

481
00:20:35,931 --> 00:20:37,501
You know, that place under the bridge

482
00:20:37,501 --> 00:20:40,831
near the underage bar
where you got under arrest.

483
00:20:40,841 --> 00:20:42,371
[gasps] No way.

484
00:20:42,371 --> 00:20:44,071
Oh, no way. That's hot.

485
00:20:44,071 --> 00:20:46,111
I know, and a girl at the place

486
00:20:46,111 --> 00:20:47,911
asked me where she could get one.

487
00:20:47,911 --> 00:20:49,141
Really?

488
00:20:49,141 --> 00:20:52,511
Kind of in love with myself right now.

489
00:20:52,511 --> 00:20:54,611
Hey, what made you change
your mind about the T-shirts?

490
00:20:54,621 --> 00:20:56,251
Well, one of the things
I learned at Wharton

491
00:20:56,251 --> 00:20:58,351
is that success depends on staying open

492
00:20:58,351 --> 00:21:00,791
to a better idea,
even if it's not yours.

493
00:21:00,791 --> 00:21:02,961
- Aw.
- And here.

494
00:21:02,961 --> 00:21:04,991
I thought you'd rather a black one.

495
00:21:04,991 --> 00:21:09,401
On Tinder and in life.
