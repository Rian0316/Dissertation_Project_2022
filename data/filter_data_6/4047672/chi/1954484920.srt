1
00:00:01,801 --> 00:00:03,368
我叫Max 我是你们的服务员
I'm Max. I'll be your waitress,

2
00:00:03,370 --> 00:00:05,754
因为他们在这里不做背景调查
'cause they don't do background checks here.

3
00:00:05,756 --> 00:00:07,817
我知道你是我们的服务员
Oh, you'll be our waitress.

4
00:00:07,817 --> 00:00:09,738
我绝不是根据制服进行猜测的
I never guessed that based on the uniform

5
00:00:09,738 --> 00:00:12,308
也不是因为你的名牌上写了"Max"
and name tag that says "Max."

6
00:00:13,322 --> 00:00:16,490
你知道我能赚个三美元吗?
You know I make, like, $3, right?

7
00:00:16,492 --> 00:00:18,658
这在九十世纪二十年代可是一笔巨款了
I realize that's a lot of money in the 1920s

8
00:00:18,660 --> 00:00:21,461
就是你们处于的那个时代
where you two are from.

9
00:00:21,463 --> 00:00:24,533
把这酒打开 给我们拿两个干净的玻璃杯
Here, open this and bring us two clean glasses.

10
00:00:24,533 --> 00:00:27,150
当然可以 不伟大的盖茨比
Sure, Not-So-Great Gatsby.

11
00:00:28,819 --> 00:00:30,787
嘿 杀人犯及前妻
Hey, OJ and Nicole.

12
00:00:33,491 --> 00:00:36,126
十号桌有几个粗鲁的势利鬼 你懂的
Rude snobs at table ten. You know what that means.

13
00:00:36,128 --> 00:00:38,795
- 把酒掉包?  - 来吧
- Wine swap?  - Let's roll.

14
00:00:40,498 --> 00:00:43,049
嘿 Oleg 我要一瓶那种从你表兄脖子
Hey, Oleg, I need one of those $2 Merlots

15
00:00:43,051 --> 00:00:46,052
插孔搞出来的 两块钱一瓶的梅洛红酒
you get from your cousin with the hole in his neck.

16
00:00:46,054 --> 00:00:47,554
Caroline 查一下这个多少钱
Caroline, price check.

17
00:00:47,556 --> 00:00:51,975
哇! 这是柏菲酒庄2008年产的 很贵啊
Oh! Chateau Pavie, 2008. Very expensive.

18
00:00:51,977 --> 00:00:53,476
不过 这是我们应得的
But, hey, we deserve it.

19
00:00:55,012 --> 00:00:56,563
给你 最好给它透透气
Here, better let it breathe.

20
00:00:56,565 --> 00:00:58,848
之前它被放在我的运动包里了
It was in my gym bag.

21
00:01:00,317 --> 00:01:01,518
没问题
Not a problem.

22
00:01:01,520 --> 00:01:04,487
这对复古夫妻喜欢护身三角绷带
This vintage pairs well with jockstrap.

23
00:01:04,489 --> 00:01:07,157
你认为在我有钱的时候 服务员也是这样对我的吗
Do you think waitresses did this to me when I had money?

24
00:01:07,159 --> 00:01:09,025
如果你态度不好就会
Only if you had an attitude.

25
00:01:09,027 --> 00:01:11,945
看来答案是会了
So that's a yes.

26
00:01:11,947 --> 00:01:14,030
我都有点记不清了
I can't remember if this reminds me

27
00:01:14,032 --> 00:01:17,517
这让我想起自己在参与打劫时
of an old heist movie I saw on an old heist

28
00:01:17,519 --> 00:01:20,086
看到的一个关于打劫的电影
I actually participated in.

29
00:01:20,088 --> 00:01:23,757
我们像是便利店版的11罗汉
I know. We're like Ocean's 7/11.

30
00:01:23,759 --> 00:01:25,508
现在我们就缺一个小个子的
All we're missing is a tiny asian guy

31
00:01:25,510 --> 00:01:27,177
可以装进小箱子的亚洲男人
who can fit into small boxes.

32
00:01:27,179 --> 00:01:30,263
你们好
Hello.

33
00:01:30,265 --> 00:01:32,715
十号桌在等着上酒呢
Table ten is looking for their wine.

34
00:01:32,717 --> 00:01:35,552
没问题 这就来
Oh, not a problem. Coming right up.

35
00:01:35,554 --> 00:01:38,271
你们干什么了? 她在笑什么?
What did you do? Why is she smiling?

36
00:01:38,273 --> 00:01:41,741
我的裤子又着火了吗?
Are my pants on fire again?

37

Oh, yeah, take that, sucker!

40
00:02:03,269 --> 00:02:04,427
Max 当我说
Max, when I said

41
00:02:04,428 --> 00:02:05,737
我们得把纸杯蛋糕拿开
we need to move the cupcakes,

42
00:02:05,739 --> 00:02:08,583
我是叫你别把蛋糕扔到啮齿目动物的头上
I didn't mean through the air at a rodent's head.

43
00:02:08,583 --> 00:02:11,584
嘿 它刚刚跑到窗户上去了
Hey, he ran up the window,

44
00:02:11,586 --> 00:02:14,754
所以现在是坚守阵地的问题了
so it's kind of a stand-your-ground situation.

45
00:02:16,841 --> 00:02:20,426
好了 我们暂停一会 他在吃我的弹药
Okay, we're on a time-out. He's eating my ammo.

46
00:02:20,428 --> 00:02:22,478
Max 生意又下滑了
Max, business is down again,

47
00:02:22,480 --> 00:02:24,263
而我说的比这话还多的就是
and the only phrase I've said more than that is,

48
00:02:24,265 --> 00:02:26,682
"神啊 让我在睡梦中死去吧"
"Please, god, take me in my sleep."

49
00:02:26,684 --> 00:02:28,935
很显然 没什么进展啊
I mean, it's clear. Not getting ahead.

50
00:02:28,937 --> 00:02:31,771
噢 你心情不好就是因为这个?
Oh, is that what your mood is about?

51
00:02:31,773 --> 00:02:34,206
因为没有人进你?
You're not getting any ahead?

52
00:02:34,208 --> 00:02:36,442
因为我只要一通电话就能帮你解决
'cause I can take care of that with one call.

53
00:02:36,444 --> 00:02:38,044
你不能把我介绍给那个在你手机里
You are not hooking me up with that guy

54
00:02:38,046 --> 00:02:41,914
标注着"口交巴克"的家伙
who's listed in your phone as "oral redenbacher."

55
00:02:43,467 --> 00:02:44,951
Max 这是我们的未来
Max, this is our future.

56
00:02:44,953 --> 00:02:47,086
我们得认真赚钱
We need to get serious about making money.

57
00:02:47,088 --> 00:02:50,456
当然 我们早点走吧
Absolutely. Let's leave early.

58
00:02:50,458 --> 00:02:53,843
早退? 你当我们是谁啊 国会?
Leave early? Who are we, Congress?

59
00:02:53,845 --> 00:02:55,962
你以为其他人做生意是
Do you think other business got successful

60
00:02:55,964 --> 00:02:57,296
靠早退成功的吗?
by leaving early?

61
00:02:57,298 --> 00:02:59,098
当然不 他们成功是因为他们
No, they did it by hiring illegals

62
00:02:59,100 --> 00:03:03,302
雇佣了非法移民 并把财产转移到海外
and moving their bank accounts offshore.

63
00:03:03,304 --> 00:03:04,470
我们不能早退
We can't leave early.

64
00:03:04,472 --> 00:03:06,722
这标牌上写着"营业时间到凌晨两点"
The sign says "open till 2:00 a.m."

65
00:03:06,724 --> 00:03:10,810
好吧 我打算换张新牌子 上面写着"关门"
Well, I'm open to getting a new sign that says "closed."

66
00:03:10,812 --> 00:03:12,695
我是说 难道我们就应该呆在这里
I mean, are we supposed to just hang around here

67
00:03:12,697 --> 00:03:15,865
等哪个闲逛的神经病来我们店吗?
and wait for whatever nut jobs are trolling around town?

68
00:03:15,867 --> 00:03:17,700
大家好
Hi, girls.

69
00:03:19,886 --> 00:03:21,988
你们猜我和Oleg打算做件什么
Guess what Oleg and I are going to do

70
00:03:21,990 --> 00:03:24,874
可能会让我得丙肝的事吗
that will probably give me hep c.

71
00:03:24,876 --> 00:03:28,127
和汤米・李玩三人行?
A three way with Tommy Lee?

72
00:03:28,129 --> 00:03:31,998
别傻了 我们是要去纹个情侣纹身
No, silly. We're getting matching tattoos.

73
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:34,950
我们想要个可以代表我们关系的图样
We want something that represents our relationship.

74
00:03:34,952 --> 00:03:37,453
可以纹两只在"犯罪现场调查: 迈阿密"中
So maybe two butterflies doing the nasty

75
00:03:37,455 --> 00:03:40,006
嘿咻的蝴蝶
during "CSI: Miami."

76
00:03:40,008 --> 00:03:42,308
哇 你们两个真不错 一对纹身
Wow, you two, his and her tats.

77
00:03:42,310 --> 00:03:45,644
很浪漫 还能有助于辨别尸体
Romantic and will help identify the bodies.

78
00:03:45,646 --> 00:03:48,481
当然 情侣纹身
Sure, you know, matching tattoos

79
00:03:48,483 --> 00:03:51,350
最能表达承诺的方式
are the deepest expression of commitment.

80
00:03:51,352 --> 00:03:52,902
对的 情侣纹身
Well, matching tattoos

81
00:03:52,904 --> 00:03:56,989
以及在对方面前拉屎
and pooping in front of each other.

82
00:03:56,991 --> 00:03:59,492
我可不会在我男人面前拉屎
I'm not gonna do it in front of my man.

83
00:03:59,494 --> 00:04:03,913
我在麦当劳拉屎 因为我是个淑女
I poop at McDonald's 'cause I'm a lady.

84
00:04:03,915 --> 00:04:06,532
谢谢你们的纸杯蛋糕
Thanks for the cupcake.

85
00:04:06,534 --> 00:04:08,834
我们真应该算她的账
We really have to start charging her.

86
00:04:08,836 --> 00:04:12,671
算她啥账啊 一级搞定男人罪?
Charge her with what, first-degree man-settling?

87
00:04:12,673 --> 00:04:14,874
Max 我之前也说了 我们该
Max, as I was saying, it's time to get serious

88
00:04:14,876 --> 00:04:16,208
认真对待这个生意了
about the business.

89
00:04:16,210 --> 00:04:18,761
当然 我们提早离开吧
Absolutely. Let's leave early.

90
00:04:18,763 --> 00:04:20,679
怎么了? 昨晚一点钟过后
What? Last night after 1:00,

91
00:04:20,681 --> 00:04:22,598
我们只赚了15美元 对吧?
we made only $15, right?

92
00:04:22,600 --> 00:04:25,101
其实是14.63美元
$14.63.

93
00:04:25,103 --> 00:04:26,852
怎么 我很拿手数学啊
What? Math is my thing.

94
00:04:26,854 --> 00:04:28,554
如果你看到艾米纳姆在你对面开始说唱
Would you roll your eyes if you were standing

95
00:04:28,556 --> 00:04:31,524
你还会翻白眼吗
across from Eminem and he started rapping?

96
00:04:31,526 --> 00:04:34,527
当然
Uh, yes.

97
00:04:34,529 --> 00:04:37,813
我会说"老兄 你都六十岁了 洗洗睡吧"
I'd be all, "Dude, you're 60. Sit on a porch swing."

98
00:04:39,449 --> 00:04:41,484
好吧 你看 这里有15美元
Okay, look, here is $15.

99
00:04:41,486 --> 00:04:43,619
差不多就是我们能赚的钱了
That'll cover what we'll probably make.

100
00:04:43,621 --> 00:04:45,154
我要走了
I'm leaving.

101
00:04:45,156 --> 00:04:46,822
你就打算把我抛在这里?
You're just gonna leave me here?

102
00:04:46,824 --> 00:04:48,624
是的 等你把那14.63美元的差价找给我
Yup, I'm leaving as soon as I get my change back

103
00:04:48,626 --> 00:04:51,127
我就马上走
from that $14.63.

104
00:04:51,129 --> 00:04:53,963
好啊 告诉我我该找你多少钱
Fine, just tell me how much that is.

105
00:04:53,965 --> 00:04:56,082
我还是早点走吧
Or maybe sooner.

106
00:04:59,086 --> 00:05:02,138
这是个很重要的日子
This is a very big day for me.

107
00:05:02,140 --> 00:05:04,640
为什么? 因为这个商业研讨会
Why, because of this totally out-of-the-blue order

108
00:05:04,642 --> 00:05:06,675
给咱们来了个突如其来的蛋糕订单?
we got to do cupcakes for this business seminar?

109
00:05:06,677 --> 00:05:09,261
当然不是 今天是我第一次从大门
No, the first time I've entered a Sheridan

110
00:05:09,263 --> 00:05:11,814
走进喜来登酒店
through a door.

111
00:05:11,816 --> 00:05:14,817
我通常都是翻窗或者走货运电梯的
Usually it's by window or freight elevator.

112
00:05:14,819 --> 00:05:17,153
还有一次 我躲在一个女孩的
And one time, I rolled in under some girl's

113
00:05:17,155 --> 00:05:19,688
裙子下钻进来的
Quinceara dress.

114
00:05:19,690 --> 00:05:21,440
研讨会马上就要开始了
The seminar's about to start.

115
00:05:21,442 --> 00:05:25,244
这里仍有几个名牌没人拿的 Pamela和Ellen...
I have unclaimed name tags for Pamela, Ellen...

116
00:05:25,246 --> 00:05:27,113
有什么烂人会来这种地方?
What kind of losers would come to this?

117
00:05:27,115 --> 00:05:30,199
还有Max和Caroline
Max, Caroline.

118
00:05:30,201 --> 00:05:31,951
我可不会称我们为烂人
I wouldn't call us losers.

119
00:05:31,953 --> 00:05:33,452
你们来了吗?
Are you here?

120
00:05:33,454 --> 00:05:36,122
好吧 其实没有人订纸杯蛋糕
Okay, so there is no cupcake order.

121
00:05:36,124 --> 00:05:38,007
我给咱们报名参加这研讨会
I signed us up for this seminar.

122
00:05:38,009 --> 00:05:41,844
我白白拿着这么多纸杯蛋糕挤了一路地铁?
I carried cupcakes on a subway for nothing?

123
00:05:41,846 --> 00:05:46,515
坐我旁边的唠叨女人可是说了一路啊
The annoying woman next to me talked the whole time.

124
00:05:46,517 --> 00:05:50,769
Max 坐你旁边的人是我
I was sitting next to you, Max.

125
00:05:50,771 --> 00:05:52,638
我知道你是怎么都不肯来的
Look, I knew you wouldn't come otherwise,

126
00:05:52,640 --> 00:05:54,523
而且你确实需要来这一趟
and you need to be here.

127
00:05:54,525 --> 00:05:56,725
你这叫商业干预
This is a business intervention.

128
00:05:56,727 --> 00:05:59,695
这不是干预
It's not an intervention.

129
00:05:59,697 --> 00:06:01,647
Man 你最近的表现在以下几个
Max, your behavior lately has affected me

130
00:06:01,649 --> 00:06:04,984
方面影响到了我
in the following ways.

131
00:06:04,986 --> 00:06:06,318
有没有搞错
I can't believe this.

132
00:06:06,320 --> 00:06:09,205
最起码其他的劝诫会上我是醉着的
At least in my other interventions I was drunk.

133
00:06:09,207 --> 00:06:11,157
我们需要这次讲座
We need to do this seminar.

134
00:06:11,159 --> 00:06:12,825
Gordon Kepper是个天才
Gordon Kepper is a genius.

135
00:06:12,827 --> 00:06:14,660
他会让我们的生意达到高潮的
He's gonna give our business a real bump.

136
00:06:14,662 --> 00:06:16,829
我第二次劝诫会就是因为
Guys giving me a bump is why they threw me

137
00:06:16,831 --> 00:06:19,548
那些给我高潮的家伙
that second intervention.

138
00:06:19,550 --> 00:06:20,833
我们走吧
Let's go.

139
00:06:20,835 --> 00:06:23,002
好吧 你不走我走
Oh, mm, okay. See you.

140
00:06:23,004 --> 00:06:24,720
这就是你的新爱好吗 Max?
So this is your new thing, Max?

141
00:06:24,722 --> 00:06:26,138
你就这么扔下我不管了?
You're just gonna walk out on me?

142
00:06:26,140 --> 00:06:27,907
实际上 这是老习惯了
Actually, it's an old thing.

143
00:06:27,909 --> 00:06:30,643
其实 这算是家庭传统了
In fact, it's kind of a family tradition.

144
00:06:30,645 --> 00:06:34,480
我从我爸那里学来的 虽然不知道他是谁
I learned from my father, whoever he is.

145
00:06:34,482 --> 00:06:36,732
拜托 就两天而已
Come on. It's just two days.

146
00:06:36,734 --> 00:06:38,901
两天? 没门
Two days? No way.

147
00:06:38,903 --> 00:06:40,269
绝对不可能
No freaking way.

148
00:06:40,271 --> 00:06:41,737
这里有自助餐和甜点吧
There's a buffet and a dessert bar.

149
00:06:41,739 --> 00:06:43,155
没问题
Ooh, okay.

150
00:06:44,741 --> 00:06:46,659
等一下 我去交钱 我带了点现金
Wait here, I'll go pay. I brought some cash.

151
00:06:46,661 --> 00:06:48,694
过期的超市礼品卡也能用的 对吧?
And they'll take an expired Target gift card, right?

152
00:06:48,696 --> 00:06:51,197
我们才不交钱
Oh, we are not paying.

153
00:06:51,199 --> 00:06:53,249
这里 给你 Pamela
Here. Here, Pamela.

154
00:06:53,251 --> 00:06:55,868
跟着Ellen去货运电梯吧
Follow Ellen to the freight elevator.

155
00:06:55,870 --> 00:06:58,087
不行 Max 我们不能溜进去
No way, Max. We are not sneaking in.

156
00:06:58,089 --> 00:07:00,789
- 这玩意儿多少钱?  - 一千刀
- How much is this thing?  - $1,000.

157
00:07:00,791 --> 00:07:02,958
我们得溜进去 Ellen
We're sneaking in, Ellen.

158
00:07:10,356 --> 00:07:11,940
各位 你们今天在此
Now, you all are here today

159
00:07:11,942 --> 00:07:14,279
不只是要找到自己在商业中的定位
not only to find out what you are as a business

160
00:07:14,279 --> 00:07:17,269
还要找到人生方向
but to find out who you are.

161
00:07:17,269 --> 00:07:19,102
我的人生目标就是希望自助餐
I'm a lady hoping there's macaroni and cheese

162
00:07:19,104 --> 00:07:20,979
有通心粉和奶酪
at that buffet.

163
00:07:20,979 --> 00:07:23,262
你自己就是品牌
Who are you is your brand,

164
00:07:23,264 --> 00:07:24,897
说品牌不过是个名字
and saying that a brand is simply a name

165
00:07:24,899 --> 00:07:28,935
就好像说亚伯拉罕・林肯不过就是代号而已
is like saying Abraham Lincoln is simply a name,

166
00:07:28,937 --> 00:07:32,905
还有圣雄甘地 上帝
or Mahatma Gandhi, God.

167
00:07:32,907 --> 00:07:35,775
这家伙以为自己是谁啊?
Who does this guy think he is?

168
00:07:35,777 --> 00:07:38,411
你肯定正在想 "这家伙以为自己是谁啊?"
I'm sure you're wondering, "who does this guy think he is?"

169
00:07:40,447 --> 00:07:41,948
好吧 这也太诡异了
Okay, that was weird.

170
00:07:41,950 --> 00:07:44,751
或者是想着这挺诡异的
Or maybe this seems weird.

171
00:07:46,170 --> 00:07:48,171
我起鸡皮疙瘩了
I've got chills.

172
00:07:48,173 --> 00:07:49,455
一谈到生意
When it comes to business,

173
00:07:49,457 --> 00:07:50,840
大家总是来找我
people come up to me all the time.

174
00:07:50,842 --> 00:07:52,625
他们说 "Gordon 做生意太难了
They say, "Gordon, business is hard,

175
00:07:52,627 --> 00:07:54,794
但我已经尽力了"
but I do what I can."

176
00:07:54,796 --> 00:07:57,180
然后他们耸耸肩 请问 这是正确的态度吗?
And they shrug. Now, is that the right attitude?

177
00:07:57,182 --> 00:08:00,099
- 不是  - 是
- No.  - Yes.

178
00:08:00,101 --> 00:08:03,803
对这些人 我说 "不要只是尽力
To those people, I say, "don't do what you can.

179
00:08:03,805 --> 00:08:05,271
要竭尽全力"
Can what you do."

180
00:08:05,273 --> 00:08:07,440
不要只是尽力
Don't do what you can.

181
00:08:07,442 --> 00:08:09,192
要竭尽全力! 懂了吗?
Can what you do! Get it?

182
00:08:09,194 --> 00:08:10,359
懂了吗?
Do you get it?

183
00:08:10,361 --> 00:08:12,812
- 是  - 没有
- Yes.  - No.

184
00:08:12,814 --> 00:08:14,981
- 你根本没懂  - 嘘
- You did not get it.  - Shh.

185
00:08:14,983 --> 00:08:16,816
好了 各位 把手伸到座位下面
All right, everybody, reach under your chairs

186
00:08:16,818 --> 00:08:18,117
看看找到了什么
and pick up what you find there.

187
00:08:18,119 --> 00:08:20,653
希望是出去的方法
Hope it's a way out of here.

188
00:08:22,823 --> 00:08:24,207
毛毛球?
Koosh balls?

189
00:08:24,209 --> 00:08:27,126
在这些罐子里 你能找到
Inside those cans, you will find the key

190
00:08:27,128 --> 00:08:28,961
商业成功的方法
to success in your business.

191
00:08:28,963 --> 00:08:31,164
如果所谓的方法就是罗茜・奥唐纳
Not unless the key is Rosie O'Donnell's career

192
00:08:31,166 --> 00:08:34,167
剪西瓜头前的样子
before her buzz cut.

193
00:08:34,169 --> 00:08:35,968
真诚
Truth.

194
00:08:35,970 --> 00:08:37,754
这就是生意的秘诀
That's the big secret to business.

195
00:08:37,756 --> 00:08:39,889
如果人们相信你的话
If people buy what you're saying,

196
00:08:39,891 --> 00:08:42,058
他们就会去买你的货
they will buy what you're selling.

197
00:08:42,060 --> 00:08:45,428
Max 好好听 这分分钟变成商业圣会
Max, stay alert. This could go to cult like that.

198
00:08:45,430 --> 00:08:47,346
我喜欢把你们手中拿着的东西
I like to think of those things you're holding

199
00:08:47,348 --> 00:08:51,250
视为我的真理球
as my truth balls.

200
00:08:55,272 --> 00:08:59,192
得了吧 不如直接说是肉丸
Screw this. Let's get to the meatballs.

201
00:08:59,194 --> 00:09:00,860
在接下来的两天里
Anytime in the next two days,

202
00:09:00,862 --> 00:09:02,528
你们中随时有人会上台来推销
one of you is up here selling you something

203
00:09:02,530 --> 00:09:04,864
你觉得是胡说八道的东西
that you feel is just bull,

204
00:09:04,866 --> 00:09:06,699
那就扔出去...
Then toss it...

205
00:09:06,701 --> 00:09:07,750
Max啊!
Max!

206
00:09:07,752 --> 00:09:10,703
我是说 Ellen!
I mean, Ellen!

207
00:09:10,705 --> 00:09:14,040
没错 亲
Yeah, baby.

208
00:09:14,042 --> 00:09:16,709
我说的就是这样
That is what I'm talking about.

209
00:09:16,711 --> 00:09:18,044
扔球的人是个不畏艰险
Whoever threw that is not afraid

210
00:09:18,046 --> 00:09:19,095
勇往直前的人
to really go for it,

211
00:09:19,097 --> 00:09:20,763
这会助她在成功路上
And that will go a long way

212
00:09:20,765 --> 00:09:22,598
走很远的
toward success in business.

213
00:09:22,600 --> 00:09:24,801
好吧 但是去自助的路远吗?
All right, cool, but it is a long way to the buffet?

214
00:09:24,803 --> 00:09:26,936
因为老娘都快饿死了
'Cause I am starving.

215
00:09:29,022 --> 00:09:30,690
好了 各位
Okay, everyone.

216
00:09:30,692 --> 00:09:32,525
把这些你们分成的小组
consider these small groups you've broken into

217
00:09:32,527 --> 00:09:34,277
视为小的智囊团们
as little think tanks.

218
00:09:34,279 --> 00:09:37,363
我希望你们齐心协力想出最好的点子
I need you to work together and bring out your very best.

219
00:09:38,566 --> 00:09:40,316
Max啊!
Max!

220
00:09:40,318 --> 00:09:41,734
别怪我
Don't blame me.

221
00:09:41,736 --> 00:09:43,953
要怪意大利宽面上的奶油太多
Blame the heavy cream at the fettuccini bar.

222
00:09:43,955 --> 00:09:48,241
意大利人肯定把芝士当"安眠药"了
Alfredo must be Italian for "roofie."

223
00:09:48,243 --> 00:09:50,493
那么 Ellen 告诉我们你会什么
So, Ellen, tell us what you have,

224
00:09:50,495 --> 00:09:53,412
我就告诉你我们的想法
and I'll tell you what we think.

225
00:09:53,414 --> 00:09:54,831
哦 Ellen 说你呢
Oh, Ellen. That's you.

226
00:09:54,833 --> 00:09:56,833
哦哦 对 是我
Oh, oh, yes, yes, that's me.

227
00:09:56,835 --> 00:09:58,751
我是Ellen 如假包换的Ellen
I'm Ellen. Definitely an Ellen.

228
00:09:58,753 --> 00:10:00,636
看到没 我会跳舞
See, I dance.

229
00:10:04,558 --> 00:10:05,842
很好
Okay.

230
00:10:07,761 --> 00:10:11,597
好吧 这下真的好尴尬
Okay. Okay, now it's weird.

231
00:10:11,599 --> 00:10:13,649
那么 Ellen...
So, Ellen...

232
00:10:15,352 --> 00:10:17,270
让我们听听你的BBB论...
Let's hear your B.B.B....

233
00:10:17,272 --> 00:10:20,273
你才智卓绝的生意品牌
Your brilliant business brand.

234
00:10:20,275 --> 00:10:21,274
呃...
Uh...

235
00:10:23,995 --> 00:10:26,329
我... 我平常不说话 Pamela负责发言
I... I don't do the talking. Pamela does the talking.

236
00:10:26,331 --> 00:10:27,663
- Pam?  - 谢谢 Ellen
- Pam?  - Thanks, Ellen.

237
00:10:27,665 --> 00:10:32,285
大家好 我叫Pam Panning
Hello, everyone, my name is Pam Panning,

238
00:10:32,287 --> 00:10:34,754
我的生意伙伴 Ellen 想说的是
And what my partner, Ellen, was trying to say is,

239
00:10:34,756 --> 00:10:37,757
我们做的杯糕工艺精湛
we making very beautiful artisan cupcakes.

240
00:10:37,759 --> 00:10:39,709
没错 但同时很酷
Yeah, but they're still cool.

241
00:10:39,711 --> 00:10:41,544
我也没说它们不酷啊
I never said they weren't cool.

242
00:10:41,546 --> 00:10:43,462
哼 或许因为从你嘴里说出来
Yeah, mm, maybe they just didn't sound cool

243
00:10:43,464 --> 00:10:47,049
就显得不酷了
coming out of your face.

244
00:10:47,051 --> 00:10:48,684
不好意思 至少能说出话
I'm sorry, but at least actual words

245
00:10:48,686 --> 00:10:51,137
好过你的"呃呃呃..."
Are better than, "uh, uh-uh, uh..."

246
00:10:51,139 --> 00:10:53,189
女士们 暂停一下
Ladies, hold.

247
00:10:53,191 --> 00:10:54,941
有时在生意上
Sometimes in business

248
00:10:54,943 --> 00:10:59,061
合作伙伴就像是两艘驶向不同方向的船
partner' ships will sail in two different directions,

249
00:10:59,063 --> 00:11:01,063
这时你们需要明确 你们是
so you two need to find out if you're gonna continue

250
00:11:01,065 --> 00:11:04,150
分道扬镳 还是转变航线
to sail apart or if you're gonna change course

251
00:11:04,152 --> 00:11:08,237
重新达成共识
and reconvene at the port of mutual understanding.

252
00:11:08,239 --> 00:11:10,656
我俩没法分得太开
Well, we can't sail too far apart

253
00:11:10,658 --> 00:11:12,325
因为我肯定还得跟她解释
'cause I'm definitely gonna have to explain

254
00:11:12,327 --> 00:11:15,494
你刚刚说的话
what you just said to her.

255
00:11:15,496 --> 00:11:17,330
我听懂了
I got it.

256
00:11:17,332 --> 00:11:20,333
我是艘船 而且我想要离你远点
I'm a boat, and I'm trying to get away from you.

257
00:11:20,335 --> 00:11:23,336
说得太对了
Sounds right to me.

258
00:11:23,338 --> 00:11:24,804
好好想想
Think it over.

259
00:11:24,806 --> 00:11:26,889
跟你的大副商量一下
Talk it over with your first mate.

260
00:11:29,644 --> 00:11:30,977
明天回来
Come back tomorrow

261
00:11:30,979 --> 00:11:33,179
告诉我你们的生意是什么
and tell me who your business is,

262
00:11:33,181 --> 00:11:35,014
我会指导你们朝着目标前进
and I'll help guide you toward that purpose.

263
00:11:35,016 --> 00:11:37,533
记住 你要想爆发 就得...
And remember, you can't purpose without...

264
00:11:37,535 --> 00:11:40,319
- 找个阴道 - 好了 够了
- Puss.  - Okay, wow.

265
00:11:40,321 --> 00:11:43,406
Gordon 她的船现在像是进入浅水区了
Gordon, her boat's kind of in shallow water right now,

266
00:11:43,408 --> 00:11:45,191
但我们准备回去 达成共识
but we're gonna go away, get it together,

267
00:11:45,193 --> 00:11:47,159
再回来让你大吃一惊
and come back and blow you away.

268
00:11:47,161 --> 00:11:49,328
"大吃一惊"需要...
And you can't spell "blow you away" without...

269
00:11:49,330 --> 00:11:50,613
我们的船要开走了
Our ship's leaving.

270
00:11:54,534 --> 00:11:55,835
哦 你们好
Oh, hello.

271
00:11:55,837 --> 00:11:57,703
欢迎来到威廉斯堡小餐厅
Welcome to the Williamsburg diner.

272
00:11:57,705 --> 00:12:03,092
请问需要来点什么 比如说职业道德?
Can I get you anything, like a work ethic?

273
00:12:03,094 --> 00:12:05,928
Han 你真是太可爱了 但我们忙着呢
Han, this is adorable, but we're busy.

274
00:12:05,930 --> 00:12:07,596
我们正在定位我们的商业品牌
We're pitching our business brand tomorrow,

275
00:12:07,598 --> 00:12:09,432
我和Max需要达成共识
and Max and I need to get on the same page.

276
00:12:09,434 --> 00:12:10,599
没错 我们不想下半辈子
Yeah, we don't want to work here

277
00:12:10,601 --> 00:12:12,435
还在这里干活
the rest of our lives.

278
00:12:12,437 --> 00:12:15,721
现在我们达成共识了
Well, now we're all on the same page.

279
00:12:15,723 --> 00:12:17,106
Han 给我们十分钟就好
Han, just give us ten minutes.

280
00:12:17,108 --> 00:12:18,441
然后我们就回去工作
Then we'll get to work.

281
00:12:18,443 --> 00:12:19,725
好吧 我都等了四年了
Well, I've waited four years.

282
00:12:19,727 --> 00:12:21,060
再等十分钟又怎样?
What's another ten minutes?

283
00:12:22,729 --> 00:12:24,697
Max 我不得不说我被你
Max, I have to say I was a little thrown

284
00:12:24,699 --> 00:12:26,315
今天说的话给吓到了
by that thing you said today.

285
00:12:26,317 --> 00:12:28,117
哪句 我说我最棒的性体验是
What, that the best sex I've ever had

286
00:12:28,119 --> 00:12:30,953
自己独自坐大摆锤的时候?
was alone on the tilt-a-whirl?

287
00:12:30,955 --> 00:12:34,123
不 这怎么吓得了我 你每天都这么说的
No, why would that throw me? You say that every day.

288
00:12:34,125 --> 00:12:36,792
不 是你说我听起来不酷的那话儿
No, that thing about me not sounding cool.

289
00:12:36,794 --> 00:12:40,079
这句怎么吓到你了? 我每天都说这种话
Why would that throw you? I say it every day.

290
00:12:40,081 --> 00:12:42,581
对 但以前说的不是做生意
Yes, but not about the business.

291
00:12:42,583 --> 00:12:44,800
这叫什么来着? "艺工"?
So what was it? The word "artisan"?

292
00:12:44,802 --> 00:12:50,423
首先 它听起来像"屁工"
Okay, first of all, it sounds like fart-isan,

293
00:12:50,425 --> 00:12:54,093
好比"现在这里就有人放了个屁"
As in, "a fart is in this room right now."

294
00:12:54,095 --> 00:12:57,930
终于有人跟你说出这话了 Caroline
Somebody finally called you out on it, Caroline.

295
00:13:00,400 --> 00:13:02,485
所以我想的口号是
So I was thinking our slogan could be,

296
00:13:02,487 --> 00:13:05,855
"Max自制的纸杯蛋糕 又甜又香"
"Max's homemade cupcakes. Sugar and spice."

297
00:13:05,857 --> 00:13:08,407
我宁愿用"屁工"
I'd rather go with fart-isan.

298
00:13:08,409 --> 00:13:09,775
真的吗 瘪四?
Really, beavis?

299
00:13:08,409 --> 00:13:12,945
{\an8}Beavis and Butt-head:瘪四与大头蛋 重口卡通片

300
00:13:09,777 --> 00:13:12,945
你的合作伙伴大头蛋是怎么想的?
What does your business partner butthead think?

301
00:13:12,947 --> 00:13:14,413
我们的店都没什么活儿
Our business isn't working.

302
00:13:14,415 --> 00:13:16,282
猜猜谁在干活
Well, guess who is working.

303
00:13:16,284 --> 00:13:18,000
是我 餐厅老板
Me, the damn owner.

304
00:13:20,454 --> 00:13:21,787
你惊讶什么?
Why are you surprised?

305
00:13:21,789 --> 00:13:23,873
你知道有多少纸杯蛋糕卖不出去
You know how many cupcakes were not selling.

306
00:13:23,875 --> 00:13:26,208
你一晚上至少偷吃六个蛋糕
I mean, you're secretly eating at least six a night

307
00:13:26,210 --> 00:13:28,127
好让我以为我们卖得更多了
to make me think we're selling more.

308
00:13:28,129 --> 00:13:31,764
也因为我心情不好
Also 'cause I'm sad.

309
00:13:31,766 --> 00:13:34,850
听着 我知道你上过沃顿商学院 但是...
Look, I know you went to Wharton and all, but...

310
00:13:34,852 --> 00:13:36,635
等等..,
Wait...

311
00:13:36,637 --> 00:13:38,437
什么情况?
What's happening?

312
00:13:38,439 --> 00:13:42,191
这是对我的商业干预吗?
Is this a business intervention on me?

313
00:13:42,193 --> 00:13:43,776
从那个把"生意"
From someone who pronounces

314
00:13:43,778 --> 00:13:47,696
读成"伤意"的人嘴里说出?
the word business "bidness"?

315
00:13:47,698 --> 00:13:49,732
你干嘛一副瞪大眼睛的表情?
Why are you giving me the big eye-painting face?

316
00:13:49,734 --> 00:13:51,400
你知道我们的生意不好
You knew the business wasn't working.

317
00:13:51,402 --> 00:13:53,736
但我没听你提过任何想法
Well, I don't hear you coming up with any ideas.

318
00:13:53,738 --> 00:13:55,037
那是因为你从来不听
That's 'cause you don't listen.

319
00:13:55,039 --> 00:13:56,705
我说过我们应该不再做
Remember when I said we should stop making

320
00:13:56,707 --> 00:13:57,957
那种花哨的纸杯蛋糕
all these flowery cupcakes

321
00:13:57,959 --> 00:13:59,542
而是直接写上刻薄的话
and just make ones that say mean things

322
00:13:59,544 --> 00:14:02,161
比如"去死" "舔我"?
like "eat it" and "lick me"?

323
00:14:02,163 --> 00:14:04,964
你宏大的生意计划就是在蛋糕上
Your big business plan is cupcakes

324
00:14:04,966 --> 00:14:06,999
写"去死"和"舔我"?
that say "eat it" and "lick me"?

325
00:14:07,001 --> 00:14:09,335
还有别的 比如说"潘"
And other funny things like "loser"

326
00:14:09,337 --> 00:14:11,337
或者是"回味无穷"
or "eat your feelings."

327
00:14:11,339 --> 00:14:13,506
嗯 那还不如在顾客来到窗边时
Hmm, why not just shoot people in the face

328
00:14:13,508 --> 00:14:15,174
直接射他们一脸呢?
when they come to the window?

329
00:14:15,176 --> 00:14:17,176
我觉得我们的衬衫后面
And I thought the back of our t-shirt

330
00:14:17,178 --> 00:14:21,564
可以写上"奶油爆满"
could just say, "cream filled."

331
00:14:21,566 --> 00:14:24,850
如果如果一个性感妞穿着 会很有趣的
So funny if, like, a hot girl was wearing it.

332
00:14:24,852 --> 00:14:28,904
如果是个胖子穿着就更搞笑了
And even funnier if it was a fat guy.

333
00:14:28,906 --> 00:14:31,690
好吧 也许就像Gordon说的
Okay, maybe like Gordon said,

334
00:14:31,692 --> 00:14:34,527
我们的合作之船 驶向不同的地方了
our partner ships are going in different directions.

335
00:14:34,529 --> 00:14:36,362
我的"又甜又香"号驶向一边
My sugar and spice ship is going one way,

336
00:14:36,364 --> 00:14:38,080
而你的"尖酸刻薄"号
and your mean and ugly booze cruise

337
00:14:38,082 --> 00:14:39,782
驶向了另一边
is going another.

338
00:14:39,784 --> 00:14:42,368
要不明天这样 我开我的船
So how about tomorrow, I'll sail my ship,

339
00:14:42,370 --> 00:14:44,703
你开你的船 Ellen
and you can sail yours, Ellen.

340
00:14:44,705 --> 00:14:46,255
没问题
Done.

341
00:14:46,257 --> 00:14:48,374
对了 Pam 我知道你觉得自己的船不会沉
And, Pam, I know you think your ship don't sink,

342
00:14:48,376 --> 00:14:51,093
但它真的会沉
but it does.

343
00:14:59,634 --> 00:15:03,854
Hannah和Todd 开始吧
So, Hannah, Todd, go.

344
00:15:03,856 --> 00:15:07,308
告诉我们 你们的生意是什么?
Tell us, who is your business?

345
00:15:07,310 --> 00:15:10,978
我们做的是吉他包旅行包
We make guitar case suitcases.

346
00:15:10,980 --> 00:15:15,482
没错 那是外形像吉他包的旅行包
Yeah, they're suitcases that look like guitar cases

347
00:15:15,484 --> 00:15:19,036
这样你就可以在机场装酷
So you can look cool at the airport.

348
00:15:19,038 --> 00:15:20,871
目前为止 没有真理球
So far, no truth balls.

349
00:15:20,873 --> 00:15:23,123
这意味着大家相信你们所描述的生意理念
That means we believe you're telling some truth

350
00:15:23,125 --> 00:15:24,375
是有道理的
of who you are.

351
00:15:24,377 --> 00:15:26,877
做生意总是...
Business is always...

352
00:15:26,879 --> 00:15:28,128
好吧
Okay then.

353
00:15:28,130 --> 00:15:29,630
这有什么 他们的想法
So what, their big idea

354
00:15:29,632 --> 00:15:31,915
不就是把你的杂物都塞进一个吉他包里?
is just throwing your crap in a guitar case?

355
00:15:31,917 --> 00:15:34,802
起码不是"屁工"纸杯蛋糕
Well, it's no fart-isan cupcake.

356
00:15:34,804 --> 00:15:37,504
Todd和Hannah 你们有没有跟我们的艺术家一起
Todd, Hannah, did you get together with our graphic artist

357
00:15:37,506 --> 00:15:38,639
设计一个商标呢?
to help create a logo?

358
00:15:38,641 --> 00:15:40,174
有 我们设计出了
Yes, we did.

359
00:15:40,176 --> 00:15:42,559
我们花了整个通宵 说实话
We stayed up all night, and to be honest,

360
00:15:42,561 --> 00:15:46,180
商标有点奇怪
it got kind of weird.

361
00:15:46,182 --> 00:15:47,848
这就是我们的商标
That's our logo,

362
00:15:47,850 --> 00:15:52,436
我们公司就叫"我和乐队是一伙的"
And our company's called "I'm with the band."

363
00:15:54,856 --> 00:15:56,857
够了!
Back off!

364
00:15:56,859 --> 00:16:00,494
她刚从康复中心出来
She just got out of rehab.

365
00:16:00,496 --> 00:16:03,030
胆小鬼是做不成生意的
Business is not for the faint of heart

366
00:16:03,032 --> 00:16:06,200
瘾君子也不能做生意
or coke addicts.

367
00:16:06,202 --> 00:16:07,701
下一组 我们有请Ellen和Pam
Next up, we've got Ellen and Pam.

368
00:16:07,703 --> 00:16:09,620
给点儿掌声鼓励她们一下
Let's give 'em some love.

369
00:16:09,622 --> 00:16:11,088
Max 你真的不能到上面去
Max, you're really not gonna go up there

370
00:16:11,090 --> 00:16:12,706
把你的想法当做生意卖点
and sell your idea as a business plan.

371
00:16:12,708 --> 00:16:16,260
当然能 而且我的感觉很好
Yup, and I feel pretty good about it.

372
00:16:16,262 --> 00:16:18,379
好吧 希望你会希望被扔得
Okay, well, then I hope you enjoy lots of balls

373
00:16:18,381 --> 00:16:19,596
满脸蛋蛋
in your face.

374
00:16:19,598 --> 00:16:21,215
在火人节我都能安然度过
If I didn't at Burning Man,

375
00:16:21,217 --> 00:16:24,051
在这里我也能行
I doubt I will here.

376
00:16:24,053 --> 00:16:25,052
Gordon 嗨
Gordon, hi.

377
00:16:25,054 --> 00:16:25,909
就像你预测的那样
As you predicted,

378
00:16:25,909 --> 00:16:28,272
我们今天要分开展示我们的品牌
today we'll be presenting our brands separately.

379
00:16:28,274 --> 00:16:31,392
好的 看来今天有一个品牌要被淘汰了 伙计们
Okay, looks like we have us a brand off, folks.

380
00:16:31,394 --> 00:16:32,776
太刺激了
This is exciting.

381
00:16:32,778 --> 00:16:37,648
我都心花怒放了!
I am feeling it!

382
00:16:37,650 --> 00:16:39,566
Ellen 我知道你不太习惯孤单
Ellen, I know you're not used to being alone.

383
00:16:39,568 --> 00:16:43,287
我以前也不习惯 所以有了第三个老婆
Neither was I, hence wife number three.

384
00:16:43,289 --> 00:16:44,621
别着急
Don't rush.

385
00:16:44,623 --> 00:16:47,491
把大家的注意力拉回你自己身上
Take some time to get yourself centered.

386
00:16:47,493 --> 00:16:50,044
哟 哟 哟! 切克闹!
Yo, yo, yo! What's happening, Sheridan!

387
00:16:50,046 --> 00:16:51,378
美女Ellen驾到
Ellen in the house.

388
00:16:51,380 --> 00:16:53,747
热烈掌声响起来
Let me hear some noise.

389
00:16:53,749 --> 00:16:55,883
噢! 好啦 好啦 
Yeah. Oh! All right, all right.

390
00:16:55,885 --> 00:16:58,385
这里有几个喷子 但没关系
We got some haters. That's cool.

391
00:16:58,387 --> 00:17:00,304
Ellen 你设计商标了吗?
Ellen, did you design a logo?

392
00:17:00,306 --> 00:17:04,258
当然 给他们看看 放幻灯片的
Sure did. Show it, player.

393
00:17:04,260 --> 00:17:07,061
George 她在跟你说话呢
George, she's talking to you.

394
00:17:08,430 --> 00:17:10,064
噢 视觉效果还不错
Oh, good impact.

395
00:17:10,066 --> 00:17:11,732
砰 一看就知道是买蛋糕的
Boom, cupcake business.

396
00:17:11,734 --> 00:17:13,067
但是...
But, um...

397
00:17:13,069 --> 00:17:15,018
你店铺的名字在哪儿
Where's the name of your business.

398
00:17:15,020 --> 00:17:17,154
姐儿不需要
Oh, I didn't want one.

399
00:17:17,156 --> 00:17:19,823
姐儿就是要这种酷酷的感觉
I just wanted it to be cool.

400
00:17:21,609 --> 00:17:23,110
让我来解释一下
So let me get this correct.

401
00:17:23,112 --> 00:17:25,162
你想用T恤为你的生意宣传
You want to make T-shirts for your business

402
00:17:25,164 --> 00:17:27,114
但T恤和你的生意又没有关联
With no business connection.

403
00:17:27,116 --> 00:17:28,615
好吧
Okay.

404
00:17:28,617 --> 00:17:31,335
这是你的从商之路 但到这可能就结束了
This is your journey, but it might end here.

405
00:17:31,337 --> 00:17:34,204
不 不 不 看见没 上面是纸杯蛋糕
No, no, no, see, it's a cupcake,

406
00:17:34,206 --> 00:17:40,127
我们卖的是纸杯蛋糕 所以这是我们的"伤业"
and we sell cupcakes, so that's the "bidness."

407
00:17:40,129 --> 00:17:43,263
好吧 你猜怎么着? 老娘不干了!
Okay, you know what? Screw this!

408
00:17:43,265 --> 00:17:46,934
那件T恤酷毙了 如果你们体会不到
That t-shirt is way cool, and if you can't see it,

409
00:17:46,936 --> 00:17:52,139
这个培训根本不值我花一千块钱
this seminar is so not worth the $1,000 I paid.

410
00:17:52,141 --> 00:17:53,807
拜拜
Peace out.

411
00:17:56,929 --> 00:18:00,948
在生意圈儿里 我们管这个叫倒闭
In business, we call that a meltdown.

412
00:18:00,950 --> 00:18:02,866
时有发生
It happens.

413
00:18:02,868 --> 00:18:05,452
下面有请Ellen的前合伙人Pam
So why don't we bring up Ellen's former partner Pam.

414
00:18:05,454 --> 00:18:07,371
让我们热烈欢迎Pam
Let's give Pam a round of applause.

415
00:18:07,373 --> 00:18:09,289
Max 我没必要到上面去了
Max, I don't have to go up there.

416
00:18:09,291 --> 00:18:10,541
走吧 我们离开这
Come on, we can just leave.

417
00:18:10,543 --> 00:18:11,992
看看是谁
Oh, look who wants

418
00:18:11,994 --> 00:18:13,961
要卷起铺盖走人了
to pack up their guitar suitcase and go.

419
00:18:13,963 --> 00:18:15,329
你知道吗?
You know what?

420
00:18:15,331 --> 00:18:16,663
我想离开是因为你失败了
I was only leaving 'cause you failed.

421
00:18:16,665 --> 00:18:18,499
我对自己的点子很有信心
I believe in my ideas.

422
00:18:20,468 --> 00:18:22,636
大家下午好 
Good afternoon. Hello, hi.

423
00:18:22,638 --> 00:18:24,888
我是 Max自制纸杯蛋糕店的代表
I represent Max's homemade cupcakes.

424
00:18:24,890 --> 00:18:26,557
我要打断你一下
I'm gonna stop you right there.

425
00:18:26,559 --> 00:18:28,342
为什么是Max蛋糕店
Why Max's cupcakes?

426
00:18:28,344 --> 00:18:30,344
为什么不是Ellen或者Pam蛋糕店?
Why not Ellen's or Pam's?

427
00:18:30,346 --> 00:18:32,179
嗯...
Well, um...

428
00:18:32,181 --> 00:18:36,400
Max是... Max是一位很特别的人
Max was... Max is this very special person

429
00:18:36,402 --> 00:18:39,353
是她启发了我们做这个生意
and the inspiration behind our whole business.

430
00:18:39,355 --> 00:18:40,521
明白了
Got it.

431
00:18:40,523 --> 00:18:41,855
所以Max 是你和你生意的
So Max is an emotional touchstone

432
00:18:41,857 --> 00:18:43,323
感情纽带
for you and your business.

433
00:18:43,325 --> 00:18:45,025
是的
Yes.

434
00:18:45,027 --> 00:18:46,243
好理由 继续说
Valid. Go on.

435
00:18:46,245 --> 00:18:47,528
好的
Great.

436
00:18:47,530 --> 00:18:50,030
咱们看看商标...
So the logo...

437
00:18:50,032 --> 00:18:53,250
George 请
George.

438
00:18:53,252 --> 00:18:55,202
这是我们公司目前的商标
This is our current company logo,

439
00:18:55,204 --> 00:18:56,954
我感觉用它挺好的
and I feel it works just fine.

440
00:18:56,956 --> 00:19:00,374
只要它没烂没破 就用不着理了 对吧?
I mean, if it ain't broke, don't fix it, right?

441
00:19:00,376 --> 00:19:02,676
行啦
Okay.

442
00:19:02,678 --> 00:19:06,013
我们的纸杯蛋糕是甜蜜的象征
Well, the cupcake shows a mix of sweet imagery

443
00:19:06,015 --> 00:19:09,433
因为我们两个女孩一直想让
Because we're two girls trying to retro-repurpose the phrase

444
00:19:09,435 --> 00:19:13,387
"香香甜甜 美好无限"这句话再火一把
"sugar and spice and everything nice."

445
00:19:13,389 --> 00:19:15,189
嘿 嘿! 嘿 嘿 嘿 嘿 嘿!
Hey, hey! Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey!

446
00:19:15,191 --> 00:19:16,640
别扔了!
Leave Pam alone!

447
00:19:16,642 --> 00:19:18,225
我没事 Ellen
I'm fine, Ellen.

448
00:19:18,227 --> 00:19:19,943
他们打不倒我 因为我对我们
They can't shut me down, because I believe in us

449
00:19:19,945 --> 00:19:22,229
以及我们精美的手工纸杯蛋糕有信心
and our special brand of artisan cupcakes.

450
00:19:22,231 --> 00:19:24,648
为什么?
Why?

451
00:19:31,739 --> 00:19:32,956
话筒给我!
Give me!

452
00:19:32,958 --> 00:19:36,577
去死吧 你们这群潘 去死 去死!
Eat it, you losers! Eat it, eat it!

453
00:19:36,579 --> 00:19:39,630
我发现没人朝你们扔真理球了
I see the truth balls have stopped.

454
00:19:39,632 --> 00:19:43,217
看来"去死 去死 潘棵"
It looks like "eat it, eat it, you losers."

455
00:19:43,219 --> 00:19:47,421
可以做你们的品牌
might just be your brand.

456
00:19:47,423 --> 00:19:50,924
你们两个就是一个香甜组合
You two are a combination of sugar and spice

457
00:19:50,926 --> 00:19:53,093
但是世事并不美好
and things not so nice.

458
00:19:53,095 --> 00:19:56,930
说到真相 你们要把培训的钱补交给Sandra
Speaking of truth, I need you to pay Sandra for the seminar.

459
00:19:56,932 --> 00:19:58,982
我十分敬佩你们的勇气
As much as I admire your pluck,

460
00:19:58,984 --> 00:20:02,686
但是你们吃了十二次的意大利面不是免费
12 trips to the pasta bar aren't free.

461
00:20:02,688 --> 00:20:04,655
- 走吧 Pam   - 好的 我们走 Ellen
- Come on, Pam.  - Yeah, let's go, Ellen.

462
00:20:04,657 --> 00:20:06,106
我就是Ellen
I'm Ellen.

463
00:20:13,164 --> 00:20:15,198
猜猜我大衣里面是什么
Guess what I have under my coat.

464
00:20:15,200 --> 00:20:18,452
反正你不会去做缩胸手术
Well, I know it's not a boob reduction.

465
00:20:18,454 --> 00:20:20,254
你觉得怎么样? 很酷 是吧?
What do you think? Cool, huh?

466
00:20:20,256 --> 00:20:22,339
噢 该死的 已经有人做这种T恤了?
Aw, man, somebody already makes that?

467
00:20:22,341 --> 00:20:23,957
太遗憾了
Oh, bummer.

468
00:20:23,959 --> 00:20:26,627
就像以前我以为是自己发明了土豆条三明治
This is like when I thought I invented chip-wiches.

469
00:20:26,629 --> 00:20:29,296
其实早该知道的 我以前都吃过一次了
Should've known. I was eating one at the time.

470
00:20:29,298 --> 00:20:31,348
不 Max 这是你发明的T恤
No, Max, this is your shirt.

471
00:20:31,350 --> 00:20:32,966
我在研讨会上拿到了你的设计
I got the rendering from the seminar

472
00:20:32,968 --> 00:20:34,268
然后把它做了出来
and had it made it

473
00:20:34,270 --> 00:20:36,470
我们在"快又好"可以做任何东西
We can make anything in "Under An Hour."

474
00:20:36,472 --> 00:20:38,105
你知道的 就在你被捕的那座桥下面
You know, that place under the bridge

475
00:20:38,107 --> 00:20:41,441
那间未成年酒吧的旁边
near the underage bar where you got under arrest.

476
00:20:41,443 --> 00:20:42,976
不会吧
No way.

477
00:20:42,978 --> 00:20:44,645
真不敢相信 太性感了 
Oh, no way. That's hot.

478
00:20:44,647 --> 00:20:46,647
我知道 那地方还有个女孩子
I know, and a girl at the place

479
00:20:46,649 --> 00:20:48,448
还问我在哪儿能买到呢
asked me where she could get one.

480
00:20:48,450 --> 00:20:49,700
真的吗?
Really?

481
00:20:49,702 --> 00:20:53,120
我都有点儿爱上我自己了
Kind of in love with myself right now.

482
00:20:53,122 --> 00:20:55,155
嘿 是什么让你改变了对那个T恤的看法?
Hey, what made you change your mind about the T-shirts?

483
00:20:55,157 --> 00:20:56,790
我在沃顿商学院学到的一件事就是
Well, one of the things I learned at wharton

484
00:20:56,792 --> 00:20:58,959
成功取决于要听取更好的创意
is that success depends on staying open

485
00:20:58,961 --> 00:21:01,378
即使这创意不是你想出来的
to a better idea, even if it's not yours.

486
00:21:01,380 --> 00:21:03,497
对了 你也有一件
Aw. And here.

487
00:21:03,499 --> 00:21:05,499
我觉得你应该喜欢黑色的
I thought you'd rather a black one.

488
00:21:05,501 --> 00:21:09,803
在约炮软件和生活中都适用
On Tinder and in life.
