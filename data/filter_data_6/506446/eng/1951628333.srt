1
00:02:36,198 --> 00:02:40,035
Countess of Morcar's,
thanks.

2
00:02:42,329 --> 00:02:44,081
My God,
she's back.

3
00:02:48,710 --> 00:02:51,213
She's getting out
of the carriage.

4
00:02:51,296 --> 00:02:53,632
Come on, Ryder,
get a move on.

5
00:02:59,221 --> 00:03:00,806
...look lively.

6
00:03:00,889 --> 00:03:01,723
All right.

7
00:03:01,807 --> 00:03:02,683
Get moving.

8
00:03:02,766 --> 00:03:03,684
All right.

9
00:03:03,767 --> 00:03:05,227
Her ladyship won't want
workmen under her feet.

10
00:03:05,352 --> 00:03:06,687
All right, I finished,
don't worry,

11
00:03:06,770 --> 00:03:08,313
quick job,
like you said.

12
00:03:18,907 --> 00:03:22,202
Oh, yeah,
yeah, nice, nice.

13
00:03:25,581 --> 00:03:27,416
Countess, eh?

14
00:03:27,499 --> 00:03:29,501
Have to get by
appointment only...

15
00:03:29,585 --> 00:03:31,003
Come on, lad,
out.

16
00:03:50,272 --> 00:03:51,857
All right.

17
00:04:31,480 --> 00:04:33,482
Over there
will do.

18
00:04:42,199 --> 00:04:45,077
Here, for the
three of you.

19
00:04:45,160 --> 00:04:46,870
Thank you,
milady,

20
00:04:46,995 --> 00:04:48,914
and a Merry Christmas,
milady.

21
00:04:54,837 --> 00:04:56,296
Ring for tea,
Cusack.

22
00:04:56,380 --> 00:04:57,965
Yes, milady.

23
00:04:58,090 --> 00:05:00,634
I need something
to sustain me.

24
00:05:00,717 --> 00:05:04,429
I do find preparing for
Christmas quite an ordeal.

25
00:05:04,513 --> 00:05:06,640
Yes, milady.

26
00:05:06,723 --> 00:05:12,312
And then,
a bath, I think.

27
00:05:51,685 --> 00:05:53,187
Milady.

28
00:05:53,312 --> 00:05:57,357
The blue carbuncle,

29
00:05:57,482 --> 00:06:05,199
the blue carbuncle,
it's stolen.

30
00:06:15,167 --> 00:06:18,295
Open them up,
there.

31
00:06:18,420 --> 00:06:24,176
Oh, John, she'll love it,
it is beautiful.

32
00:06:24,259 --> 00:06:26,595
Just like
her mother.

33
00:06:26,720 --> 00:06:29,348
But can we
afford it, though?

34
00:06:29,431 --> 00:06:32,935
I told you, I made a nice
little bob or two lately.

35
00:06:33,060 --> 00:06:36,772
Even if I hadn't,
it's Christmas.

36
00:06:36,897 --> 00:06:39,066
You're a good man,
John Horner.

37
00:06:39,149 --> 00:06:40,692
I'm a
lucky man,

38
00:06:40,776 --> 00:06:43,278
a wife and kids
like I've got,

39
00:06:43,403 --> 00:06:45,572
means as good
as a king.

40
00:06:45,656 --> 00:06:48,784
So, it's the doll
for the girl,

41
00:06:48,909 --> 00:06:51,245
and the boat
for the boy, right?

42
00:06:51,328 --> 00:06:53,205
Right.

43
00:06:53,288 --> 00:06:57,960
Spending the loot already,
are we, Horner?

44
00:06:58,085 --> 00:06:59,837
What do
you mean?

45
00:06:59,962 --> 00:07:01,421
I've done nothing,
what do you mean?

46
00:07:01,547 --> 00:07:03,215
John Frederick
Horner,

47
00:07:03,298 --> 00:07:05,217
I hereby arrest you on
the charge of stealing

48
00:07:05,300 --> 00:07:08,595
the valuable gem known
as the blue carbuncle,

49
00:07:08,679 --> 00:07:10,973
the property of
the Countess of Morcar.

50
00:07:11,056 --> 00:07:12,224
Anything you say...

51
00:07:12,307 --> 00:07:14,059
I didn't do it, I tell you,
I didn't do it.

52
00:07:14,142 --> 00:07:16,562
...the men at
the hotel gave

53
00:07:16,645 --> 00:07:18,856
a very good
description of you.

54
00:07:18,981 --> 00:07:19,773
Constable,

55
00:07:19,857 --> 00:07:22,150
I didn't do it,
I tell you,

56
00:07:22,276 --> 00:07:24,152
let me go, will you,
I didn't do it.

57
00:07:25,571 --> 00:07:26,530
Oh.

58
00:08:24,755 --> 00:08:26,632
Mr. Holmes?

59
00:08:31,720 --> 00:08:33,722
Mr. Holmes?

60
00:08:33,805 --> 00:08:36,850
Mr. Peterson, the
commissionaire from Upasit...

61
00:08:36,975 --> 00:08:39,186
Oh, please,
go away.

62
00:08:39,311 --> 00:08:40,562
...he'd like
a word with you.

63
00:08:40,687 --> 00:08:41,939
Oh.

64
00:09:01,458 --> 00:09:04,336
I'm sorry to disturb you,
Mr. Holmes.

65
00:09:04,419 --> 00:09:17,558
Peterson, put down your goose,
and your, your hat.

66
00:09:17,683 --> 00:09:19,226
It's a fine
purchase,

67
00:09:19,309 --> 00:09:22,563
I myself favor a goose
for Christmas dinner.

68
00:09:22,646 --> 00:09:24,940
Well, that's
part of the problem,

69
00:09:25,065 --> 00:09:28,235
Mr. Holmes, the bird
is not mine.

70
00:09:28,360 --> 00:09:31,280
You might say,
I come by it.

71
00:09:31,363 --> 00:09:36,076
Oh,
"for Mrs. Henry Baker,"

72
00:09:36,159 --> 00:09:37,995
and obviously,
not your hat.

73
00:09:38,120 --> 00:09:39,079
No, sir.

74
00:09:39,204 --> 00:09:40,622
Well, there were
peculiar circumstances,

75
00:09:40,706 --> 00:09:42,499
and I didn't know what
to do for the best.

76
00:09:42,624 --> 00:09:44,835
It hardly seemed a matter
for the police.

77
00:09:44,960 --> 00:09:46,587
So I talked to
the wife about it,

78
00:09:46,670 --> 00:09:48,463
and she suggested
I come and see you.

79
00:09:48,589 --> 00:09:50,591
The wise
Mrs. Peterson.

80
00:09:50,716 --> 00:09:52,426
Sit down,
my dear fellow,

81
00:09:52,551 --> 00:09:54,845
and describe these peculiar
circumstances to me.

82
00:09:54,970 --> 00:09:59,308
Well, sir,
it was like this.

83
00:09:59,433 --> 00:10:01,977
Last night I was on my
way home from a little,

84
00:10:02,102 --> 00:10:04,313
uh, celebration.

85
00:10:04,438 --> 00:10:06,190
Well, at this time
of the year

86
00:10:06,315 --> 00:10:08,025
some of us commissionairs
meet to -

87
00:10:08,150 --> 00:10:10,485
To wish each other
the season's greetings.

88
00:10:10,569 --> 00:10:11,653
Exactly.

89
00:10:11,778 --> 00:10:13,655
The season's
greetings.

90
00:10:13,780 --> 00:10:16,283
Oh, you're a top,
sir.

91
00:10:16,408 --> 00:10:19,494
Your good health,
sir.

92
00:10:19,620 --> 00:10:25,626
Well, as I was saying,
I was on my way home

93
00:10:25,751 --> 00:10:29,379
when I came across what you
would only describe as a frakel.

94
00:11:11,839 --> 00:11:15,300
Oy,
what's happening?

95
00:11:15,384 --> 00:11:17,970
Blimey, it's a
copper,...

96
00:11:18,053 --> 00:11:19,721
get out of here.

97
00:11:22,558 --> 00:11:24,351
get out of here.

98
00:11:28,438 --> 00:11:30,899
I'm trying
to help you, man.

99
00:11:37,406 --> 00:11:39,366
Well, the roughs ran
off in one direction,

100
00:11:39,491 --> 00:11:41,577
and the drunk fellow
ran off in the other.

101
00:11:41,702 --> 00:11:43,662
I tried to stop him,
but he no doubt thought

102
00:11:43,745 --> 00:11:45,539
I was a constable about
to apprehend him

103
00:11:45,622 --> 00:11:47,416
for the breaking
of the window.

104
00:11:47,541 --> 00:11:49,585
And so you left with
the spoils of victory

105
00:11:49,710 --> 00:11:51,253
in the shape
of that battered hat,

106
00:11:51,378 --> 00:11:53,255
and a most unimpeachable
Christmas goose.

107
00:11:53,338 --> 00:11:55,257
Both of which
I would willingly

108
00:11:55,382 --> 00:11:56,884
have returned to their
rightful owners, Mr. Holmes,

109
00:11:57,009 --> 00:12:00,179
but the truth is,
I didn't know how.

110
00:12:00,262 --> 00:12:04,099
My dear Peterson,
I do see your problem.

111
00:12:04,224 --> 00:12:06,226
Anyway,
as I say,

112
00:12:06,351 --> 00:12:08,437
I discussed the matter
with the good lady,

113
00:12:08,562 --> 00:12:10,189
and we decided that
I would bring both

114
00:12:10,272 --> 00:12:13,358
the goose and the hat
to you, Mr. Holmes,

115
00:12:13,442 --> 00:12:16,403
seeing as how even the slightest
of problems is of interest

116
00:12:16,486 --> 00:12:21,617
to you in your particular
line of occupation.

117
00:12:21,742 --> 00:12:27,706
I hope you don't think I'm
wasting your time, Mr. Holmes.

118
00:12:27,789 --> 00:12:31,126
Not in
the least.

119
00:12:31,251 --> 00:12:32,544
Now then,
Commissionaire,

120
00:12:32,628 --> 00:12:35,339
have you purchased
your own bird?

121
00:12:35,464 --> 00:12:36,423
No,
not yet.

122
00:12:36,548 --> 00:12:39,384
Then I suggest that you carry
off this goose so that it

123
00:12:39,468 --> 00:12:43,222
may fulfill its
ultimate destiny,

124
00:12:43,305 --> 00:12:45,516
while I retain the battered
hat of the unknown gentleman

125
00:12:45,641 --> 00:12:47,267
who has lost his
Christmas dinner.

126
00:12:47,351 --> 00:12:49,019
Well, if you think
I should, Mr. Holmes.

127
00:12:49,144 --> 00:12:50,938
I do,
indeed.

128
00:12:51,021 --> 00:12:53,524
For there are signs,
in spite of the frost,

129
00:12:53,649 --> 00:12:54,775
that this bird
should be prepared

130
00:12:54,858 --> 00:12:57,528
without unnecessary
delay.

131
00:12:57,653 --> 00:12:59,279
Well, if that's
all right, Mr. Holmes.

132
00:12:59,404 --> 00:13:00,614
I will of course,

133
00:13:00,739 --> 00:13:02,908
keep you in touch
with the developments.

134
00:13:02,991 --> 00:13:04,409
Very good,
sir.

135
00:13:04,493 --> 00:13:07,621
Oh, uh, may I wish you
the complements of the season.

136
00:13:07,704 --> 00:13:09,706
And to you and your
good wife.

137
00:13:23,428 --> 00:13:27,266
But you still haven't
found the jewel.

138
00:13:27,349 --> 00:13:29,810
Not yet,
no, milady,

139
00:13:29,893 --> 00:13:32,145
but we do have
the man, Horner.

140
00:13:32,229 --> 00:13:34,857
Or have a clue
as to its whereabouts.

141
00:13:34,982 --> 00:13:36,859
And I think we may
assume that

142
00:13:36,984 --> 00:13:40,320
he had one accomplice,
if not more.

143
00:13:40,404 --> 00:13:42,364
Well,
what of that?

144
00:13:42,489 --> 00:13:45,200
Contrary to popular
fiction, milady,

145
00:13:45,325 --> 00:13:47,953
there is very little
honor amongst thieves,

146
00:13:48,036 --> 00:13:51,331
and even less with
the right inducement.

147
00:13:51,415 --> 00:13:55,627
Inducement,
do you mean a reward?

148
00:13:55,711 --> 00:13:58,672
Uh, yes.

149
00:13:58,755 --> 00:14:02,342
Why should I offer
a reward?

150
00:14:02,467 --> 00:14:06,180
In my experience,
and it is considerable,

151
00:14:06,305 --> 00:14:09,057
I have found that
the offer of a reward

152
00:14:09,183 --> 00:14:13,187
would very soon set the greedy
cat amongst the criminal pigeon.

153
00:14:13,270 --> 00:14:15,522
Well?

154
00:14:15,647 --> 00:14:17,524
I should be
very surprised

155
00:14:17,608 --> 00:14:21,278
if I did not gain a result
within 24 hours.

156
00:14:25,782 --> 00:14:27,534
How much?

157
00:14:28,619 --> 00:14:30,078
Holmes?

158
00:14:30,204 --> 00:14:32,122
Oh,
you're up.

159
00:14:32,247 --> 00:14:34,875
The Countess of Morcar
is offering a thousand pounds

160
00:14:34,958 --> 00:14:37,836
for the return
of the blue carbuncle.

161
00:14:37,920 --> 00:14:39,463
Inspector Bradstreet
of B Division

162
00:14:39,588 --> 00:14:41,423
is in charge
of the case,

163
00:14:41,548 --> 00:14:43,467
and has arrested
Mr. John Horner,

164
00:14:43,592 --> 00:14:45,844
a plumber,
age 36,

165
00:14:45,928 --> 00:14:49,139
who protested his innocence
in the strongest terms.

166
00:14:49,264 --> 00:14:51,850
Circumstantial evidence
was so strong that the case

167
00:14:51,934 --> 00:14:54,603
has been referred
to the Assizes.

168
00:14:54,728 --> 00:14:58,690
Horner, who showed signs
of intense emotion

169
00:14:58,774 --> 00:15:01,652
during the proceedings,
faded away at the conclusion

170
00:15:01,777 --> 00:15:05,113
and was carried
from the court.

171
00:15:05,197 --> 00:15:08,408
Oh, excuse me,
you are engaged.

172
00:15:08,492 --> 00:15:12,538
I am interrupting your
study of that hat.

173
00:15:12,621 --> 00:15:18,085
No, no, no, the matter
is a perfectly trivial one.

174
00:15:18,210 --> 00:15:20,379
But there are points
in connection with it

175
00:15:20,462 --> 00:15:25,300
which are not devoid
of interest,

176
00:15:25,384 --> 00:15:27,761
even of instruction.

177
00:15:27,845 --> 00:15:29,972
I suppose that homely
as it looks,

178
00:15:30,097 --> 00:15:33,058
that thing has some deadly
story linked to it that

179
00:15:33,141 --> 00:15:36,353
is the clue which will guide you
in the solution of some mystery

180
00:15:36,478 --> 00:15:39,273
and the punishment
of some crime.

181
00:15:39,356 --> 00:15:43,443
No, no,
no, no,

182
00:15:43,569 --> 00:15:46,530
it is just one of those
whimsical little instance

183
00:15:46,655 --> 00:15:49,116
that will occur when you
have four million people

184
00:15:49,116 --> 00:15:53,120
jostling each other within the
space of a few square miles.

185
00:15:53,203 --> 00:15:58,000
So, what do you gather
from that battered old felt?

186
00:15:58,083 --> 00:16:00,419
You know
my methods.

187
00:16:00,502 --> 00:16:03,839
What do you yourself
gather as to the individuality

188
00:16:03,964 --> 00:16:08,135
of the man who has worn
this particular article?

189
00:16:11,221 --> 00:16:15,392
It was accompanied
by a goose, Watson.

190
00:16:15,517 --> 00:16:17,853
"For Mrs. Henry Baker,"
was printed upon a small card

191
00:16:17,936 --> 00:16:20,689
attached to the bird's
left leg.

192
00:16:26,361 --> 00:16:28,113
Well, apart from
the initials inside,

193
00:16:28,197 --> 00:16:31,783
H.B.,
presumably Henry Baker...

194
00:16:34,203 --> 00:16:37,164
...I can
see nothing.

195
00:16:37,247 --> 00:16:40,501
On the contrary, Watson,
you can see everything,

196
00:16:40,584 --> 00:16:42,377
but you fail to reason
for what you see.

197
00:16:42,503 --> 00:16:45,756
You are too timid in drawing
your inferences.

198
00:16:45,881 --> 00:16:47,758
Then, pray,

199
00:16:47,883 --> 00:16:52,554
tell me what it is that you
can infer from that hat?

200
00:16:52,679 --> 00:16:56,725
That the man
is highly intellectual

201
00:16:56,850 --> 00:16:59,186
is, of course,
obvious.

202
00:16:59,269 --> 00:17:01,355
And also that he was
fairly well-to-do

203
00:17:01,438 --> 00:17:03,398
within the past
three years,

204
00:17:03,524 --> 00:17:05,692
although now he has
fallen upon evil days.

205
00:17:05,776 --> 00:17:08,862
He had foresight,
but less now than formerly,

206
00:17:08,987 --> 00:17:12,407
pointing to a moral
retrogression,

207
00:17:12,491 --> 00:17:15,244
which, when taken with the
decline of his fortunes,

208
00:17:15,369 --> 00:17:22,751
seems to indicate an evil
influence, probably drink.

209
00:17:22,835 --> 00:17:25,087
This may account also
for the fact that his wife

210
00:17:25,212 --> 00:17:27,589
has ceased
to love him.

211
00:17:27,673 --> 00:17:29,550
My dear, Holmes.

212
00:17:29,633 --> 00:17:33,428
He has, however, retained
some degree of self-respect,

213
00:17:33,554 --> 00:17:36,139
and now he leads
a sedentary life,

214
00:17:36,265 --> 00:17:38,559
is out of training
entirely.

215
00:17:38,642 --> 00:17:40,853
He's middle-aged,
has grizzled hair

216
00:17:40,936 --> 00:17:45,107
which he has had cut within
the last few days,

217
00:17:45,232 --> 00:17:47,818
and which he anoints
with lime-cream.

218
00:17:47,943 --> 00:17:52,030
It is also highly improbable
that he has gas

219
00:17:52,114 --> 00:17:54,658
laid on in
his house.

220
00:17:54,783 --> 00:17:59,454
Well, now you are
certainly joking.

221
00:17:59,580 --> 00:18:02,249
Not in
the least.

222
00:18:02,374 --> 00:18:05,961
Well, I have no doubt
that I am very stupid.

223
00:18:06,086 --> 00:18:10,299
For example, how do you deduce
that the man is intellectual?

224
00:18:10,424 --> 00:18:12,968
It is a question
of cubic capacity.

225
00:18:15,095 --> 00:18:20,058
A man with so large a head
must have something in it.

226
00:18:20,142 --> 00:18:25,147
Well, the decline
in his fortunes, then?

227
00:18:25,272 --> 00:18:28,358
These flat brims
with the curled edges

228
00:18:28,483 --> 00:18:29,902
came in three
years ago.

229
00:18:29,985 --> 00:18:33,530
It is a hat of the very
best quality, Watson.

230
00:18:33,655 --> 00:18:37,409
Look at the band of ribbed
silk and the excellent lining.

231
00:18:37,493 --> 00:18:40,954
If this man could afford
so expensive a hat

232
00:18:41,038 --> 00:18:43,081
three years ago,
and has had no hat since,

233
00:18:43,165 --> 00:18:45,876
then he has assuredly
gone down in the world.

234
00:18:46,001 --> 00:18:49,838
What about the foresight
and the moral retrogression?

235
00:18:49,922 --> 00:18:51,298
Ah, here is
the foresight,

236
00:18:51,381 --> 00:18:55,177
these securers are
never sold upon hats.

237
00:18:55,260 --> 00:18:57,054
If this man
ordered one,

238
00:18:57,179 --> 00:18:58,889
it is a sign of a certain
amount of foresight,

239
00:18:59,014 --> 00:19:00,641
since he went
out of his way

240
00:19:00,766 --> 00:19:02,392
to take precaution
against the wind.

241
00:19:02,518 --> 00:19:05,020
But as you see that he
has broken the elastic

242
00:19:05,145 --> 00:19:07,397
and has not troubled
to replace it,

243
00:19:07,523 --> 00:19:09,775
a weakening
nature.

244
00:19:09,858 --> 00:19:11,235
Mmm.

245
00:19:11,360 --> 00:19:12,986
The further points,
that he is middle-aged,

246
00:19:13,111 --> 00:19:15,864
that his hair is grizzled,
that it has been cut recently,

247
00:19:15,989 --> 00:19:17,241
and that he anoints
it with lime-cream,

248
00:19:17,366 --> 00:19:18,575
can all to be gathered
by an inspection

249
00:19:18,700 --> 00:19:20,369
of the lower part
of the lining, Watson.

250
00:19:20,494 --> 00:19:24,706
Witness the moisture,
obviously a free perspirer,

251
00:19:24,832 --> 00:19:27,459
therefore, not
in the best of training.

252
00:19:27,543 --> 00:19:30,963
But his -
his wife,

253
00:19:31,046 --> 00:19:34,466
you said she had
ceased to love him.

254
00:19:34,550 --> 00:19:36,718
This hat has not been
brushed for weeks.

255
00:19:36,844 --> 00:19:38,846
When I see a man

256
00:19:38,929 --> 00:19:41,098
with a week's accumulation
of dust upon his hat,

257
00:19:41,223 --> 00:19:44,476
and his wife has allowed him
to go out in such a state,

258
00:19:44,560 --> 00:19:46,061
I fear that he has been
unfortunate enough

259
00:19:46,186 --> 00:19:48,355
to lose his wife's
affections.

260
00:19:48,480 --> 00:19:50,023
He might be
a bachelor.

261
00:19:50,148 --> 00:19:53,485
Nay, but he brought a goose
as a peace offering to his wife.

262
00:19:53,569 --> 00:19:56,363
Remember the card
attached to the bird's leg.

263
00:19:56,446 --> 00:20:01,201
Yes, well, you have an answer
to everything.

264
00:20:01,326 --> 00:20:04,288
Just a minute,
just a minute,

265
00:20:04,413 --> 00:20:11,336
how do you deduce that there is
no gas laid on in his house?

266
00:20:11,420 --> 00:20:14,882
One tallow
candle stain,

267
00:20:15,007 --> 00:20:16,341
or even two, might
come by chance;

268
00:20:16,425 --> 00:20:19,303
but when I see, Watson,
no less than five,

269
00:20:19,428 --> 00:20:23,390
he never got candle
stains from a gas jet, Watson.

270
00:20:23,515 --> 00:20:26,852
Are you
satisfied?

271
00:20:26,935 --> 00:20:28,353
Well, it's
all very ingenious.

272
00:20:28,562 --> 00:20:32,858
Mr. Holmes, the goose,
the goose, Mr. Holmes.

273
00:20:32,941 --> 00:20:34,067
Well, what of it, man,
has it come back to life

274
00:20:34,193 --> 00:20:37,112
and flapped off through
the kitchen window?

275
00:20:37,237 --> 00:20:39,406
No, no sir, no sir,
but see,

276
00:20:39,489 --> 00:20:43,785
see what the wife
found in its crop.

277
00:20:47,956 --> 00:20:52,503
By Jove, Peterson, this is
a treasure-trove indeed.

278
00:20:52,628 --> 00:20:54,421
You know what
you've got?

279
00:20:54,505 --> 00:20:56,256
A diamond,
a precious stone.

280
00:20:56,340 --> 00:20:58,425
It cuts glass
like it was putty.

281
00:20:58,509 --> 00:21:02,930
It is more than
a precious stone.

282
00:21:03,013 --> 00:21:06,266
It is the
precious stone.

283
00:21:06,391 --> 00:21:08,435
The Hotel
Cosmopolitan robbery,

284
00:21:08,519 --> 00:21:11,230
the blue
carbuncle.

285
00:21:11,313 --> 00:21:16,443
The blue carbuncle,
indeed.

286
00:21:26,995 --> 00:21:29,373
It is absolutely
unique,

287
00:21:29,498 --> 00:21:31,250
its value can only
be conjectured.

288
00:21:31,333 --> 00:21:33,043
And your reward,
Peterson,

289
00:21:33,168 --> 00:21:35,128
of 1000 pounds is not
within a twentieth

290
00:21:35,254 --> 00:21:36,880
of its
market price.

291
00:21:37,005 --> 00:21:40,175
A thousand pounds, oh,
Lord have mercy.

292
00:21:40,300 --> 00:21:42,177
You must admit,
Watson,

293
00:21:42,261 --> 00:21:45,097
that my deductions in
regard to this hat

294
00:21:45,180 --> 00:21:47,516
have suddenly assumed
a more important aspect.

295
00:21:47,599 --> 00:21:49,476
Yes, point taken,
Holmes.

296
00:21:49,476 --> 00:21:51,520
Now, the question for us
now to solve is to trace

297
00:21:51,645 --> 00:21:55,148
the sequence of events from a
rifled jewel case at one end,

298
00:21:55,232 --> 00:21:58,110
to the crop
of a goose at the other.

299
00:21:58,193 --> 00:22:01,572
There is
the stone.

300
00:22:01,697 --> 00:22:03,156
The stone came
from the goose,

301
00:22:03,240 --> 00:22:06,702
the goose came from
Mr. Henry Baker,

302
00:22:06,827 --> 00:22:07,828
the gentleman with
the shabby hat

303
00:22:07,953 --> 00:22:09,538
and all the other
characteristics.

304
00:22:09,663 --> 00:22:12,666
So, now, we must set
ourselves very seriously

305
00:22:12,791 --> 00:22:15,085
to finding this
gentleman,

306
00:22:15,210 --> 00:22:17,838
and to ascertaining what
part he had to play

307
00:22:17,963 --> 00:22:19,715
in this little
mystery.

308
00:22:19,840 --> 00:22:22,384
Found at the corner
of Goodge Street,

309
00:22:22,509 --> 00:22:24,511
a goose and
a black felt hat.

310
00:22:24,636 --> 00:22:27,472
Mr. Henry Baker can have same by
applying at 6:30 this evening

311
00:22:27,556 --> 00:22:32,311
at 221B, Baker Street,
clear and concise.

312
00:22:32,394 --> 00:22:34,479
Yes, very,
but will he see it?

313
00:22:34,563 --> 00:22:36,732
Well, I'm sure he will keep
an eye on the evening papers,

314
00:22:36,857 --> 00:22:39,776
for the poor man,
the loss was a heavy one.

315
00:22:39,902 --> 00:22:42,070
Oh, Peterson, uh, just nip down
to the advertising agency

316
00:22:42,196 --> 00:22:45,199
and have this put in
all the evening papers.

317
00:22:45,324 --> 00:22:46,408
Which, one,
sir?

318
00:22:46,533 --> 00:22:48,243
The Globe, Star, Pall Mall,
St. James's Bissett, Echo,

319
00:22:48,368 --> 00:22:49,244
Evening News,
Standard,

320
00:22:49,328 --> 00:22:52,247
and all the others
that may occur to you.

321
00:22:52,331 --> 00:22:53,415
Right away,
sir.

322
00:22:53,540 --> 00:22:55,250
And
the stone?

323
00:22:55,375 --> 00:22:58,879
I shall keep
the stone.

324
00:22:58,962 --> 00:23:00,422
Thank you,
Peterson.

325
00:23:00,506 --> 00:23:01,924
Yes, sir.

326
00:23:02,049 --> 00:23:04,218
Oh, and Peterson,

327
00:23:04,301 --> 00:23:06,970
uh, would you pick up
a goose on your way back?

328
00:23:07,095 --> 00:23:08,639
Give him the money,
will you, Watson.

329
00:23:08,764 --> 00:23:11,016
We must have something
to give Mr. Henry Baker

330
00:23:11,099 --> 00:23:12,893
to take the place
of the one

331
00:23:13,018 --> 00:23:15,437
which your family will
very soon be devouring.

332
00:23:15,521 --> 00:23:16,813
Oh, thank you,
sir.

333
00:23:16,939 --> 00:23:18,565
A thousand
pounds?

334
00:23:18,649 --> 00:23:20,609
A thousand
pounds.

335
00:23:20,734 --> 00:23:25,197
A thousand pounds,
a thousand pounds.

336
00:23:25,280 --> 00:23:33,747
Um, what, uh, will you
do with the stone?

337
00:23:33,831 --> 00:23:39,294
I shall keep it
in my museum.

338
00:23:55,978 --> 00:24:00,482
Well, Horner,

339
00:24:00,607 --> 00:24:04,278
Her Ladyship is not
at all pleased with me.

340
00:24:04,361 --> 00:24:06,238
You might be under
lock and key,

341
00:24:06,321 --> 00:24:08,323
but she'd rather her
blue carbuncle was.

342
00:24:08,407 --> 00:24:10,200
Never took it
Inspector...

343
00:24:10,325 --> 00:24:12,119
Well -

344
00:24:12,244 --> 00:24:14,955
Tell me what you did
with it, and, uh,

345
00:24:15,080 --> 00:24:17,416
I'll put in a good
word at your trial.

346
00:24:17,499 --> 00:24:18,959
But, if you don't -

347
00:24:19,042 --> 00:24:21,128
I've been on
the straight for years,

348
00:24:21,253 --> 00:24:23,046
ever since
I married Jenny.

349
00:24:23,172 --> 00:24:24,965
If you don't,

350
00:24:25,048 --> 00:24:26,884
and when the judge hears
about your previous conviction,

351
00:24:27,009 --> 00:24:33,056
you might never see your
pretty wife again.

352
00:24:33,182 --> 00:24:38,854
I've got you, Horner,
but I need that jewel.

353
00:24:43,400 --> 00:24:46,737
It's a bonny
thing,

354
00:24:46,862 --> 00:24:51,325
just see how it
glints and sparkles.

355
00:24:51,408 --> 00:24:54,161
Of course, it is a nucleus
and focus of crime,

356
00:24:54,244 --> 00:24:55,704
every good
stone is.

357
00:24:55,829 --> 00:24:58,332
They are the devil's
pet baits.

358
00:24:58,415 --> 00:25:01,460
In the larger
and older jewels

359
00:25:01,543 --> 00:25:05,005
every facet may stand
for a bloody deed.

360
00:25:05,130 --> 00:25:11,553
It was found in the banks of the
Amoy River in southern China,

361
00:25:11,637 --> 00:25:15,849
and is remarkable in having
every characteristic of the carbuncle,

362
00:25:15,974 --> 00:25:19,436
save that it is blue
instead of ruby red.

363
00:25:19,561 --> 00:25:24,024
This stone is not yet
twenty years old.

364
00:25:24,107 --> 00:25:25,943
Mmm.

365
00:25:26,068 --> 00:25:28,111
In spite
of its youth,

366
00:25:28,237 --> 00:25:30,822
it already has
a sinister history.

367
00:25:30,906 --> 00:25:33,659
There have been
two murders,

368
00:25:33,742 --> 00:25:35,536
a vitriol-throwing,
a suicide,

369
00:25:35,661 --> 00:25:37,704
and several robberies
brought about for the sake

370
00:25:37,788 --> 00:25:41,041
of this forty-grain weight
of crystallized charcoal.

371
00:25:41,124 --> 00:25:43,877
Who would think that
so pretty a toy

372
00:25:44,002 --> 00:25:47,840
could be a purveyor
to the gallows and the prison?

373
00:25:52,427 --> 00:25:53,220
Come in.

374
00:25:54,596 --> 00:25:58,475
Mr. Henry Baker,
I believe?

375
00:25:58,600 --> 00:26:03,814
Please,
draw near the fire.

376
00:26:03,939 --> 00:26:07,442
It is a cold night and I observe
that your circulation

377
00:26:07,568 --> 00:26:09,736
is more adapted for
summer than for winter.

378
00:26:09,862 --> 00:26:12,865
Do sit down.

379
00:26:12,948 --> 00:26:15,450
This is my friend and colleague,
Dr. Watson.

380
00:26:15,534 --> 00:26:17,244
How do you do,
sir?

381
00:26:17,327 --> 00:26:21,748
Mr. Baker...

382
00:26:26,128 --> 00:26:29,965
is that your hat?

383
00:26:30,090 --> 00:26:38,265
Oh, yes, oh,
it is undoubtedly my hat.

384
00:26:38,390 --> 00:26:40,559
Thank you,
sir.

385
00:26:40,642 --> 00:26:44,771
I would have advertised
its loss but shillings

386
00:26:44,897 --> 00:26:48,483
have not been so plentiful
with me as they once were.

387
00:26:48,609 --> 00:26:51,236
I had no doubt that
the gang of roughs

388
00:26:51,320 --> 00:26:55,240
who assaulted me had carried
off both my hat and the bird.

389
00:26:55,324 --> 00:26:58,410
I did not care to
spend more money

390
00:26:58,494 --> 00:27:00,621
in a hopeless attempt
at recovering them.

391
00:27:00,746 --> 00:27:03,499
Yes, well, of course,
that is very understandable.

392
00:27:03,624 --> 00:27:06,335
Oh, by the way,
about your bird,

393
00:27:06,460 --> 00:27:12,799
we were compelled
to eat it.

394
00:27:12,883 --> 00:27:15,260
To eat it.

395
00:27:15,344 --> 00:27:19,264
It would have been of little use
to anyone had we not done so.

396
00:27:19,348 --> 00:27:22,309
But we have another goose
upon the sideboard there,

397
00:27:22,392 --> 00:27:25,312
which I presume will answer
your purpose equally well.

398
00:27:25,395 --> 00:27:26,813
It is about
the same weight,

399
00:27:26,897 --> 00:27:29,483
and perfectly fresh,
as you can see.

400
00:27:29,608 --> 00:27:32,402
Oh, yes,
most certainly.

401
00:27:32,528 --> 00:27:37,449
Of course, we have kept
the feathers, legs, crop,

402
00:27:37,533 --> 00:27:40,744
and so on of your own
bird, if you so wish.

403
00:27:40,869 --> 00:27:42,830
It might be useful to me
as relics of my adventure,

404
00:27:42,913 --> 00:27:45,958
but beyond
that I can hardly see

405
00:27:46,041 --> 00:27:49,378
what use the disjectamembra
of my old acquaintance

406
00:27:49,503 --> 00:27:52,172
could possibly
be to me.

407
00:27:52,297 --> 00:27:54,216
Oh, no, sir,
with your permission,

408
00:27:54,341 --> 00:27:56,802
I - I shall confine
my attentions

409
00:27:56,885 --> 00:28:00,097
to the excellent bird which
I perceive upon your sideboard.

410
00:28:00,222 --> 00:28:02,224
I would be
interested to know

411
00:28:02,349 --> 00:28:03,308
where the other
bird came from.

412
00:28:03,433 --> 00:28:05,686
You see, I am somewhat
of a fowl fancier,

413
00:28:05,811 --> 00:28:08,605
and I have seldom seen
a better grown bird.

414
00:28:08,730 --> 00:28:10,524
It would be of great
interest to me to know

415
00:28:10,649 --> 00:28:13,735
precisely how it came
into your possession.

416
00:28:13,861 --> 00:28:17,322
It was the club, sir,
the goose club.

417
00:28:17,406 --> 00:28:23,036
The goose club,
the exact circumstances?

418
00:28:23,120 --> 00:28:25,789
I - I
am not a rich man,

419
00:28:25,914 --> 00:28:28,876
as you may see, sir,
but I make a humble living,

420
00:28:29,001 --> 00:28:31,628
and a respectable one,
if I may say so,

421
00:28:31,753 --> 00:28:33,881
in the British
Museum.

422
00:28:33,964 --> 00:28:36,550
Studying?

423
00:28:36,633 --> 00:28:41,555
Studying,
you might say,

424
00:28:41,638 --> 00:28:44,099
and helping others
with their studies.

425
00:28:44,224 --> 00:28:47,644
I - I have a certain
knowledge of books.

426
00:28:47,769 --> 00:28:51,440
That day, sir, I had
finished work early

427
00:28:51,565 --> 00:28:55,777
and left the museum
in the afternoon.

428
00:28:55,903 --> 00:28:58,655
I had a little
business to attend to

429
00:28:58,780 --> 00:29:01,366
before calling in at
the Alpha Public House.

430
00:29:01,450 --> 00:29:03,869
Several of us who
work in the museum

431
00:29:03,952 --> 00:29:04,786
frequent that
establishment,

432
00:29:04,912 --> 00:29:07,456
and this year
our good host,

433
00:29:07,581 --> 00:29:11,210
Mr. Windigate,
had instigated a goose club,

434
00:29:11,293 --> 00:29:14,087
by which, on consideration of
some few pence each week,

435
00:29:14,213 --> 00:29:18,425
we were to receive a bird
at Christmas.

436
00:29:24,097 --> 00:29:25,891
There we are,
Mr. Baker,

437
00:29:25,974 --> 00:29:28,227
a very fine bird,
as promised.

438
00:29:30,979 --> 00:29:35,484
Magnificent specimen,
indeed, landlord, eh.

439
00:29:35,609 --> 00:29:38,487
Put you back in the wife's
good books, eh?

440
00:29:38,570 --> 00:29:42,866
Well, she is still somewhat
irked with me, I'm afraid.

441
00:29:42,991 --> 00:29:46,662
Things may doubtless
improve when I am

442
00:29:46,787 --> 00:29:49,498
once more in gainful
employment.

443
00:29:49,623 --> 00:29:51,166
Oh, an academic nature,
of course.

444
00:29:51,291 --> 00:29:53,669
I have
expectations.

445
00:29:53,794 --> 00:29:59,925
Well, I owe you one last
payment of eight pennies, eh.

446
00:30:00,008 --> 00:30:03,053
Struck it rich,
have we, Mr. B?

447
00:30:03,178 --> 00:30:05,347
I chanced upon
an acquaintance

448
00:30:05,472 --> 00:30:09,810
of sympathetic disposition,
l, that is to say,

449
00:30:09,893 --> 00:30:14,022
I sold some
of my books.

450
00:30:14,147 --> 00:30:18,944
Oh, not your books,
Mr. Baker.

451
00:30:19,027 --> 00:30:21,488
Needs must,
Mr. Windigate,

452
00:30:21,572 --> 00:30:23,740
and at this season of
the year more than ever,

453
00:30:23,866 --> 00:30:26,910
we must not deprive
those we love,

454
00:30:27,035 --> 00:30:32,082
or even those to whom
we are married.

455
00:30:32,207 --> 00:30:35,043
And so, if you will set aside
this impressive peace offering,

456
00:30:35,169 --> 00:30:38,088
I shall fortify myself
for the fray

457
00:30:38,213 --> 00:30:40,549
with a large
glass of whiskey,

458
00:30:40,674 --> 00:30:43,302
and a pint of your
most excellent beer.

459
00:30:54,563 --> 00:30:55,898
Merry Christmas
to you.

460
00:30:56,023 --> 00:30:57,107
Same to you,
Mr. Baker.

461
00:31:04,281 --> 00:31:07,034
Well, sir,
on my way home

462
00:31:07,117 --> 00:31:09,244
I was attacked by
the gang of roughs,

463
00:31:09,369 --> 00:31:11,830
who I believed had
stolen the goose.

464
00:31:11,955 --> 00:31:14,374
My hat came off
in the scuffle.

465
00:31:14,458 --> 00:31:16,418
I - I remember
little of it,

466
00:31:16,543 --> 00:31:18,921
save that a uniformed officer
appeared on the scene

467
00:31:19,004 --> 00:31:22,549
and we all
made off.

468
00:31:22,633 --> 00:31:25,385
Yes, of course,
we quite understand.

469
00:31:25,469 --> 00:31:26,428
In the
circumstances.

470
00:31:26,553 --> 00:31:29,431
Well, all is well
that ends well.

471
00:31:37,606 --> 00:31:40,859
I am most indebted to you,
sir, for your trouble.

472
00:31:40,943 --> 00:31:42,653
A scottish bonnet,
I fear,

473
00:31:42,778 --> 00:31:47,324
is fitted neither to my
years nor to my dignity.

474
00:31:47,449 --> 00:31:49,827
My complements of the
season to you, sir.

475
00:31:49,952 --> 00:31:53,330
And to you,
too, sir.

476
00:31:53,455 --> 00:31:57,584
Oh, thank you,
sir.

477
00:31:57,709 --> 00:32:01,296
Oh, uh,
by the way,

478
00:32:01,421 --> 00:32:03,882
do you have gas laid
on in your house?

479
00:32:04,007 --> 00:32:08,095
Gas, alas, no.

480
00:32:08,220 --> 00:32:09,930
Jolly good.

481
00:32:10,013 --> 00:32:11,473
Merry Christmas.

482
00:32:11,598 --> 00:32:14,768
And to you both,
gentlemen.

483
00:32:14,893 --> 00:32:17,354
Well then, so much
for Mr. Henry Baker.

484
00:32:17,479 --> 00:32:20,274
He obviously knows
nothing of the matter.

485
00:32:20,357 --> 00:32:22,359
Ah,
Mrs. Hudson.

486
00:32:22,484 --> 00:32:24,778
Watson, do you
need nourishment?

487
00:32:24,862 --> 00:32:26,155
Not particularly.

488
00:32:26,280 --> 00:32:27,114
Splendid.

489
00:32:27,197 --> 00:32:29,616
Mrs. Hudson, we shall
turn dinner into supper,

490
00:32:29,700 --> 00:32:33,412
and we will follow up
this clue while it is still hot.

491
00:32:33,495 --> 00:32:36,623
Which is more than
the supper will be.

492
00:32:52,222 --> 00:32:55,309
Good evening, gentlemen,
and a very cold one.

493
00:32:55,392 --> 00:32:57,895
It is, indeed, landlord,
it is indeed.

494
00:32:58,020 --> 00:32:59,605
And what shall be
your pleasure?

495
00:32:59,688 --> 00:33:01,899
Beer, Watson?

496
00:33:02,024 --> 00:33:03,066
What? Oh, yes,
splendid.

497
00:33:03,192 --> 00:33:04,985
Two of your very best
glasses of beer.

498
00:33:05,068 --> 00:33:06,236
Right away,
sir.

499
00:33:06,361 --> 00:33:07,571
Your beer should
be excellent

500
00:33:07,696 --> 00:33:10,616
if it is as good
as your geese.

501
00:33:10,699 --> 00:33:12,951
What geese?

502
00:33:13,035 --> 00:33:14,995
Yes. We were talking,
um, half an hour ago

503
00:33:15,078 --> 00:33:18,874
to a Mr. Henry Baker, a member
of your goose club.

504
00:33:18,999 --> 00:33:21,668
Yes, but you see,
them's not our geese.

505
00:33:21,793 --> 00:33:24,129
Whose, then?

506
00:33:24,213 --> 00:33:26,673
Well, I got the whole
two dozen

507
00:33:26,757 --> 00:33:29,051
from a salesman
in Covent Garden.

508
00:33:29,176 --> 00:33:30,802
Who might
that be?

509
00:33:30,886 --> 00:33:32,763
Name of
Breckinridge,

510
00:33:32,888 --> 00:33:35,182
a purveyor
of the finest quality.

511
00:33:35,265 --> 00:33:37,351
Mind you, if it's
a bird you're after,

512
00:33:37,434 --> 00:33:39,645
I'd get to him
as soon as poss.

513
00:33:39,728 --> 00:33:40,938
Oh, it's a very
busy time of year,

514
00:33:41,063 --> 00:33:42,648
as you'll
appreciate.

515
00:33:42,731 --> 00:33:45,442
Well, thank you so much
for your advice.

516
00:33:45,567 --> 00:33:49,988
Will you have a glass
of beer with us, landlord?

517
00:33:50,072 --> 00:33:54,409
Well, God bless you
for a gentleman.

518
00:34:05,838 --> 00:34:09,424
Now, for
Mr. Breckinridge.

519
00:34:09,550 --> 00:34:11,426
Can't it wait?

520
00:34:11,552 --> 00:34:13,554
Watson, we have been given
a line of investigation

521
00:34:13,679 --> 00:34:16,098
which has been missed
by the police,

522
00:34:16,223 --> 00:34:18,934
and which a singular chance
has placed in our hands.

523
00:34:19,059 --> 00:34:21,103
Now, let us follow it
out to the bitter end.

524
00:34:21,228 --> 00:34:22,312
Extremely bitter.

525
00:34:22,437 --> 00:34:25,774
Faces to the south, then,
and quick, march.

526
00:34:39,788 --> 00:34:41,874
Please.

527
00:34:41,957 --> 00:34:51,508
I want to believe you,
John, I do, really,

528
00:34:51,633 --> 00:34:54,761
but I can't argue
with what the police is saying.

529
00:34:54,845 --> 00:34:58,640
But they're only saying that
cause I was there on the day.

530
00:34:58,765 --> 00:35:00,434
It was an
odd job.

531
00:35:00,559 --> 00:35:03,979
Is that really
the truth?

532
00:35:04,104 --> 00:35:06,064
I promised
when I married you,

533
00:35:06,148 --> 00:35:09,318
I'd never tell you
a lie.

534
00:35:09,443 --> 00:35:13,780
I kept my promise,
always will.

535
00:35:26,168 --> 00:35:28,712
I want to
believe you.

536
00:36:27,729 --> 00:36:29,106
Uh,
good evening.

537
00:36:29,231 --> 00:36:30,274
Good evening.

538
00:36:30,399 --> 00:36:32,317
Sold out of geese,
I see.

539
00:36:32,401 --> 00:36:34,653
Yeah, I'll have five hundred
in the morning.

540
00:36:34,736 --> 00:36:36,530
Too late,
I think.

541
00:36:36,655 --> 00:36:39,575
See the stall over there
with the gas fire, try him.

542
00:36:39,700 --> 00:36:42,369
Yes, but I was
recommended to you.

543
00:36:42,494 --> 00:36:43,704
Oh, who by?

544
00:36:43,787 --> 00:36:46,206
The landlord of
the Alpha Public House.

545
00:36:46,290 --> 00:36:48,834
Oh, yeah,
he had a couple of dozen off me.

546
00:36:48,917 --> 00:36:50,711
Very good geese, too.

547
00:36:50,794 --> 00:36:55,215
Where, may I ask,
did you get them?

548
00:36:55,299 --> 00:36:58,719
Here then, mister,

549
00:36:58,802 --> 00:37:00,429
what exactly are you
driving at?

550
00:37:00,554 --> 00:37:02,723
Come on, let's have
it straight, now.

551
00:37:02,848 --> 00:37:04,558
It's straight enough.

552
00:37:04,641 --> 00:37:06,935
I simply want to know
who sold you the geese

553
00:37:07,060 --> 00:37:08,770
that you supplied
to the Alpha.

554
00:37:08,896 --> 00:37:14,026
Well then, I'm not gonna
tell you, so now.

555
00:37:14,109 --> 00:37:17,696
It really is of no matter,
but I fail to see

556
00:37:17,779 --> 00:37:21,283
why you should get so warm
over a trifle.

557
00:37:21,408 --> 00:37:26,079
Warm, you'd be as warm if you
were as pestered as I am.

558
00:37:26,163 --> 00:37:28,123
When I pay good money
for a good article

559
00:37:28,207 --> 00:37:29,750
that should be
an end of it;

560
00:37:29,833 --> 00:37:31,293
but it's where
are the geese,

561
00:37:31,376 --> 00:37:32,628
who have
you sold them to,

562
00:37:32,753 --> 00:37:34,254
how much will you
take for them?

563
00:37:34,379 --> 00:37:36,131
You would think those were
the only geese in the world,

564
00:37:36,256 --> 00:37:38,634
the amount of fuss
that's made over them.

565
00:37:38,717 --> 00:37:40,719
Well, I can assure you
that I have no connection

566
00:37:40,802 --> 00:37:42,846
with anybody else
who's made inquiries.

567
00:37:42,971 --> 00:37:45,432
Inquiries, it's more
like the inquisition.

568
00:37:45,557 --> 00:37:48,852
I'm not
telling you.

569
00:37:48,977 --> 00:37:53,982
Ah, well then,
the bet is off.

570
00:37:54,107 --> 00:37:55,901
What bet?

571
00:37:55,984 --> 00:37:59,404
What bet?

572
00:37:59,488 --> 00:38:03,408
Well, I'm always ready
to back my opinion

573
00:38:03,492 --> 00:38:05,702
on the matter
of fowls,

574
00:38:05,828 --> 00:38:08,539
and I have a fiver
with my friend here

575
00:38:08,664 --> 00:38:13,293
that the bird that I chose
is country bred, right, Watson?

576
00:38:13,377 --> 00:38:16,755
What? Oh, oh, oh,
yes, yes, absolutely.

577
00:38:16,839 --> 00:38:20,008
Ah, you've lost your money
then, cause it's town bred.

578
00:38:20,133 --> 00:38:21,468
It is nothing
of the kind.

579
00:38:21,552 --> 00:38:22,761
I say it is.

580
00:38:22,845 --> 00:38:24,346
I don't
believe you.

581
00:38:24,429 --> 00:38:27,015
Come on, pay up,
Holmes.

582
00:38:27,140 --> 00:38:28,642
What, do you think
I wouldn't know,

583
00:38:28,767 --> 00:38:31,186
me, who's been handling fowl
since I was a nipper?

584
00:38:31,311 --> 00:38:32,145
I'll tell you,

585
00:38:32,229 --> 00:38:35,566
all the birds that went
to the Alpha were town bred.

586
00:38:35,691 --> 00:38:37,609
You'll never make me
believe that.

587
00:38:37,693 --> 00:38:40,779
Come on, come on,
do the decent, Holmes.

588
00:38:40,863 --> 00:38:42,364
Will you have a bet,
then?

589
00:38:42,447 --> 00:38:44,158
I'll be just taking
your money,

590
00:38:44,241 --> 00:38:45,909
but I'll have a sovereign
with you,

591
00:38:46,034 --> 00:38:48,453
just to teach you
not to be obstinate.

592
00:38:48,537 --> 00:38:49,663
Done.

593
00:38:49,788 --> 00:38:53,000
Right.

594
00:38:53,125 --> 00:38:54,710
Now then,
Mr. Cocksure,

595
00:38:54,835 --> 00:38:56,670
you see these here
books here, well,

596
00:38:56,753 --> 00:38:59,131
this is a list of all
the folk what I buy off.

597
00:38:59,214 --> 00:39:01,633
Now, on this page is
all me country folk,

598
00:39:01,717 --> 00:39:05,512
and these on this side in red
ink are all me town suppliers.

599
00:39:05,637 --> 00:39:09,558
Now you read out that
third name down to me.

600
00:39:09,683 --> 00:39:12,769
Mrs. Oakshott,
117 Brixton Road.

601
00:39:12,895 --> 00:39:15,063
Yeah, account
number 249.

602
00:39:15,189 --> 00:39:20,068
Go on, then, turn
it up in the ledger.

603
00:39:20,194 --> 00:39:22,863
Mrs. Oakshott,
egg and poultry supplier?

604
00:39:22,946 --> 00:39:25,199
Now, what's
the last entry?

605
00:39:25,282 --> 00:39:27,743
Twenty-four geese
at seven and six pence,

606
00:39:27,826 --> 00:39:33,373
sold to Mr. Windigate
of the Alpha Public House.

607
00:39:33,457 --> 00:39:36,335
So, what are you
gonna say now?

608
00:39:43,008 --> 00:39:46,345
What about this
gentleman's fiver?

609
00:40:00,692 --> 00:40:03,612
Well done,
Holmes.

610
00:40:03,695 --> 00:40:07,616
Shall we see this
Mrs. Oakshott tonight?

611
00:40:07,699 --> 00:40:09,117
Oh, no, not you again,
I've had enough of you.

612
00:40:09,201 --> 00:40:11,036
Listen, I've told you
before, clear off.

613
00:40:11,119 --> 00:40:13,205
But the thing is, there
were two gray-headed geese.

614
00:40:13,288 --> 00:40:15,958
Now, listen, I've had enough
of you and those geese.

615
00:40:16,083 --> 00:40:17,793
I wish you was all
at the devil together.

616
00:40:17,918 --> 00:40:20,087
If you come pestering me
any more with your silly talk

617
00:40:20,170 --> 00:40:21,505
I'll set
the dog on you.

618
00:40:21,630 --> 00:40:23,882
Now, look here,
Mrs. Oakshott told me -

619
00:40:23,966 --> 00:40:27,427
You bring Mrs. Oakshott here,
and I'll answer her,

620
00:40:27,553 --> 00:40:29,429
but what have you got
to do with it, eh?

621
00:40:29,513 --> 00:40:30,764
Did I buy the geese
off you?

622
00:40:30,889 --> 00:40:33,851
No; but one of them
was mine all the same.

623
00:40:33,976 --> 00:40:36,270
Well, you go and ask
Mrs. Oakshott for it.

624
00:40:36,395 --> 00:40:38,272
She told me
to ask you.

625
00:40:38,355 --> 00:40:41,108
You can ask the King of Prusia,
for all I care.

626
00:40:41,191 --> 00:40:42,442
I've had enough
of this.

627
00:40:42,526 --> 00:40:45,404
Go on,
get out of it.

628
00:40:45,487 --> 00:40:49,408
This may save us
a trip to Brixton.

629
00:41:38,123 --> 00:41:40,292
Excuse me, but I could
not help overhearing

630
00:41:40,375 --> 00:41:43,170
the conversation you had just
now with that salesman.

631
00:41:43,295 --> 00:41:46,006
I think I can be of assistance
to you in this matter.

632
00:41:46,089 --> 00:41:47,799
Yea,
who are you?

633
00:41:47,883 --> 00:41:49,384
My name
is Sherlock Holmes.

634
00:41:49,468 --> 00:41:52,596
It is my business to know
what other people don't know.

635
00:41:52,721 --> 00:41:54,056
But you could know
nothing of this.

636
00:41:54,181 --> 00:41:57,059
On the contrary,
I know everything of it.

637
00:41:57,184 --> 00:41:58,894
I know that you are
trying to find out

638
00:41:59,019 --> 00:42:01,897
the whereabouts of some geese
sold by Mrs. Oakshott,

639
00:42:02,022 --> 00:42:05,984
of Brixton Road, to our friend,
Mr. Breckinridge, over there.

640
00:42:06,068 --> 00:42:09,071
Who in turn, sold
them to Mr. Windigate,

641
00:42:09,196 --> 00:42:12,574
of the Alpha Public House.

642
00:42:12,699 --> 00:42:17,079
Sir, you're the very man
I have longed to meet.

643
00:42:17,204 --> 00:42:21,500
I can hardly explain to you
my interest in the matter.

644
00:42:21,583 --> 00:42:24,711
Then I suggest that we
carry on this conversation

645
00:42:24,795 --> 00:42:27,714
in rather
more comfort.

646
00:42:27,798 --> 00:42:29,716
Cab.

647
00:42:42,729 --> 00:42:47,693
Come in,
take my chair.

648
00:42:47,776 --> 00:42:53,740
I will just put
on my slippers.

649
00:42:53,824 --> 00:42:56,952
Ah.

650
00:42:57,077 --> 00:42:59,872
I think we should know
the name of the gentleman

651
00:42:59,955 --> 00:43:03,834
whom we have the pleasure
of assisting, don't you, Watson?

652
00:43:03,959 --> 00:43:05,961
John Robinson.

653
00:43:06,086 --> 00:43:07,462
Oh, no, no,
no, no;

654
00:43:07,588 --> 00:43:08,797
your real name.

655
00:43:08,922 --> 00:43:12,092
It is so awkward doing
business with an alias.

656
00:43:12,217 --> 00:43:14,052
Well then, uh,

657
00:43:14,136 --> 00:43:16,930
my real name is
Ryder, James Ryder.

658
00:43:17,014 --> 00:43:19,057
Yes, Mr. Ryder,

659
00:43:19,141 --> 00:43:24,730
upper attendant at
the Hotel Cosmopolitan.

660
00:43:24,813 --> 00:43:27,357
Yes.

661
00:43:27,483 --> 00:43:29,526
And I suppose you would
like to know what happened

662
00:43:29,651 --> 00:43:34,281
to these geese, or, rather,
one goose, in particular,

663
00:43:34,364 --> 00:43:36,950
white, with a gray head?

664
00:43:37,034 --> 00:43:41,079
Oh, sir, can you tell me
where it went to?

665
00:43:41,163 --> 00:43:43,123
It came here.

666
00:43:43,207 --> 00:43:44,666
Here?

667
00:43:44,750 --> 00:43:47,252
Sadly, it is
no longer here.

668
00:43:47,377 --> 00:43:52,341
But it laid an egg after
it was dead -

669
00:43:52,466 --> 00:44:01,475
the bonniest, brightest little
blue egg you have ever seen.

670
00:44:01,558 --> 00:44:07,356
Come, come,
I have it.

671
00:44:20,869 --> 00:44:25,958
The game is up,
Ryder.

672
00:44:26,041 --> 00:44:31,547
Bear up, man, you'll
be in the fire.

673
00:44:31,672 --> 00:44:34,591
And what a wretched little
shrimp it is, to be sure,

674
00:44:34,716 --> 00:44:37,678
there's enough blood
in him for felony.

675
00:44:37,803 --> 00:44:39,763
I have almost every link
in the chain, Ryder,

676
00:44:39,888 --> 00:44:43,183
you need tell
me very little.

677
00:44:43,267 --> 00:44:46,270
Catherine Cusack
put me up to it.

678
00:44:46,395 --> 00:44:47,855
Her Ladyship's maid.

679
00:44:47,980 --> 00:44:49,481
Exactly.

680
00:44:49,606 --> 00:44:51,567
You knew from local
gossip that Horner

681
00:44:51,650 --> 00:44:53,986
had been concerned in some
such matter before.

682
00:44:54,069 --> 00:44:56,572
So what did you do,

683
00:44:56,655 --> 00:45:00,075
you made some small job
in milady's room,

684
00:45:00,200 --> 00:45:03,203
you and your
confederate Cusack.

685
00:45:03,328 --> 00:45:06,582
You then managed that
Horner should be sent for.

686
00:45:06,707 --> 00:45:11,420
But you, you stole the jewel,
then you raised the alarm

687
00:45:11,545 --> 00:45:13,589
and had this
unfortunate man arrested.

688
00:45:13,714 --> 00:45:17,843
For God's sake,
Mr. Holmes, have mercy.

689
00:45:17,926 --> 00:45:20,512
Think of my father,
think of my mother,

690
00:45:20,596 --> 00:45:22,639
it would break
their hearts.

691
00:45:22,764 --> 00:45:24,224
I mean, I never
went wrong before,

692
00:45:24,308 --> 00:45:27,769
I never will again.
I swear it on a Bible.

693
00:45:27,853 --> 00:45:30,606
Oh, don't - don't bring
me to court, Mr. Holmes.

694
00:45:30,731 --> 00:45:32,941
For God's sake,
don't do that to me.

695
00:45:33,066 --> 00:45:36,778
Get back into
your chair.

696
00:45:36,904 --> 00:45:38,864
It is very well
to cringe and crawl now,

697
00:45:38,947 --> 00:45:40,908
but you thought little
of the man that you sent

698
00:45:40,991 --> 00:45:43,577
to the dock for a crime
of which he knew nothing.

699
00:45:43,660 --> 00:45:45,746
I'll fly,
Mr.Holmes.

700
00:45:45,829 --> 00:45:47,623
I'll leave
the country.

701
00:45:47,748 --> 00:45:53,128
Then the charge against him
will break down.

702
00:45:53,212 --> 00:45:57,007
We'll talk
about that later.

703
00:45:57,132 --> 00:46:02,429
Now tell me, how came
the stone into the goose,

704
00:46:02,513 --> 00:46:04,806
and how came the goose
into the open market?

705
00:46:04,932 --> 00:46:06,308
Tell me the truth, now,

706
00:46:06,433 --> 00:46:09,102
for that is your
only hope of safety.

707
00:46:09,186 --> 00:46:12,689
I'll tell it to you
just as it happened.

708
00:46:12,815 --> 00:46:15,275
I thought it was best
to get away with the stone

709
00:46:15,359 --> 00:46:17,194
as quick as I could,

710
00:46:17,319 --> 00:46:19,655
for I didn't know at what moment
the police might not take it

711
00:46:19,780 --> 00:46:25,160
into their heads
to search me and my room.

712
00:46:25,285 --> 00:46:27,329
There was nowhere in the hotel
where it would be safe.

713
00:46:27,454 --> 00:46:29,915
So, I went out,
as if on some commission,

714
00:46:29,998 --> 00:46:35,546
and made for my sister's
house to think things over.

715
00:46:35,671 --> 00:46:41,385
Why, Jim, whatever is it,
you look terrible.

716
00:46:41,510 --> 00:46:43,971
I had a bit of a turn,
Maggie.

717
00:46:44,096 --> 00:46:46,306
There's been a robbery
at the hotel.

718
00:46:46,431 --> 00:46:49,726
You'd better
come in.

719
00:46:49,852 --> 00:46:54,106
I went into the back yard
where she kept the geese,

720
00:46:54,189 --> 00:46:58,068
smoked a pipe, and wondered
what it would be best to do.

721
00:46:58,193 --> 00:47:00,112
I remember that my stomach
wasn't gonna stop

722
00:47:00,195 --> 00:47:02,698
feeling like
a bag of ferrets

723
00:47:02,781 --> 00:47:05,909
till I found somewhere
to hide the stone for a while,

724
00:47:06,034 --> 00:47:07,786
when suddenly,
I looked at the geese,

725
00:47:07,870 --> 00:47:11,623
which was hissing and huddling
in the corner of the yard.

726
00:47:11,707 --> 00:47:14,376
My sister had told me
that I might have the pick

727
00:47:14,501 --> 00:47:17,504
of her geese for
a Christmas present.

728
00:47:17,629 --> 00:47:20,549
I picked out one
of the birds,

729
00:47:20,674 --> 00:47:23,468
a fine thick one
with a gray head.

730
00:47:42,404 --> 00:47:44,323
I pushed the stone
down its throat

731
00:47:44,406 --> 00:47:47,493
as far as my finger
could reach.

732
00:47:47,576 --> 00:47:50,245
Then I thought all my
troubles was over, when...

733
00:47:50,370 --> 00:47:55,334
Whatever are you doing
with that bird, Jim?

734
00:47:55,417 --> 00:47:59,463
Uh, you said I could have
one for Christmas,

735
00:47:59,588 --> 00:48:01,965
so I was just feeling
which is the fattest.

736
00:48:02,090 --> 00:48:04,051
We already set
yours aside -

737
00:48:04,176 --> 00:48:06,887
Jim's bird,
we call it.

738
00:48:07,012 --> 00:48:09,223
Uh, if it's
all the same to you, Maggie,

739
00:48:09,348 --> 00:48:12,226
I'd rather have that
one I was handling just now.

740
00:48:12,309 --> 00:48:14,603
Well, that one is a good
three pounds heavier,

741
00:48:14,728 --> 00:48:16,730
we fattened it up
expressly.

742
00:48:16,855 --> 00:48:18,524
Never mind.

743
00:48:18,607 --> 00:48:21,235
I'll take the other,
and I'll take it now.

744
00:48:21,360 --> 00:48:22,778
Just as
you like.

745
00:48:22,903 --> 00:48:24,446
Which one
is it?

746
00:48:24,571 --> 00:48:26,532
It's that gray-headed one
in the middle.

747
00:48:26,615 --> 00:48:28,075
Oh,
very well.

748
00:48:28,158 --> 00:48:30,202
Kill it and take
it with you.

749
00:48:34,164 --> 00:48:36,124
I did what she said,
Mr. Holmes,

750
00:48:36,208 --> 00:48:39,920
and I carried the bird to
my pal, we got a knife,

751
00:48:40,045 --> 00:48:44,758
and we opened it up,
my heart turned to water,

752
00:48:44,883 --> 00:48:47,803
there was no sign
of the stone,

753
00:48:47,928 --> 00:48:51,098
and I knew some terrible
mistake must have occurred.

754
00:49:09,491 --> 00:49:11,118
Where have they
all gone?

755
00:49:11,201 --> 00:49:12,661
To the dealer's.

756
00:49:12,744 --> 00:49:13,662
Which dealer's?

757
00:49:13,787 --> 00:49:17,374
Breckinridge,
of Covent Garden.

758
00:49:17,499 --> 00:49:18,959
Tell me,
just tell me,

759
00:49:19,084 --> 00:49:22,337
was there another one
which had a gray head?

760
00:49:22,462 --> 00:49:24,423
That's right, two,

761
00:49:24,548 --> 00:49:27,134
I could never tell them apart,
I couldn't.

762
00:49:27,259 --> 00:49:30,679
Well, what's the matter,
what's all the hurry?

763
00:49:30,804 --> 00:49:32,472
I ran as hard
as my feet would carry me

764
00:49:32,556 --> 00:49:34,516
to this man
Breckinridge;

765
00:49:34,641 --> 00:49:36,894
but he had sold the lot,
and not one word

766
00:49:37,019 --> 00:49:40,272
would he tell me
as to where they had gone.

767
00:49:40,355 --> 00:49:44,318
I've gone mad.

768
00:49:44,443 --> 00:49:48,572
And now I'm
a branded thief,

769
00:49:48,697 --> 00:49:51,325
without ever having
touched the wealth

770
00:49:51,450 --> 00:49:54,995
for which I've sold
my character.

771
00:49:55,120 --> 00:50:00,042
God help me.
God help me.

772
00:50:14,056 --> 00:50:18,435
Get out.

773
00:50:18,560 --> 00:50:24,358
What?

774
00:50:24,441 --> 00:50:28,862
Heavens,
bless you, sir.

775
00:50:28,946 --> 00:50:32,115
No more words.

776
00:50:32,241 --> 00:50:35,118
Get out.

777
00:50:56,932 --> 00:50:58,141
I must confess,
Holmes,

778
00:50:58,267 --> 00:51:01,061
to being a little
surprised.

779
00:51:01,144 --> 00:51:10,112
I am not retained by the police
to supply their deficiencies.

780
00:51:10,237 --> 00:51:18,120
Maybe I am committing a felony,
but I may be saving a soul.

781
00:51:18,203 --> 00:51:21,582
Send him to jail now, you
make him a jailbird for life.

782
00:51:43,604 --> 00:51:48,400
Listen, after all, it is the
season for forgiveness, come.

783
00:51:48,484 --> 00:51:51,403
Midnight.

784
00:51:51,487 --> 00:51:53,780
Merry Christmas,
Holmes.

785
00:51:53,906 --> 00:51:56,950
And to you,
my dear friend.

786
00:51:57,034 --> 00:51:58,952
Just a minute.

787
00:51:59,036 --> 00:52:01,246
Holmes, I cannot
contemplate eating

788
00:52:01,330 --> 00:52:04,875
while John Horner
is still on remand.

789
00:52:05,000 --> 00:52:07,961
Do you suppose that Bradstreet
or one of his colleagues

790
00:52:08,086 --> 00:52:11,381
might still
be at their desks?

791
00:52:11,507 --> 00:52:16,011
You're quite right, Watson,
come, let's go.
