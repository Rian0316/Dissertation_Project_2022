All right. You're a sight for sore eyes.

19

You're looking good.

Sorry you had to come all this way.

It's a long way, right?

23
00:01:04,681 --> 00:01:07,398
- It's a long way.
- Yeah. Sorry.

32
00:01:30,624 --> 00:01:33,341

34

of horse crap, Chuck.

37
00:01:41,802 --> 00:01:43,802
- Come on.
- Is that what I tell the judge...

38
00:01:43,854 --> 00:01:45,019

52

Come on, Chuck.

53
00:02:27,063 --> 00:02:30,231
I haven't seen you in what, five years?

54
00:02:30,267 --> 00:02:32,851
We barely hear from you.

55
00:02:32,903 --> 00:02:35,270

call me yourself... you have<i> mom</i> call me?

57
00:02:37,107 --> 00:02:39,073
Mom took it upon herself to call you!

58
00:02:39,109 --> 00:02:40,909
I was just letting her know where I was.

59
00:02:40,944 --> 00:02:43,912
- You didn't cry to her on the phone?
- What? No.

60
00:02:43,947 --> 00:02:46,331
You didn't cry and beg mom for help?

61
00:02:46,366 --> 00:02:48,199
What? Jesus!

62
00:02:48,251 --> 00:02:50,618
She hears what she wants to hear, okay?

63
00:02:50,620 --> 00:02:52,170

I'm a lousy brother. I'm a big screw-up.

71
00:03:12,943 --> 00:03:16,110
And if I was just a better person,

72
00:03:16,146 --> 00:03:19,314
I would not only stop letting<i> you</i> down...

73
00:03:19,316 --> 00:03:22,734
You know what? I'd stop letting<i> me</i> down.

74

75
00:03:24,621 --> 00:03:28,406
that I started to make both of us proud.

00:03:28,458 --> 00:03:29,874
Am I right?

77
00:03:29,910 --> 00:03:31,075
- Guard.
- Wait.

79
00:03:33,129 --> 00:03:35,079
No, no. You can't leave me. No.

out of this, my life is over!

82
00:03:43,640 --> 00:03:45,006
Yeah.

83
00:03:45,008 --> 00:03:48,426
Jimmy, if I do this...

00:03:53,934 --> 00:03:57,318
I promise I won't.

with... that's over.

Whatever it is, I'll do it.

Just say it.

did Kettleman get away with?

Uh, excuse me,

isn't careful with that money,

161
00:08:31,256 --> 00:08:34,207
I mean [sighs] his whole family
could be in danger.

162
00:08:34,259 --> 00:08:36,092
What do you mean, "danger"?

163
00:08:36,127 --> 00:08:39,929
Jimmy, why would you say that?

164
00:08:39,965 --> 00:08:42,348
What?

165
00:08:42,384 --> 00:08:46,553
You said the family might be in danger.

166
00:08:46,605 --> 00:08:49,772
I did? I... oh, I, uh...

00:08:49,808 --> 00:08:52,392
[Clears throat]
I'm... I'm drunk. [Chuckles]

168
00:08:52,444 --> 00:08:56,229

I'm... I'm up, spinning, uh...
Spinning thoughts.

Yeah, yeah, yeah. Uh...

172
00:09:06,324 --> 00:09:11,711
So, I will see you
down in the court bowels <i>Mañana.</i>

240
00:14:12,877 --> 00:14:14,710

00:14:20,384 --> 00:14:22,551
- That's my final.
- That's never gonna happen.

244
00:14:22,553 --> 00:14:25,771
Oh! Come on. Now, are you joking?

245
00:14:25,806 --> 00:14:27,623
Now, that is the best deal
you're gonna get.

- [Air blowing]
- I can't do it.

247

Your guy drove drunk into a shopping center

248
00:14:32,363 --> 00:14:33,646
and killed three people.

254
00:14:45,543 --> 00:14:48,827
Yeah, okay. My bad.
Desmond Rojas. Okay, go.

255
00:14:48,880 --> 00:14:50,412
Start over.

256
00:14:50,414 --> 00:14:51,964
I am not starting over.

defendant from another?!

90 days with good behavior...
We're doing this.

262
00:15:03,761 --> 00:15:05,728
Yeah. Okay, yeah.

263
00:15:05,763 --> 00:15:08,347
Say it. Say the words, "I accept the deal."

264
00:15:08,399 --> 00:15:11,267
Yeah, I... I accept... I accept the deal.

W... what do you mean, what did I mean?

270
00:15:30,121 --> 00:15:34,123
I... I... no, I told you.
I... I was drunk. I just...

271
00:15:36,127 --> 00:15:39,962
Kim, why are you...
Why are you asking me this?

- Oh, damn it.

Here. I'm in a real rush.

00:15:44,218 --> 00:15:46,518
I didn't have time to get the validation.

275

- Fine. 9 bucks.
- [Sighs]

276

I... I don't have it.

277
00:15:55,146 --> 00:15:57,146
I have $5. Please?

278
00:15:57,148 --> 00:15:59,565
You know the drill...
Money or the validation.

279
00:15:59,617 --> 00:16:01,400
Look, this is an emergency, okay?

280
00:16:01,452 --> 00:16:02,818
A serious, serious emergency.

281
00:16:02,820 --> 00:16:04,653
I have to get out of here.

282
00:16:04,655 --> 00:16:07,072
I promise, on the souls of my forefathers,

283
00:16:07,124 --> 00:16:09,291
I will get you the stickers
when I come back.

284
00:16:09,327 --> 00:16:12,745
I will get you extra if you just let me go.

285
00:16:13,914 --> 00:16:15,714
Fine!

286
00:16:15,750 --> 00:16:18,133
Fine! You're gonna make me
walk back and get the stickers?!

287
00:16:18,169 --> 00:16:21,337
I will walk back and get the stickers!

288
00:16:21,339 --> 00:16:24,974
I'm not<i> making</i> you do anything.
Those are the rules.

289
00:16:25,009 --> 00:16:27,643
Hey, whatever helps you sleep at night.

Jimmy. What brought you here?

303
00:17:37,289 --> 00:17:38,572
Me? Uh...

304
00:17:38,588 --> 00:17:40,472
Uh, I... I was surfing the police scanner.

305
00:17:40,486 --> 00:17:42,870
I heard there was big activity
out this way.

306
00:17:42,905 --> 00:17:45,322
Well, there's no business for
you here, so maybe next time.

307
00:17:45,375 --> 00:17:47,908
Uh, it was a home invasion?
Uh, the Kettlemans okay?

308
00:17:47,910 --> 00:17:50,127
Uh, we don't know.

309
00:17:50,163 --> 00:17:51,545
A neighbor was walking the dog last night

310
00:17:51,581 --> 00:17:53,381
and saw the front door wide open.

311
00:17:53,416 --> 00:17:55,583
The place was ransacked.
No sign of the family.

312
00:17:55,585 --> 00:17:59,303
There's no note, so...
We're still figuring it out.

313
00:17:59,338 --> 00:18:01,722
I got to get back.

314
00:18:01,758 --> 00:18:05,559

- Why did you come here?
- [Scoffs]

317
00:18:18,524 --> 00:18:20,691
I'm just supporting a friend
in her time of need.

318
00:18:20,743 --> 00:18:23,661
You want to be supportive? Tell me why
you said those things last night.

319
00:18:23,696 --> 00:18:25,246
I'm just reading tea leaves,

320
00:18:25,281 --> 00:18:26,864
same way I knew
the Kettlemans needed a lawyer.

321
00:18:26,916 --> 00:18:28,282
All that money floating out there...

322
00:18:28,284 --> 00:18:30,419
It's logical somebody would come after it.

323
00:18:30,483 --> 00:18:33,234
So, the same night you worry
about them, they... Disappear?

324
00:18:33,286 --> 00:18:36,385
Yeah, it's crazy. It's "Ripley's."

325
00:18:36,585 --> 00:18:39,586
Jimmy, it's not just Craig
and Betsy Kettleman...

326
00:18:39,588 --> 00:18:41,921
It's their two kids, as well.

327
00:18:41,923 --> 00:18:46,009
You would... Say something if
you could help find them, right?

328
00:18:48,013 --> 00:18:50,180
I don't... I don't know
what happened to them.

329
00:18:50,232 --> 00:18:52,599
Really, I d... I don't know.

330
00:18:52,601 --> 00:18:54,601
The longer you stay here,

331
00:18:54,603 --> 00:18:56,069
the more explaining I have to do to Hamlin.

332
00:18:56,104 --> 00:18:57,687
I'll talk to you later.

333
00:18:57,739 --> 00:19:01,324
Hey, you'll tell me
if there's anything I can do?

335
00:19:18,043 --> 00:19:21,628
Everything is gonna be fine.

It's gonna work out.

337

Uh, and I sincerely
want to help you. [sighs]

350

De-escalate your situation,
uh, legally and otherwise.

Um, so call me at 146-8729

Uh... Just to clarify,
look, I don't know anything.

362
00:20:58,226 --> 00:21:01,394
Uh, I have spoken to no one,

363
00:21:01,396 --> 00:21:03,613
and, uh, there are no rats on this ship.

364
00:21:03,648 --> 00:21:07,450
But [sighs] for the sake
of everyone involved,

365
00:21:07,485 --> 00:21:10,453
I would just like to open a dialogue.

366
00:21:10,488 --> 00:21:13,656

time is of the essence on this matter,

so, uh, I'm gonna hang up now...
If you're trying to call.

373

Uh, there's no call waiting here

I want to tell you this was a wise move...

418
00:25:01,603 --> 00:25:04,971
Very smart, because I'm here
to help... Everyone...

They just gave me an earful. [sighs]

422
00:25:15,817 --> 00:25:22,238
And what they were telling me
is... it's problematic.

423
00:25:22,290 --> 00:25:24,323
I'm gonna pitch it back to you

424

searched it, and found blood on the floor.

So... Here we are.

[Smacks lips]

00:25:51,936 --> 00:25:58,741
Um... Um... They're calling
the FBI in on this,

00:25:58,776 --> 00:26:01,577
which makes it federal.

436
00:26:01,613 --> 00:26:03,329
That's a bad thing, Nacho.

437
00:26:03,364 --> 00:26:04,947
That's... that's very bad,

438
00:26:04,999 --> 00:26:07,033
but if you tell me where the family is,

439
00:26:07,035 --> 00:26:08,835
if... if you give them up now...

440
00:26:08,870 --> 00:26:11,037
Full cooperation, deep remorse...

441
00:26:11,039 --> 00:26:14,674

Tell me the kids are okay.

449
00:26:41,486 --> 00:26:46,289
Y... you want to tell me
your thoughts and weigh in?

450
00:26:46,324 --> 00:26:51,494
Does this sound like a plan
that you can get behind?

451
00:26:51,546 --> 00:26:55,882
You miserable piece of shit.

452
00:26:58,419 --> 00:27:01,053
- You set me up.
- I what?

453
00:27:01,089 --> 00:27:03,256
You gave my score to another crew,

454
00:27:03,258 --> 00:27:05,258
and now you're setting me up.

455
00:27:05,260 --> 00:27:08,394
I... what the what?
D... did the cops beat you?

456
00:27:08,429 --> 00:27:10,763
'Cause you're talking
like a person with head trauma.

457
00:27:10,765 --> 00:27:12,216
- You think you're funny?
- What are you saying?

458
00:27:12,265 --> 00:27:14,084
Are you saying that you
had nothing to do with this?

459
00:27:14,165 --> 00:27:16,352
That was<i> your</i> van outside the house.

460
00:27:16,404 --> 00:27:20,189
- Y... you weren't there?
- Yeah, I was there.

461
00:27:20,241 --> 00:27:22,825
I was casing the place,

462
00:27:22,860 --> 00:27:24,443
figuring out the best way in and out,

463
00:27:24,445 --> 00:27:26,445
what time they went to bed... all that.

464
00:27:26,447 --> 00:27:29,865
They were fine when I left. That's it.

465
00:27:29,918 --> 00:27:32,501
You had nothing to do with the Kettlemans?

466
00:27:32,537 --> 00:27:35,755
I was never in the house.

467

[Scoffs]

468
00:27:37,792 --> 00:27:40,376
What about the blood in your van?

469
00:27:40,428 --> 00:27:42,178
They DNA my ride,

470
00:27:42,213 --> 00:27:45,381
all they're gonna find is the
blood of<i> your</i> skate-rat twins,

471
00:27:45,433 --> 00:27:47,016
plus whatever piss and shit

472
00:27:47,051 --> 00:27:50,102
<i>you</i> leaked out when you were in there.

473
00:27:50,138 --> 00:27:54,523
Nobody's been in the
back of that van since.

474
00:27:54,559 --> 00:27:58,945

Here's what<i> I</i> understand, counselor.

476
00:28:03,985 --> 00:28:08,154
I told my plan to one other person.

477
00:28:08,156 --> 00:28:11,374
One... you.

478
00:28:11,409 --> 00:28:14,377
Now here I am, under arrest.

479
00:28:14,412 --> 00:28:16,379
- Go figure.
- [Sighs]

480
00:28:16,414 --> 00:28:19,382

You know what? I don't even care.

484
00:28:26,424 --> 00:28:29,392
The cops are out there right
now, poking into my business,

485
00:28:29,427 --> 00:28:34,230
and if they find something on me
or my partners, for real,

486
00:28:34,265 --> 00:28:38,684
it's gonna be bad for you... really bad.

487
00:28:40,521 --> 00:28:43,739
Bad? Bad as in...

488
00:28:43,775 --> 00:28:47,743
You get me out of here, today...

489
00:28:47,779 --> 00:28:50,112
Or you're a dead man.

Oh, hey.

493
00:29:14,166 --> 00:29:15,716
I asked if you knew anything.

494
00:29:15,765 --> 00:29:18,266
You didn't tell me you were
representing the lead suspect.

495
00:29:18,268 --> 00:29:19,817
I didn't know it at the time.

496
00:29:19,853 --> 00:29:21,269
Dunst: He give up anything?

497
00:29:21,271 --> 00:29:24,906
- What?
- Did he tell you where the family is?

498
00:29:24,941 --> 00:29:26,324
[Sighs] H... he doesn't know.

499
00:29:26,359 --> 00:29:27,942
What does that mean... he doesn't know?

500
00:29:27,944 --> 00:29:29,410
He gave them to somebody else?

501
00:29:29,445 --> 00:29:30,828
He... he doesn't know
because he didn't do it.

502
00:29:30,864 --> 00:29:32,163
Ah, Christ. Give me a break.

503
00:29:32,198 --> 00:29:34,749
Guys, can you give us just a minute?

504
00:29:37,754 --> 00:29:41,122
Jimmy, that family is in real danger.

505
00:29:41,124 --> 00:29:43,541
You don't have to stand behind
attorney-client privilege.

506
00:29:43,593 --> 00:29:44,659
I'm not.

507
00:29:44,745 --> 00:29:46,627
These people can be buried in a box,

508
00:29:46,629 --> 00:29:48,045
sucking air through a straw right now.

509
00:29:48,097 --> 00:29:49,881
And I'm sorry if that's where they are,

510
00:29:49,933 --> 00:29:51,299
but my guy didn't do it.

511
00:29:51,301 --> 00:29:53,718
How are you so sure?

512
00:29:53,770 --> 00:29:54,936
[Sighs]

513
00:29:54,971 --> 00:29:56,437
You know what you're gonna do?

514
00:29:56,472 --> 00:29:58,639
You're gonna get
your special CSI people, right?

515
00:29:58,641 --> 00:30:00,641
And you're gonna test the
blood from that van,

516
00:30:00,643 --> 00:30:02,476
because I guarantee you,
one billion percent,

517
00:30:02,478 --> 00:30:03,945
it's not the Kettlemans'.

518
00:30:03,980 --> 00:30:05,563
Whose is it?

519
00:30:05,615 --> 00:30:08,199
I... It's not the Kettlemans'. Just test it.

520
00:30:08,234 --> 00:30:09,817
That'll take weeks,

521
00:30:09,819 --> 00:30:11,819
if we could even get
a DNA sample to compare it to.

522
00:30:11,821 --> 00:30:14,539
Well, isn't that convenient?

523
00:30:14,574 --> 00:30:17,625
You've got an innocent man
in there right now,

524
00:30:17,660 --> 00:30:19,744
who I demand you release with an apology!

525
00:30:19,796 --> 00:30:21,829
Dunst: Look, there are no other suspects.

526
00:30:21,831 --> 00:30:24,665
There's no evidence
that points to anyone else.

527
00:30:24,667 --> 00:30:26,417
Well, then, I want to see the crime scene,

528
00:30:26,469 --> 00:30:28,052
'cause you guys are missing something.

529
00:30:28,068 --> 00:30:29,837
Screw you, "missing something."

530
00:30:29,839 --> 00:30:34,058
No, detectives, I, um...
I think that's a good idea.

531
00:30:34,093 --> 00:30:35,977
- A good idea?
- Yes.

532
00:30:36,012 --> 00:30:38,563
I think we should invite
Mr. McGill to the house.

533
00:30:38,598 --> 00:30:39,564
[Scoffs] Why?

534
00:30:39,599 --> 00:30:41,816
Yeah, why?

535
00:30:48,608 --> 00:30:50,575
So, what did we miss?

536
00:30:50,610 --> 00:30:52,610
[Clock ticking]

537
00:31:06,542 --> 00:31:09,543
[Sighs]

538
00:31:13,383 --> 00:31:17,802
This is the son's room...
Warren. 12 years old.

539
00:31:28,648 --> 00:31:31,866
[Sighs]

540
00:31:34,064 --> 00:31:37,238
Jo Jo's room.

541
00:31:37,240 --> 00:31:39,824
She's 7.

542
00:31:44,914 --> 00:31:48,883
[Sighs]

543
00:31:48,918 --> 00:31:51,085
All right, you wanted me to crack?

544
00:31:51,087 --> 00:31:53,087
Mission accomplished.

545
00:31:53,089 --> 00:31:55,723
But I'm telling you...
My client didn't do this.

546
00:31:55,758 --> 00:31:57,558
We know Varga was outside the house

547
00:31:57,593 --> 00:31:59,393
the night the family
disappeared. That is a fact.

548
00:31:59,429 --> 00:32:01,512
Advocate for the guy all you want

549
00:32:01,564 --> 00:32:03,931
after we get these people back safe.

550
00:32:03,933 --> 00:32:06,567
In the meantime, help us.

551
00:32:06,602 --> 00:32:08,319
Where's the doll?

552
00:32:08,354 --> 00:32:10,154
Where's the what?

553
00:32:10,189 --> 00:32:13,357
Uh, got little shoes, a bunch of clothes,

554
00:32:13,409 --> 00:32:14,992
a table and chairs, hairbrush,

555
00:32:15,028 --> 00:32:16,827
but where's the doll
that goes with all this stuff?

556
00:32:16,863 --> 00:32:18,663
In every picture of this little girl,

557
00:32:18,698 --> 00:32:20,197
she's holding the same doll.

558
00:32:20,249 --> 00:32:23,034
- So, where's the doll?
- What does it matter?

559
00:32:23,086 --> 00:32:25,252
Doll is gone... girl is gone,

560
00:32:25,288 --> 00:32:27,088
which means doll and girl
are most likely together,

561
00:32:27,123 --> 00:32:28,339
which means...

562
00:32:28,374 --> 00:32:29,840
I have no idea what that means.

563
00:32:29,876 --> 00:32:32,209
Which means the kid
wasn't dragged out of the house.

564
00:32:32,261 --> 00:32:34,178
- Ipso facto...
- Wait. Wait.

565
00:32:34,213 --> 00:32:36,013
What are you saying?

566
00:32:36,049 --> 00:32:39,884
Maybe the Kettlemans kidnapped themselves.

567
00:32:42,388 --> 00:32:44,972
That's it. You're...
You're... you're done. Let's go.

568
00:32:44,974 --> 00:32:47,108
- I... it makes perfect sense.
- How does it make sense?

569
00:32:47,143 --> 00:32:48,526
Why would they do that?

570
00:32:48,561 --> 00:32:51,612
They stole a million dollars-plus, right?

571
00:32:51,647 --> 00:32:53,230
You... you want to get away
with all that yummy cash,

572
00:32:53,282 --> 00:32:55,066
what do you do? Run? No, you can't.

573
00:32:55,118 --> 00:32:58,736
If you run, everyone knows
you're guilty. Ah!

574
00:32:58,788 --> 00:33:02,289
But if you're kidnapped,
you're a victim, right?

575
00:33:02,325 --> 00:33:04,492
They staged this to throw everyone off.

576
00:33:04,494 --> 00:33:06,994
[Scoffs] You guys are
looking in the wrong place.

577
00:33:06,996 --> 00:33:09,997
Who knows how many miles into
Mexico or Canada they could be?

578
00:33:09,999 --> 00:33:12,833
You... you got to put the word out.

579
00:33:12,835 --> 00:33:14,251
Oh, co... come on.

580
00:33:14,303 --> 00:33:16,554
You don't think it's possible I'm right?

581
00:33:16,589 --> 00:33:18,556
It's possible... unlikely.

582
00:33:18,591 --> 00:33:21,759
- Unlikely?
- All their cars are here.

583
00:33:21,811 --> 00:33:24,595
There's no record of a taxi
or car service to the house,

584
00:33:24,647 --> 00:33:27,398
and they didn't get on any
planes or buses or trains.

585
00:33:27,433 --> 00:33:29,350
- You checked all that?
- Yes, we checked it.

586
00:33:29,352 --> 00:33:32,103
And the doll... it's not news.
We saw it was missing.

587
00:33:32,155 --> 00:33:33,237
So where is it?

588
00:33:33,272 --> 00:33:35,072
The girl was scared, crying.

589
00:33:35,108 --> 00:33:37,108
Bad guy lets the kid
take the doll to shut her up.

590
00:33:37,160 --> 00:33:39,744
What?

591
00:33:39,779 --> 00:33:42,163
You don't think <i>that's</i> possible?

592
00:33:42,198 --> 00:33:47,001
I need to talk to you alone.

593
00:33:47,036 --> 00:33:49,620
I've got to tell you something on the Q.T.,

594
00:33:49,672 --> 00:33:51,038
and promise not to be upset with me.

595
00:33:51,040 --> 00:33:53,257
No way am I making that promise.

596
00:33:53,292 --> 00:33:54,875
I called the Kettlemans.

597
00:33:54,877 --> 00:33:56,710
After I hung up with you,
I gave them a warning call.

598
00:33:56,712 --> 00:33:58,462
A warning call?

599
00:33:58,514 --> 00:34:00,881
Yeah, I was worried my guy Varga
was going after their money.

600
00:34:00,883 --> 00:34:03,300
And he was. He was gonna rip them off.

601
00:34:03,352 --> 00:34:05,970
I deduced it from a
conversation that we had.

602
00:34:06,022 --> 00:34:07,555
It was lawyer to client,

603
00:34:07,557 --> 00:34:09,774
so there was, you know,
confidentiality issues.

604
00:34:09,809 --> 00:34:13,477
But I called the Kettlemans
anonymously to warn them.

605
00:34:13,529 --> 00:34:14,645
Anonymously?

606
00:34:14,697 --> 00:34:17,064
You didn't... oh, God, you didn't...

607
00:34:17,066 --> 00:34:18,699
You didn't do the sex-robot voice, did you?

608
00:34:18,734 --> 00:34:21,118
I did, with the tube and the whole thing,

609
00:34:21,154 --> 00:34:23,988
which probably scared
the living shit out of them,

610
00:34:24,040 --> 00:34:25,823
and they took off, which, you know,

611
00:34:25,875 --> 00:34:27,958
file that under "unintended consequences,"

612
00:34:27,994 --> 00:34:31,162
but you... you believe me now?

613
00:34:31,214 --> 00:34:33,798
- Uh...
- Great.

614
00:34:33,833 --> 00:34:35,416
Now we have to find them.

615
00:34:35,418 --> 00:34:40,254
I mean... or, better yet,
get the cops to let Varga go

616
00:34:40,256 --> 00:34:43,557
because right now my ass is
on a highway to the danger zone.

617
00:34:43,593 --> 00:34:44,925
Well, why are you in danger?

618
00:34:44,927 --> 00:34:47,812
Nacho Varga... he didn't kidnap the family.

619
00:34:47,847 --> 00:34:51,432
But he's a bad guy. He's a very bad guy.

620
00:34:51,434 --> 00:34:53,434
And if the cops keep pushing him,

621
00:34:53,436 --> 00:34:54,819
they're gonna find something.

622
00:34:54,854 --> 00:34:56,437
And when that happens, Nacho blames me,

623
00:34:56,439 --> 00:35:00,741
and then his guys turn me
into a meat piñata.

624
00:35:00,776 --> 00:35:02,493
Jimmy, tell the police.

625
00:35:02,528 --> 00:35:04,328
No, there's n... there's no way
I'm gonna rat on this guy.

626
00:35:04,363 --> 00:35:06,330
I will<i> never</i> be safe.

627
00:35:06,365 --> 00:35:08,782
No, I have to convince the cops
that I'm right,

628
00:35:08,784 --> 00:35:10,534
get them to stop looking at Nacho,

629
00:35:10,586 --> 00:35:12,336
and catch the Kettlemans on the run.

630
00:35:12,371 --> 00:35:13,871
And if they never catch them?

631
00:35:13,923 --> 00:35:15,706
The Kettlemans?

632
00:35:15,758 --> 00:35:17,258
Well, you've met these people, right?

633
00:35:17,293 --> 00:35:19,677
They're... they're not exactly
masterminds, right?

634
00:35:19,712 --> 00:35:22,096
They will be caught if the cops
are looking for them,

635
00:35:22,131 --> 00:35:24,098
so you tell them to, would you?

636
00:35:24,133 --> 00:35:26,300
The FBI, too... I heard
they're getting in on this.

637
00:35:26,302 --> 00:35:28,602
Why would the FBI listen to<i> me?</i>

638
00:35:28,638 --> 00:35:30,221
Well, Hamlin...
They'll listen to him, right?

639
00:35:30,273 --> 00:35:33,057
APD, at least. Y...
You... you talk to Howard.

640
00:35:33,109 --> 00:35:34,942
You explain things to him.

641
00:35:34,977 --> 00:35:36,527
He has clout with these people.

642
00:35:36,562 --> 00:35:38,062
What? Is... is that a no or...

643
00:35:38,114 --> 00:35:39,563
Hamlin will never agree to it.

644
00:35:39,615 --> 00:35:41,148
The Kettlemans are our clients.

645
00:35:41,150 --> 00:35:43,067
This would mean incriminating them.

646
00:35:43,119 --> 00:35:46,070
Oh, you... you see? This is why
people hate lawyers. [scoffs]

647
00:35:46,122 --> 00:35:49,490
It's Hamlin's call,
and Hamlin will never agree.

648
00:35:49,492 --> 00:35:53,327
And even if it were up to me,
you know I couldn't.

649
00:35:53,329 --> 00:35:55,546
I'm sorry. I just...

650
00:35:55,581 --> 00:35:57,414
I get it.

651
00:36:01,671 --> 00:36:03,053
Where are you going?

652
00:36:03,089 --> 00:36:04,672
I'm gonna go talk to Nacho.

653
00:36:04,674 --> 00:36:08,092
I'll try to make him see reason.

654
00:36:08,144 --> 00:36:10,895
To beg!

655
00:36:10,930 --> 00:36:14,765
[Brakes squeal]

656
00:36:14,817 --> 00:36:17,184
[Beep]

657
00:36:17,186 --> 00:36:18,652
Come on.

658
00:36:18,688 --> 00:36:20,771
Come on!

659
00:36:20,823 --> 00:36:23,407
[Button clicking]

660
00:36:23,442 --> 00:36:26,694
[Sniffs]

661
00:36:29,332 --> 00:36:33,117
Right. Yeah. Hey. [Clears throat]

662
00:36:33,169 --> 00:36:35,536
I was a jerk, okay?

663
00:36:35,538 --> 00:36:39,173
So, I will...
I will pay you what I owe you,

664
00:36:39,208 --> 00:36:41,625
plus interest,
if you just let me come through.

665
00:36:46,549 --> 00:36:49,967
I suggest you find parking somewhere else.

666
00:36:50,019 --> 00:36:52,386
Somewhere else, as in...
Where somewhere else?

667
00:36:52,388 --> 00:36:53,721
Not my concern.

668
00:36:53,723 --> 00:36:55,723
Uh, actually, uh, this is your job,

669
00:36:55,725 --> 00:36:57,725
so, by definition, it's your concern.

670
00:36:57,727 --> 00:37:01,946
So pump out the ticket and open
the stupid gate already, please.

671
00:37:01,981 --> 00:37:05,783
I mean, I don't have time for this.

672
00:37:05,818 --> 00:37:09,203
- [Horn honks]
- [Scoffs]

673
00:37:09,238 --> 00:37:12,406
All... [sighs]

674
00:37:12,408 --> 00:37:14,625
All right!

675
00:37:14,660 --> 00:37:17,411
[Horn honking]

676
00:37:17,413 --> 00:37:21,248
Hey. I'm gonna...
I'm gonna park right here.

677
00:37:21,250 --> 00:37:23,584
I don't think you want to be doing that.

678
00:37:23,586 --> 00:37:26,320
Oh, yeah?

679
00:37:26,355 --> 00:37:28,505
What are you gonna do? You got
a poop-filled diaper in there?

680
00:37:28,557 --> 00:37:30,341
Are you gonna throw it at me?

681
00:37:30,393 --> 00:37:33,594
You gonna gum me to death, huh, geezer?

682
00:37:33,596 --> 00:37:34,845
Ohh! Whoa, ow!

683
00:37:34,897 --> 00:37:37,264
Ow! Ow! Ow! Ohh! Ohh!

684
00:37:37,266 --> 00:37:38,649
Ow! Ow!

685
00:37:41,501 --> 00:37:43,919
We're talking about a family...
Mom, dad, two kids.

686
00:37:45,400 --> 00:37:47,566
Lawyer's got this bullshit theory

687
00:37:47,602 --> 00:37:50,186
about them staging this
and running off with the money.

688
00:37:50,238 --> 00:37:51,487
You know the story?

689
00:37:51,522 --> 00:37:53,105
Yeah, county treasurer embezzled funds.

690
00:37:53,107 --> 00:37:53,757
I read the paper.

691
00:37:53,806 --> 00:37:55,973
Yeah, well, we got this
gangbanger dead to rights.

692
00:37:56,025 --> 00:37:59,810
Only problem is your guy over there.

693
00:37:59,862 --> 00:38:03,230
He needs to help us get
his scumbag client to talk.

694
00:38:03,232 --> 00:38:05,483
So, what do you say? You on board?

695
00:38:05,535 --> 00:38:07,535
Help us do some good.

696
00:38:10,072 --> 00:38:11,455
Sure.

697
00:38:11,491 --> 00:38:13,073
Okay, here's the deal...
You assaulted this man.

698
00:38:13,075 --> 00:38:15,075
Give me a break. I barely touched the guy.

699
00:38:15,077 --> 00:38:16,911
But you laid hands on him first.

700
00:38:16,913 --> 00:38:19,411
<i>Finger...</i> I laid<i> finger</i> on him.

701
00:38:19,611 --> 00:38:21,444
Well, whatever your interpretation,

702
