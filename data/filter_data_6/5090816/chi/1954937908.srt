1
00:00:03,747 --> 00:00:05,213
嘿 Leonard...
Leonard...

2
00:00:05,215 --> 00:00:06,715
我有个坏消息
I've got terrible news.

3
00:00:06,717 --> 00:00:07,582
怎么回事?
What's going on?

4
00:00:07,584 --> 00:00:09,050
在我告诉你之前
Before I tell you,

5
00:00:09,052 --> 00:00:11,519
我觉得应该先铺垫一下
perhaps I should soften the blow.

6
00:00:11,521 --> 00:00:15,824
你的脸左右很对称
You're face is pleasingly symmetrical.

7
00:00:15,826 --> 00:00:18,026
就直接说吧
Just tell me.

8
00:00:18,028 --> 00:00:20,161
一队瑞典物理学家
A Swedish team of physicists

9
00:00:20,163 --> 00:00:23,031
准备抢在我们之前做超流体涡旋实验
is trying to scoop our super-fluid vortex experiment.

10
00:00:23,033 --> 00:00:25,133
啊 这有点糟啊
Oh, well, that kind of stinks.

11
00:00:25,135 --> 00:00:26,801
"这有点糟啊"?
"That kind of stinks"?

12
00:00:26,803 --> 00:00:28,603
你为什么没有很失望?
Why aren't you more upset?

13
00:00:28,605 --> 00:00:30,205
是我铺垫得太多了吗?
Did I soften the blow too much?

14
00:00:30,207 --> 00:00:34,643
因为你看起来更像毕加索的抽象画
Because this here is more like a Picasso painting.

15
00:00:34,645 --> 00:00:37,012
我们要怎么办?
What are we going to do?

16
00:00:37,014 --> 00:00:38,513
马上开始实验
Perform the experiment immediately.

17
00:00:38,515 --> 00:00:40,415
我也想啊 但我们需要液氦
I'd love to, but we need liquid helium

18
00:00:40,417 --> 00:00:42,951
我们的订单已经延期交货一个月了
and our shipment's on back order for a month.

19
00:00:42,953 --> 00:00:45,020
一个月? 你逗我呢?
A month? What? Are you kidding me?

20
00:00:45,022 --> 00:00:47,889
这么长时间足够你铺垫了啊
That would have been a good time for you to soften the blow.

21
00:00:47,891 --> 00:00:51,326
你的T恤很衬你的蓝眼睛
That shirt brings out the blue in your eyes.

22
00:00:51,328 --> 00:00:53,728
谢谢 你嘴真甜
Thank you. Aren't you sweet.

23
00:00:53,730 --> 00:00:55,764
我们去看看大学里还有没有
Let's go check to see if the university

24
00:00:55,766 --> 00:00:57,999
液氦存货了
has any helium in reserve.

25
00:00:58,001 --> 00:01:01,403
你知道我今天差点就没穿这件T恤吗?
Did you know that I almost didn't wear this shirt today?

26
00:01:02,572 --> 00:01:04,439
嘿 Barry 我们碰上麻烦了
Hey, Barry, we're in trouble.

27
00:01:04,441 --> 00:01:07,208
我们需要液氦... 系里面还有库存吗?
We need liquid helium... Does the department have any we can use?

28
00:01:07,210 --> 00:01:08,576
不好意思 液氦不是很充足
Sorry, there's a shortage.

29
00:01:08,578 --> 00:01:11,212
剩下的那些 我要拿来做量子激发研究
And what we do have I need for my quantum excitation study.

30
00:01:11,214 --> 00:01:13,381
但你用不了那么多啊
But you won't need much for that.

31
00:01:13,383 --> 00:01:14,749
对 但如果成功了
True, but if it's successful,

32
00:01:14,751 --> 00:01:17,385
我要拿它给气球充气开派对
I'm having a party with balloons.

33
00:01:17,387 --> 00:01:19,387
别这样 Barry 有一个瑞典团队
Come on, Barry, there's a Swedish team

34
00:01:19,389 --> 00:01:21,022
准备在我们之前做实验呢
trying to run our experiment before us.

35
00:01:21,024 --> 00:01:22,190
能分点给我们吗?
Can't you spare any?

36
00:01:22,192 --> 00:01:24,893
说心里话 如果情况刚好相反
Be honest, if the shoe was on the other foot,

37
00:01:24,895 --> 00:01:27,062
你会借我液氦吗?
would you do this for me?

38
00:01:27,064 --> 00:01:29,564
- 当然  - 没门
- Yes.  - No chance.

39
00:01:29,566 --> 00:01:31,299
你干什么呢?
What are you doing?

40
00:01:31,301 --> 00:01:33,068
他说讲心里话 我就如实说了
He said be honest, so I was honest.

41
00:01:33,070 --> 00:01:35,503
你妈妈没教过你吗? 这是最好的方案
Didn't your mother tell you? It's the best policy.

42
00:01:35,505 --> 00:01:37,305
所以你怎么想?
So, what do you say?

43
00:01:37,307 --> 00:01:38,406
当然不借
Hell no.

44
00:01:40,510 --> 00:01:43,978
他应该做些铺垫的
He could've softened the blow.

为什么不去派对城买氦气?
Why don't you just go to Party City for helium?

62
00:02:23,472 --> 00:02:26,640
嘿 人们五月七号还在谈论
Hey, people were still talking about that party

63
00:02:26,642 --> 00:02:29,409
那个派对呢
on siete de Mayo.

64
00:02:30,980 --> 00:02:32,179
Leonard 如果个瑞典团队打败了我们
Leonard, if that Swedish team beats us,

65
00:02:32,181 --> 00:02:33,347
我就永远不会喜欢
I will never be able to enjoy

66
00:02:33,349 --> 00:02:34,881
任何他们国家出产的东西了
anything from their country again.

67
00:02:34,883 --> 00:02:36,783
真是可惜 因为瑞典的肉丸
Which is a shame, because Swedish meatballs

68
00:02:36,785 --> 00:02:41,121
是我最喜欢的牙签肉丸
are my favorite toothpick-delivered meatball.

69
00:02:41,123 --> 00:02:44,524
如果你们真的很需要液氦的话 我认识一个人
If you need liquid helium so bad, I know a guy

70
00:02:44,526 --> 00:02:47,060
只要你不问太多问题 他会给你们弄一些的
who can get you some, if you don't ask too many questions.

71
00:02:47,062 --> 00:02:48,228
- 他是谁?  - 他在什么地方工作?
- Who is he?  - Where does he work?

72
00:02:48,230 --> 00:02:49,629
他怎么能弄到氦气?
How does he get the helium?

73
00:02:49,631 --> 00:02:51,465
多少问题才算多?
How many questions are too many questions?

74
00:02:51,467 --> 00:02:53,266
他大概不会给你了
Maybe he's not for you.

75
00:02:53,268 --> 00:02:56,236
四个问题 四个问题才算多
Four questions. There answer's four.

76
00:02:57,406 --> 00:02:58,605
嘿 你知道那天晚上
Hey, you know who went out

77
00:02:58,607 --> 00:03:00,107
谁出去约会了吗? 是Stuart
on a date the other night? Stuart.

78
00:03:00,109 --> 00:03:01,274
哦 不错啊
Oh, good for him.

79
00:03:01,276 --> 00:03:02,542
我也这么想
I thought so, too.

80
00:03:02,544 --> 00:03:07,014
她是个无家可归的人 还是准备作伪证陷害Stuart?
So is she, like, homeless, or framing him for a crime?

81
00:03:07,016 --> 00:03:09,816
他在手机上用一个什么约会软件
He's using some kind of dating app on his phone.

82
00:03:09,818 --> 00:03:11,251
哪一个?
Oh, which one?

83
00:03:11,253 --> 00:03:12,486
大概我们可以让Amy试试
Maybe we can get Amy to try it.

84
00:03:12,488 --> 00:03:14,488
我不知道
I don't know.

85
00:03:14,490 --> 00:03:16,056
Stuart 你能来一下吗?
Stuart, can you come in here?

86
00:03:16,058 --> 00:03:17,758
他给我解释过这个
He tried to explain it to me.

87
00:03:17,760 --> 00:03:19,493
它会显示你周围人的照片
It shows you pictures of people nearby,

88
00:03:19,495 --> 00:03:22,896
你可以划来划去 看起来像个游戏
you swipe them around, it looks kind of like a game.

89
00:03:22,898 --> 00:03:26,500
哦 那如果你输了的话 就要和Stuart约会吧
Oh, and if you lose the game, you have to go out with Stuart.

90
00:03:28,871 --> 00:03:29,870
什么事?
What's up?

91
00:03:29,872 --> 00:03:32,105
你能给我们看看那个约会软件吗?
Can you show us that dating app?

92
00:03:32,107 --> 00:03:33,740
哦 当然
Oh, yeah, sure.

93
00:03:33,742 --> 00:03:36,576
这软件简直改变了我的人生
This thing has changed my life.

94
00:03:36,578 --> 00:03:38,011
哇 你已经约过多少女孩了?
Wow. So how many girls have you met?

95
00:03:38,013 --> 00:03:39,679
两个
Two.

96
00:03:40,616 --> 00:03:41,782
我不用解释
I probably don't need to mention

97
00:03:41,784 --> 00:03:44,885
2和0之间还有一个整数吧
there's an entire number between that and zero.

98
00:03:44,887 --> 00:03:46,520
那它是怎么约女孩的?
Well, so how does it work?

99
00:03:46,522 --> 00:03:48,955
嗯 它会显示
Uh, well, it-it shows me all

100
00:03:48,957 --> 00:03:51,258
我方圆五英里内所有正在使用
the single women in a five-mile radius

101
00:03:51,260 --> 00:03:52,692
这款软件的单身女性
who are using the app.

102
00:03:52,694 --> 00:03:55,128
如果我喜欢她们 我就会点"顶"
If I like the way they look, I hit "thumbs up."

103
00:03:55,130 --> 00:03:57,030
如果不喜欢 就点"踩"
If I don't, "thumbs down."

104
00:03:57,032 --> 00:03:58,932
哦 那什么情况下你会"踩"一个女孩?
Oh, what would make you give a girl a thumbs down?

105
00:03:58,934 --> 00:04:03,437
等我第一次点的时候 我会告诉你的
First time it happens I will let you know.

106
00:04:04,606 --> 00:04:08,275
嘿 那个卖液氦的人回复我了
Oh, hey. I just heard back from the liquid helium guy.

107
00:04:08,277 --> 00:04:10,077
他说什么?
What's he say?

108
00:04:10,079 --> 00:04:12,813
他有我们想要的东西 想今晚见我们
He's got what we need and can meet us tonight.

109
00:04:12,815 --> 00:04:15,148
要这样吗?
Oh, really?

110
00:04:15,150 --> 00:04:17,551
你知道我不喜欢晚上买东西
You know I don't like buying things at night.

111
00:04:18,754 --> 00:04:20,087
2009年一月七号
January 7, 2009.

112
00:04:20,089 --> 00:04:22,456
晚上11点半我去Ralph那里取我的
I went to the Ralph's at 11:30pm to pick up

113
00:04:22,458 --> 00:04:24,591
早餐脆皮麦片 我看到了什么?
Cracklin' Oat Bran for the morning and what did I see?

114
00:04:24,593 --> 00:04:26,126
一个男人正在给麦片货架上货
The man restocking the cereal shelves.

115
00:04:26,128 --> 00:04:27,627
没错 他做了什么?
That's right. And what did he do?

116
00:04:27,629 --> 00:04:31,631
他直接给了你一盒 还叫你瘦竹竿
He handed you the box directly and called you Stretch.

117
00:04:33,602 --> 00:04:36,303
简直就像刚发生一样
It's like it was yesterday.

118
00:04:36,305 --> 00:04:38,572
你到底想不想要液氮?
Do you want liquid helium or not?

119
00:04:38,574 --> 00:04:39,739
我当然想要
Of course I do.

120
00:04:39,741 --> 00:04:41,675
我不想让瑞典小组抢先
I don't want that Swedish team scooping us.

121
00:04:41,677 --> 00:04:43,477
那我就跟他说同意见面了
Then I'm going to tell him we're in.

122
00:04:43,479 --> 00:04:46,646
等下 Leonard 这很不道德
Leonard, wait. This is highly unethical.

123
00:04:46,648 --> 00:04:48,381
我们只是稍微改变了一下规则
We're just bending the rules a little.

124
00:04:48,383 --> 00:04:50,484
我们有很多资金做实验
We have grant money to do the experiment,

125
00:04:50,486 --> 00:04:53,186
我们就把钱花在我们需要的液氮上
so we're going to spend it on the helium we need.

126
00:04:53,188 --> 00:04:54,654
这个和Goldfarb博士不一样
It's not like when Dr. Goldfarb

127
00:04:54,656 --> 00:04:56,756
他声称自己买了电子显微镜
claimed he bought an electron microscope

128
00:04:56,758 --> 00:04:58,058
实际上只是拿钱去和
and he was really just keeping

129
00:04:58,060 --> 00:05:01,795
俄罗斯女孩在Van Nuys同居
a Russian girl in an apartment in Van Nuys.

130
00:05:01,797 --> 00:05:06,399
她在帮他做实验吗?
Was she helping him with his research?

131
00:05:08,504 --> 00:05:09,903
是
Sure.

132
00:05:10,906 --> 00:05:12,239
所以我们到底见不见?
So, are we doing this?

133
00:05:12,241 --> 00:05:14,274
好吧 但他是哪里弄到液氮的?
Okay, but where does he get the helium?

134
00:05:14,276 --> 00:05:16,009
记得吗? 别问太多问题
Remember? Don't ask too many questions?

135
00:05:16,011 --> 00:05:18,512
呃 但这违反了学校的规定
Uh, but this is violating university code.

136
00:05:18,514 --> 00:05:20,347
一点点 但是...
A little, but... 

137
00:05:20,349 --> 00:05:21,948
但是爱因斯坦说过
if I may quote Einstein,

138
00:05:21,950 --> 00:05:24,084
"对科学的追求让我们
"The pursuit of science calls us

139
00:05:24,086 --> 00:05:26,887
忽视一切人为的规则"
to ignore the rules set by man"
135 

140
00:05:26,889 --> 00:05:28,722
对哦
Huh.

141
00:05:28,724 --> 00:05:29,990
好吧 干吧
All right, do it.

142
00:05:29,992 --> 00:05:31,358
跟他说我们交易
Tell him we're in.

143
00:05:33,028 --> 00:05:35,295
成了
Done.

144
00:05:35,297 --> 00:05:37,297
网上找不到这话
I can't find that quote on the Internet.

145
00:05:37,299 --> 00:05:39,432
是你自己编的吧?
Did you make that up?

146
00:05:41,803 --> 00:05:43,203
在我回答之前
Before I answer,

147
00:05:43,205 --> 00:05:46,373
我想说你现在的皮肤真是棒呆了
may I just say your skin has never looked better.

148
00:05:48,911 --> 00:05:51,311
你嘴可真甜
Aren't you just made of sugar.

149
00:05:53,916 --> 00:05:56,183
我觉得这很诡异
I'm not sure how I feel about this.

150
00:05:56,185 --> 00:05:57,717
没事的 就是让他给你的手机装个软件而已
Oh, come on, just let him put the app on your phone.

151
00:05:57,719 --> 00:05:59,519
是啊 Stuart用它约了两次会了
Yeah, Stuart got two dates with it.

152
00:05:59,521 --> 00:06:03,323
其中一个本来可以滚床单的 她没说不行
One of which would've ended in sex had she not said no.

153
00:06:04,593 --> 00:06:06,359
好了 装好了
Okay, all set.

154
00:06:06,361 --> 00:06:07,794
好 让我看看
Okay, let me see.

155
00:06:07,796 --> 00:06:09,563
这个不行 不行
Nope, nope,

156
00:06:09,565 --> 00:06:11,464
也不行...
nope...

157
00:06:11,466 --> 00:06:12,832
这个很棒!
Oh, he's cute!

158
00:06:12,834 --> 00:06:14,434
这个泪珠一样的纹身
Doesn't a teardrop tattoo

159
00:06:14,436 --> 00:06:17,504
是不是代表他谋杀过什么人?
mean he murdered someone?

160
00:06:17,506 --> 00:06:20,373
他还为此很难过
And he's sad about it.

161
00:06:20,375 --> 00:06:22,742
- 嗨  - 大家好
- Hey.  - Hello.

162
00:06:22,744 --> 00:06:24,945
- 嘿  - 嘿 我以为你们会玩到很晚呢
- Hey.  - Hey, I thought you were gonna be out late?

163
00:06:24,947 --> 00:06:26,313
你要是想让我晚回来
If you wanted me to stay out later,

164
00:06:26,315 --> 00:06:28,815
你应该多给一些零用钱
you should've given me more spending money.

165
00:06:29,785 --> 00:06:30,917
你们在干什么啊?
What are you guys up to?

166
00:06:30,919 --> 00:06:32,085
我们给Amy装了一个约会软件
We put Amy on a dating app,

167
00:06:32,087 --> 00:06:33,320
我们正在看里面都有什么
and we're seeing what's out there.

168
00:06:33,322 --> 00:06:35,088
有趣! 让我也看看
Oh, fun! Let me see.

169
00:06:35,090 --> 00:06:37,123
呃 这个不行...
Uh, no...

170
00:06:37,125 --> 00:06:39,993
不行 这个肯定不行
no, uh, definitely not.

171
00:06:39,995 --> 00:06:42,128
这人怎么了?
What was wrong with that guy?

172
00:06:42,130 --> 00:06:43,496
呃 他是印度人
Uh, he's Indian.

173
00:06:43,498 --> 00:06:45,699
我们已经有一个印度人了
We've already got one of those.

174
00:06:47,135 --> 00:06:48,702
哦 我们应该找一个拉美人
Ooh, we should find a nice Latino.

175
00:06:48,704 --> 00:06:51,304
我们正缺这个品种
It really round us out.

176
00:06:51,306 --> 00:06:52,539
嘿 我也要试一试
Hey, I want to try.

177
00:06:52,541 --> 00:06:53,774
呃 打扰一下... 我能把手机拿回来吗?
Uh, excuse me, c... can I have my phone back?

178
00:06:53,776 --> 00:06:54,909
等一会 我正在帮你找
Hang on, I'm trying to find you

179
00:06:54,911 --> 00:06:57,510
你的下一任真爱呢
the next great love of your life.

180
00:06:57,512 --> 00:06:58,679
这人会成为你孩子的父亲
The man who will father your children.

181
00:06:58,681 --> 00:07:00,814
快看 这个编着小辫子的白人怎么样?
Okay, yes or no on white guy with dreadlocks?

182
00:07:10,692 --> 00:07:12,926
那应该就是他了
That must be him.

183
00:07:12,928 --> 00:07:14,761
当然
Oh, of course.

184
00:07:14,763 --> 00:07:17,097
一辆没有任何特点的白面包车
An nondescript, white panel van.

185
00:07:17,099 --> 00:07:19,199
你应该对这句话很熟吧:
You may be familiar with it from the sentence:

186
00:07:19,201 --> 00:07:23,703
"他们的尸体在一辆没有任何特点的白面包车里被发现"
"Their bodies were found in a nondescript, white panel van"

187
00:07:29,411 --> 00:07:31,011
嘿
Hey.

188
00:07:31,013 --> 00:07:32,078
怎么了?
What's up?

189
00:07:32,080 --> 00:07:33,113
我是Leonard
Uh, I'm Leonard.

190
00:07:33,115 --> 00:07:34,514
- 这是我朋友...  - 我是Skippy
- This is my friend...  - I'm Skippy.

191
00:07:34,516 --> 00:07:36,216
全名Skippy Cavanaugh
Skippy Cavanaugh.

192
00:07:36,218 --> 00:07:38,418
好吧
Great.

193
00:07:38,420 --> 00:07:39,552
你们带现金了吗?
You got the cash?

194
00:07:39,554 --> 00:07:40,787
呃 带了 在这儿
Uh, yeah, uh, right here.

195
00:07:40,789 --> 00:07:42,289
等一下 等等
Wait, hold on, hold on.

196
00:07:42,291 --> 00:07:43,723
我们怎知道你会不会
How do we know that you're not gonna

197
00:07:43,725 --> 00:07:45,558
拿了钱就马上跑路?
take the money and drive away?

198
00:07:45,560 --> 00:07:48,295
Skippy 你干嘛?
What ya doing, Skippy?

199
00:07:48,297 --> 00:07:50,897
这是70年代的罪案剧教我们的
Exactly what 1970s television crime dramas have taught us.

200
00:07:50,899 --> 00:07:54,534
你先把液氮交出来
You give us the helium first.

201
00:07:54,536 --> 00:07:56,403
呃 我怎么知道你们不会
Oh, how do I know you're not gonna

202
00:07:56,405 --> 00:07:57,737
拿上液氮就跑了?
drive away without paying me?

203
00:07:57,739 --> 00:07:59,739
我想我不是唯一一个
Guess I'm not the only one

204
00:07:59,741 --> 00:08:01,741
看过70年代罪案剧的人
who watches '70s television crime dramas.

205
00:08:02,577 --> 00:08:03,977
听着 你可以相信我们
Look, you can trust us.

206
00:08:03,979 --> 00:08:06,079
我们都是有名的科学家
We're respected scientists.

207
00:08:06,081 --> 00:08:07,447
呃 他是科学家
Well, he is.

208
00:08:07,449 --> 00:08:09,316
我是个找不到真爱的
I'm a wedding planner,

209
00:08:09,318 --> 00:08:11,918
婚礼策划师
who can't find love himself.

210
00:08:13,355 --> 00:08:15,522
这是讽刺 但重点是
It's ironic, but the point is

211
00:08:15,524 --> 00:08:17,057
我们不能信任你
we can't trust you.

212
00:08:17,059 --> 00:08:20,293
你是车库里一个毫无特点的人
You're a sketchy character in a parking garage.

213
00:08:20,295 --> 00:08:21,761
呃 好吧 在我看来
Yeah, well, from my perspective,

214
00:08:21,763 --> 00:08:23,263
这也是你们给我的印象
that's how you two appear to me.

215
00:08:23,265 --> 00:08:26,533
好吧 我从没想过会这样子
Well, I never thought of it like that.

216
00:08:26,535 --> 00:08:30,036
小子 参照系会慢慢移到你那边的 是吧?
Boy, frame of reference will just sneak up on you, won't it?

217
00:08:31,206 --> 00:08:33,106
我朋友对付钱是很有诚意的
My friend does make a decent point about the money.

218
00:08:33,108 --> 00:08:35,475
我觉得直接把钱交给你不合适
I don't feel comfortable just handing it over up front.

219
00:08:35,477 --> 00:08:37,777
呃... 没钱 没液氮
Ah..ah...ah, no money, no helium.

220
00:08:37,779 --> 00:08:41,181
看来我们陷入僵局了
Seems we're at a, uh, stalemate.

221
00:08:41,183 --> 00:08:42,816
这么说不准确
Not technically.

222
00:08:42,818 --> 00:08:44,851
在国际象棋里 僵局是指任何一个子
In chess, a stalemate refers to a situation

223
00:08:44,853 --> 00:08:46,886
都已经没有步可以走了 
in which there are no remaining moves.

224
00:08:46,888 --> 00:08:48,988
呃 你还有很多步可以走
Uh, you have plenty of moves available.

225
00:08:48,990 --> 00:08:51,391
你可以放倒我们再把钱偷走
You could beat us up and steal the money.

226
00:08:52,361 --> 00:08:54,661
也可以杀了我们 你懂的
You could kill us, you know.

227
00:08:54,663 --> 00:08:58,798
说真的 唯一限制你行动的就是你的想象力
Really, you're only limited by your imagination.

228
00:09:00,135 --> 00:09:01,368
呃
Huh.

229
00:09:01,370 --> 00:09:03,069
这么些年 我说"僵局"的时候
All these years, I've been using "stalemate",

230
00:09:03,071 --> 00:09:05,138
我仅仅是指"僵局"而已
when I really mean “impasse”.

231
00:09:05,140 --> 00:09:07,674
我好像犯蠢了
I feel foolish.

232
00:09:09,911 --> 00:09:12,445
我觉得不管这是无路可走
I don't think it matters if this is a stalemate

233
00:09:12,447 --> 00:09:14,814
还是个僵局 还是什么墨西哥对峙
or an impasse or a Mexican standoff.

234
00:09:14,816 --> 00:09:16,049
我们到底怎么交易?
What are we gonna do here?

235
00:09:16,051 --> 00:09:17,784
等等 等等 这怎么能是墨西哥对峙?
Oh, whoa, whoa, how can it be a Mexican standoff?

236
00:09:17,786 --> 00:09:20,453
大家都知道 墨西哥对峙至少需要三方的参与
Everybody knows you need three sides for that.

237
00:09:20,455 --> 00:09:21,988
不一定啊
Not necessarily.

238
00:09:21,990 --> 00:09:24,391
很多人说 墨西哥对峙的重点在于
Uh, many argue the essence of a Mexican standoff

239
00:09:24,393 --> 00:09:26,659
没有人能够不受到任何伤害
is that no one can walk away from the conflict

240
00:09:26,661 --> 00:09:28,762
而走出当前的处境
without incurring harm.

241
00:09:28,764 --> 00:09:31,498
我没明白
Hmm, I don't follow.

242
00:09:31,500 --> 00:09:33,266
举个例子来说
Let me give you an example.

243
00:09:33,268 --> 00:09:35,835
今天早些时候
Earlier today,

244
00:09:35,837 --> 00:09:37,670
我分析了你发来的邮件的页眉
I decoded the headers on your e-mail,

245
00:09:37,672 --> 00:09:39,906
发现你叫Kenneth Fitzgerald
and I know that your name is Kenneth Fitzgerald.

246
00:09:39,908 --> 00:09:42,609
通过你的名字 我进一步找到了你的住址和工作单位
From that, I figured out where you live and where you work.

247
00:09:42,611 --> 00:09:45,011
那么 如果要构成一个墨西哥对峙的局面
Now, to make this a Mexican standoff,

248
00:09:45,013 --> 00:09:46,780
我就会说 比如 呃
I would say something like, uh,

249
00:09:46,782 --> 00:09:50,383
"你要是不把液氦给我们 我们就报警"
"You give us the helium or I'll turn you in to the authorities"

250
00:09:50,385 --> 00:09:51,818
这是在威胁我?
Is that a threat?

251
00:09:51,820 --> 00:09:54,154
对啊 没错 你懂了吧
Yeah, exactly. See, you're getting it.

252
00:09:54,156 --> 00:09:56,923
好吧 知道吗? 我也知道你们在哪工作 
Yeah, well, I know where you work, all right?

253
00:09:56,925 --> 00:09:58,725
要是你们敢找我的麻烦 我也会把你们的事抖出来
And if you mess with me, I'll report you,

254
00:09:58,727 --> 00:10:00,627
然后再狠狠揍你们一顿
then I'll pound your asses into the ground.

255
00:10:00,629 --> 00:10:03,530
这就对了! 现在我们的处境就属于墨西哥对峙
Perfect! Now we really are in a Mexican standoff.

256
00:10:05,400 --> 00:10:07,167
这是不是就是那种
Is this one of those times

257
00:10:07,169 --> 00:10:10,336
捡了芝麻 丢了西瓜的情况?
where I've won the battle but lost the war?

258
00:10:10,338 --> 00:10:13,640
好像是吧 Skippy
Afraid so, Skippy.

259
00:10:13,642 --> 00:10:16,376
我就跟你说我们不应该晚上出来买东西
I told you we shouldn't go shopping at night.

260
00:10:24,927 --> 00:10:26,961
好了 好了 大家都冷静点
All right, let's all just calm down.

261
00:10:26,963 --> 00:10:28,662
没人想报警
Nobody wants to report anybody.

262
00:10:28,664 --> 00:10:30,030
不 我不喜欢这种感觉 我不干了
No, I don't like this. I'm out.

263
00:10:30,032 --> 00:10:31,799
别 别 别 等一下 先别走
No, no, no. Wait, don't go.

264
00:10:31,801 --> 00:10:33,067
你让我解释一下
Just let me explain.

265
00:10:33,069 --> 00:10:35,102
我们是物理学家 我们已经花了一年的时间
We're physicists, and we're trying to prove

266
00:10:35,104 --> 00:10:37,838
想要证明我们提出的一个假设
a hypothesis that we've been working on for over a year.

267
00:10:37,840 --> 00:10:41,208
是吗? 什么假设?
Really? What's the hypothesis?

268
00:10:41,210 --> 00:10:43,143
时间和空间可以被解释为
Space-time can be interpreted as

269
00:10:43,145 --> 00:10:45,613
多面超流体的一个表面
the surface of an n-dimensional superfluid.

270
00:10:45,615 --> 00:10:47,281
嗯 有可能 有可能
Hmm. Could be, could be.

271
00:10:47,283 --> 00:10:49,049
所以呢
Go on.

272
00:10:50,853 --> 00:10:53,420
现在有一个瑞典的科研团队 他们读了我们的论文
Okay, but now there's this Swedish team that read our paper

273
00:10:53,422 --> 00:10:55,923
就想抢在我们前面发表实验成果
and they're trying to beat us to our own discovery.

274
00:10:56,859 --> 00:10:58,158
我们真的很需要这些液氦
We really need this helium.

275
00:10:58,160 --> 00:10:59,460
我也很抱歉 我骗你说
And I'm sorry I lied about

276
00:10:59,462 --> 00:11:01,862
我是找不到真爱的婚礼策划师
being a wedding planner who can't find love.

277
00:11:01,864 --> 00:11:04,898
不过我现在真的单身 万一你有认识的合适的女孩...
Although I am currently single, if you know anybody.

278
00:11:06,002 --> 00:11:07,835
钱给你 现在可以了吗?
Here's the money. Can we do this?

279
00:11:07,837 --> 00:11:10,104
好吧
Okay.

280
00:11:11,574 --> 00:11:13,674
真为那些窃取你们研究成果的科学家感到丢人
It's a shame about those scientists ripping you off.

281
00:11:13,676 --> 00:11:15,542
我还以为瑞典的小伙伴们
I expected a higher ethical standard

282
00:11:15,544 --> 00:11:17,444
道德水准挺高的呢
from our friends in Sweden.

283
00:11:19,115 --> 00:11:21,148
其实在我们这个领域这种事情挺常见的
It's actually pretty common in our field.

284
00:11:21,150 --> 00:11:22,750
但也没什么办法
Not much you can do about it.

285
00:11:22,752 --> 00:11:24,251
其实 只要有足够的钱
Well, for the right amount of money,

286
00:11:24,253 --> 00:11:25,452
并且知道他们住在那里
if you know where they live,

287
00:11:25,454 --> 00:11:26,854
那还是有挺多办法对付他们的
there's, uh, plenty we could do about it.

288
00:11:26,856 --> 00:11:28,822
你听见了吗 Leonard?
Did you hear that, Leonard?

289
00:11:28,824 --> 00:11:31,458
我们有挺多办法的
There's plenty we could do about it.

290
00:11:32,395 --> 00:11:35,362
你有名片吗?
Do you have a card?

291
00:11:36,532 --> 00:11:38,866
好了 连好了
Okay, here we go.

292
00:11:38,868 --> 00:11:40,067
这样大家都能看到了
Now everyone can see.

293
00:11:40,069 --> 00:11:41,201
好了
All right.

294
00:11:41,203 --> 00:11:43,570
你们觉得这个有点内斜视的Mike怎么样?
Where do we stand on cross-eyed Mike?

295
00:11:45,107 --> 00:11:48,809
这样他就没法看别的女孩了
You know he won't be looking at other girls.

296
00:11:51,847 --> 00:11:54,782
除非她们坐在他的鼻子上
Unless they're sitting on the end of his nose.

297
00:11:55,551 --> 00:11:57,685
好了好了 不喜欢
Okay, okay, okay. Thumbs down.

298
00:11:57,687 --> 00:11:59,253
下一位
Next.

299
00:11:59,255 --> 00:12:01,255
哦 看他的牙那么小
Ew, check out his tiny teeth.

300
00:12:01,257 --> 00:12:03,490
他看起来就像只海豚
He looks like a man-dolphin.

301
00:12:04,593 --> 00:12:07,394
那要是他活儿好的话 Amy可以奖励他一条鱼
Wait, if he's good in bed, she can throw him a fish.

302
00:12:08,798 --> 00:12:10,197
我爱你 Amy
I love you, Amy.

303
00:12:16,138 --> 00:12:18,405
你们差不多就算了吧 我感觉有点自责
Okay, I'm starting to feel guilty.

304
00:12:18,407 --> 00:12:20,641
我们这样是不是不太好啊?
Aren't we being a little mean?

305
00:12:21,977 --> 00:12:23,877
说得对
That's a fair point.

306
00:12:23,879 --> 00:12:26,647
当着别人的面 我们肯定不会这么取笑他们
We wouldn't make fun of someone like this to their face.

307
00:12:27,483 --> 00:12:29,850
看啊 是Stuart!
Look, it's Stuart!

308
00:12:32,321 --> 00:12:35,089
你可以选择不要待在这间屋子里了
You may want to leave the room.

309
00:12:39,128 --> 00:12:42,329
往这边走 Harvey叔叔
Right this way, Uncle Harvey.

310
00:12:47,069 --> 00:12:49,069
你能别这么干了吗?
Will you stop with that already?

311
00:12:49,071 --> 00:12:52,372
我不想太引人注意
I'm trying not to attract attention.

312
00:12:52,374 --> 00:12:55,442
向清洁女工脱帽致意不会引人注意吗?
And tipping his hat to the cleaning lady didn't do that?

313
00:12:55,444 --> 00:12:59,012
她说了西班牙语的"晚上好" Harvey叔叔还能怎么样?
She said, "Buenas noches." What was he supposed to do?

314
00:12:59,014 --> 00:13:00,981
赶紧做实验吧
Let's just start the experiment.

315
00:13:00,983 --> 00:13:02,916
Leonard 我们得先编好供词
Leonard, we should probably have our story straight

316
00:13:02,918 --> 00:13:04,284
万一被抓了也好有个对策
in case we get caught.

317
00:13:04,286 --> 00:13:06,053
我们不会被抓的
We're not getting caught.

318
00:13:06,055 --> 00:13:07,154
谁也说不准嘛
Well, you can't be sure of that.

319
00:13:07,156 --> 00:13:09,189
万一那个卖液氦的人出卖了我们呢?
What if the helium dealer rats us out?

320
00:13:09,191 --> 00:13:11,325
万一Kripke问我们液氦的来源呢?
What if Kripke asks where we got it?

321
00:13:11,327 --> 00:13:13,227
万一学校去检查我的家谱
What if the university checks my family tree

322
00:13:13,229 --> 00:13:15,829
发现我没有一个叔叔叫Harvey呢?
and finds out I don't have an Uncle Harvey?

323
00:13:15,831 --> 00:13:19,133
卖液氦的人才懒得管我们 Kripke没有权利管我们
The dealer doesn't care, Kripke has no authority over us,

324
00:13:19,135 --> 00:13:21,001
而你和一个金属罐子的亲属关系
and you being related to a metal container

325
00:13:21,003 --> 00:13:24,004
就可以解释Harvey叔叔的事了
would explain a lot.

326
00:13:24,006 --> 00:13:27,374
帮我把这个连上
Help me hook this up.

327
00:13:27,376 --> 00:13:28,575
- 啊哦  - 怎么了?
- Uh-oh.  - What?

328
00:13:28,577 --> 00:13:30,677
- 你看到这个标签了吗?  - 写了什么?
- Well, did you see this sticker?  - What is it?

329
00:13:30,679 --> 00:13:33,280
已经被撕掉了一部分 不过剩下的部分写着
It's partially torn off, but the segment that remains reads:

330
00:13:33,282 --> 00:13:36,083
"归属权为" 还有字母"U"
"Property of" and the letter "U."

331
00:13:36,085 --> 00:13:37,918
有可能代表南加州大学或者加州大学洛杉矶分校
It's probably USC or UCLA.

332
00:13:37,920 --> 00:13:40,487
是啊 不过万一是"归属权为美国政府所有"呢?
Yeah, but what if it's "Property of U.S. Government"?

333
00:13:40,489 --> 00:13:43,223
在德克萨斯州的Amarillo有一个国家氦元素储备地
There's a national helium reserve in Amarillo, Texas.

334
00:13:43,225 --> 00:13:44,658
如果这罐液氦是从那里偷出来的
If this was stolen from there,

335
00:13:44,660 --> 00:13:46,660
我们就触犯了联邦的法律
we're accessories to a federal crime.

336
00:13:46,662 --> 00:13:48,162
先别急着下结论
Let's not jump to conclusions.

337
00:13:48,164 --> 00:13:49,730
很多机构都是"U"开头的
A lot of things start with "U."

338
00:13:49,732 --> 00:13:50,764
说得也对
That's true.

339
00:13:50,766 --> 00:13:52,833
美国空军 美国国防部
There's the U.S. Air Force,

340
00:13:52,835 --> 00:13:55,302
美国海军 都是字母"U"开头的
U.S. Department of Defense, U.S. Navy,

341
00:13:55,304 --> 00:13:57,638
对于你我来说 说不定监狱也是
"you" and I are going to jail.

342
00:13:57,640 --> 00:14:00,140
听着 我们可以继续按计划做实验
Listen, we can do the experiment as planned

343
00:14:00,142 --> 00:14:01,909
要不我们先下手为强打败瑞典队
and beat the Swedish team to the punch,

344
00:14:01,911 --> 00:14:04,144
要不就和我们的梦想吻别
or we can kiss our dreams good-bye because we were

345
00:14:04,146 --> 00:14:06,313
因为我们胆子太小不敢违法
to afraid to break a few rules.

346
00:14:10,052 --> 00:14:11,518
女士您好
Ma'am.

347
00:14:14,790 --> 00:14:16,690
好了 大家都记住规则了吧?
Okay, does everyone remember the rules?

348
00:14:16,692 --> 00:14:19,126
如果这人裸上身 喝一小口
If he's shirtless, one sip.

349
00:14:19,128 --> 00:14:20,961
和宠物合照 喝两小口
Posing with a pet, two sips.

350
00:14:20,963 --> 00:14:23,997
裸上身和宠物合照 就大口喝
Pet and shirtless, chug like it's your job.

351
00:14:25,334 --> 00:14:27,568
下一个!
And pull!

352
00:14:31,207 --> 00:14:33,907
我有一条一样的内裤!
I have that same underwear!

353
00:14:35,144 --> 00:14:36,210
大口喝!
Chug!

354
00:14:38,080 --> 00:14:40,447
Amy 你收到一条消息
Mm, Amy, you're getting a text.

355
00:14:40,449 --> 00:14:42,115
嗯 把手机给我
Oh, um, give me that.

356
00:14:42,117 --> 00:14:43,917
"昨晚过得很开心"
"I had a great time last night"

357
00:14:43,919 --> 00:14:45,319
不 不 别... 别读了
No, no, st... stop reading that.

358
00:14:45,321 --> 00:14:46,553
- Dave是谁?  - 我...
- Who's Dave?  - I...

359
00:14:46,555 --> 00:14:47,721
你昨晚出去约会了吗?
You went on a date last night?

360
00:14:47,723 --> 00:14:48,655
你在和谁谈恋爱吗?
Are you seeing someone?

361
00:14:48,657 --> 00:14:49,656
不 不是... 你说的那样
No, it... it's not like that.

362
00:14:50,759 --> 00:14:53,493
"我想再和你约会一次"?
"And I'd love to take you out again"?

363
00:14:53,495 --> 00:14:54,528
- Amy!  - 咋回事?
- Amy!   - What?

364
00:14:54,530 --> 00:14:56,263
- 难以置信  - 天啊
- Can't believe it.  - Oh, my God.

365
00:14:56,265 --> 00:14:58,365
好吧 就是你说的那样
Okay, it's like that.

366
00:15:00,569 --> 00:15:03,003
多谢你能回来
Thank you for coming back.

367
00:15:03,005 --> 00:15:04,371
我通常都不会这样的
Yeah, well, normally I wouldn't,

368
00:15:04,373 --> 00:15:06,506
但是我女儿带同学回家过夜了
but my daughter's having a sleepover, and there's only

369
00:15:06,508 --> 00:15:09,810
家里的高音咆哮只有水果姐才能盖得住
so much screaming and Katy Perry a man can take.

370
00:15:09,812 --> 00:15:13,213
如果你能把我们的钱还回来
Anyway, if you could just give us our money back,

371
00:15:13,215 --> 00:15:15,616
你可以把你的液氦带走 我们也走了
you can have your helium and we'll be on our way.

372
00:15:15,618 --> 00:15:17,484
好的 出了什么问题了吗?
Yeah, well, is there something wrong with it?

373
00:15:17,486 --> 00:15:19,887
没有 我们改主意了
No, nothing. We just changed our mind.

374
00:15:19,889 --> 00:15:21,855
他是四眼仔 我又是百科全书
He has glasses and I'm a know-it-all;

375
00:15:21,857 --> 00:15:24,324
我们不是进监狱的料
we are not built for prison.

376
00:15:24,326 --> 00:15:25,859
好吧 我明白了
Yeah, I hear you.

377
00:15:25,861 --> 00:15:27,661
你们都是好人 所以...
Well, you're good guys, so I'll, uh...

378
00:15:27,663 --> 00:15:29,396
我会把液氦拿回去的
I'll take the helium off your hands.

379
00:15:29,398 --> 00:15:30,397
谢谢你
Thank you.

380
00:15:30,399 --> 00:15:32,666
但是你们的钱就拿不回去了
But you ain't getting your money back.

381
00:15:32,668 --> 00:15:35,936
你居然利用我们?
You're taking advantage of us?

382
00:15:35,938 --> 00:15:39,273
我们都商量好署名问题了
We clarified nomenclature together.

383
00:15:39,275 --> 00:15:41,675
听着 我和下一个人一样
Look, I enjoy semantic digressions

384
00:15:41,677 --> 00:15:45,479
都喜欢文字游戏 但生意就是生意
as much as the next guy, but, uh, this is business.

385
00:15:45,481 --> 00:15:47,381
好的好的
You know what?

386
00:15:47,383 --> 00:15:48,615
没事的 你可以把钱留着
It's fine. Keep the money.

387
00:15:48,617 --> 00:15:50,550
我们只想把这事翻篇
We just want to be done with this.

388
00:15:50,552 --> 00:15:52,586
没问题 但是我还要收
No problem, but I am gonna have to charge you

389
00:15:52,588 --> 00:15:55,422
一点液氦重装运费
a small helium restocking fee.

390
00:15:55,424 --> 00:15:56,957
我不理解
I don't understand.

391
00:15:56,959 --> 00:15:58,158
他还想要钱
He wants more money.

392
00:15:58,160 --> 00:16:00,994
好吧 最好别多于一千美金
Well, it better not be more than a thousand dollars,

393
00:16:00,996 --> 00:16:02,696
我就带了那么多
that's all I've got on me.

394
00:16:04,433 --> 00:16:08,001
正巧就是这么多
That's exactly how much it is.

395
00:16:08,003 --> 00:16:09,403
终于
Finally,

396
00:16:09,405 --> 00:16:11,438
有人比咱们还神机妙算了
something breaks our way.

397
00:16:15,110 --> 00:16:16,643
不敢相信 你居然在和人约会
I can't believe you're seeing someone

398
00:16:16,645 --> 00:16:17,778
而且我们毫不知情
and we don't even know about it.

399
00:16:17,780 --> 00:16:19,713
对啊 你为什么不告诉我们?
Yeah, why wouldn't you tell us?

400
00:16:19,715 --> 00:16:21,148
因为这事又陌生又奇怪
Because it's new and weird

401
00:16:21,150 --> 00:16:23,417
我想自己先弄明白
and I'm just trying to figure it all out.

402
00:16:23,419 --> 00:16:24,484
而且我知道
And I knew

403
00:16:24,486 --> 00:16:26,086
假如我告诉了你们
if I told you guys I had been out

404
00:16:26,088 --> 00:16:28,155
我和几个人出去约会过 你们就会激动得要死
with a few people that you'd get way too excited about it.

405
00:16:28,157 --> 00:16:29,056
几个人?
A few people?

406
00:16:29,058 --> 00:16:31,091
- 你说啥?! Amy!  - Amy!
- What?! Amy!  - Amy!

407
00:16:32,027 --> 00:16:34,594
那么 允许我们问问情况如何吗?
So, are we allowed to ask how it's going?

408
00:16:34,596 --> 00:16:35,996
还可以
It's going fine.

409
00:16:35,998 --> 00:16:38,332
基本都是相约去喝喝咖啡
It's mostly just been meeting people for coffee.

410
00:16:38,334 --> 00:16:41,301
啥... ?!
Wha...?!

411
00:16:41,303 --> 00:16:42,703
我以为大家会... 
I thought we were all...

412
00:16:42,705 --> 00:16:44,671
别在意
Never mind.

413
00:16:45,507 --> 00:16:47,007
我... 我以为你没准备好
I... I thought you weren't ready

414
00:16:47,009 --> 00:16:48,475
开始和人约会呢
to start seeing people.

415
00:16:48,477 --> 00:16:50,344
我没有什么约会的经验
Well, I don't have much experience dating,

416
00:16:50,346 --> 00:16:52,212
所以我觉得可能出去约会几次
so I decided it would be good for me

417
00:16:52,214 --> 00:16:53,847
会对我有益
to, you know, get out there a little.

418
00:16:53,849 --> 00:16:55,716
这样挺好的
Well, good for you.

419
00:16:55,718 --> 00:16:57,651
谢谢你
Thank you.

420
00:16:57,653 --> 00:16:59,553
那你和几个人约会过了呢?
And how many guys have you gone out with?

421
00:16:59,555 --> 00:17:00,721
但愿少于两个
Please be less than two.

422
00:17:00,723 --> 00:17:02,589
- 三个  - 该死
- Three.  - Damn it.

423
00:17:05,060 --> 00:17:08,495
好吧 瑞典人要打败我们了
Well, the Swedes might beat us,

424
00:17:08,497 --> 00:17:12,032
但是至少咱们不会在监狱里被拉帮结派
but at least we won't get gang-noogied in prison.

425
00:17:13,769 --> 00:17:18,071
你是不是除了"监狱宝贝蛋"没看过别的监狱电影?
Is Ernest Goes to Jail the only prison movie you've seen?

426
00:17:18,073 --> 00:17:20,874
{\an8}Scared Straight: 恐怖监狱 1978年上映电影

427
00:17:18,073 --> 00:17:20,874
"恐怖监狱"把我吓直了 Leonard
It scared me straight, Leonard.

428
00:17:22,644 --> 00:17:24,878
嘿 我一直在想
Hey, I've been thinking.

429
00:17:24,880 --> 00:17:26,580
是我太小气了
I was being petty.

430
00:17:26,582 --> 00:17:28,615
你们可以用我的液氦
You can have my helium.

431
00:17:29,084 --> 00:17:30,784
谢谢你 Barry
Thank you, Barry.

432
00:17:30,786 --> 00:17:33,754
但是你们要把我的名字加到论文里
But you have to add my name to your paper.

433
00:17:34,757 --> 00:17:36,123
太荒谬了
That's preposterous.

434
00:17:36,125 --> 00:17:37,457
我不知道 挺公平的
I don't know, seems fair.

435
00:17:37,459 --> 00:17:39,059
你们也可以不带我继续研究
You can't do it without me.

436
00:17:40,062 --> 00:17:41,094
可以让我们商量一下吗?
Can you give us a minute?

437
00:17:41,096 --> 00:17:42,229
慢慢谈
Take your time.

438
00:17:42,231 --> 00:17:45,465
为了戏剧效果 我会倒退出门外
I'll walk out backwards for dramatic effect.

439
00:17:51,974 --> 00:17:54,408
我不想被这样敲竹杠
I don't like being extorted like this.

440
00:17:54,410 --> 00:17:56,276
尤其不想被他敲
Especially by him of all people.

441
00:17:56,278 --> 00:17:59,346
我也不想 但是我们还有什么选择呢?
Me neither, but what other choice do we have?

442
00:17:59,348 --> 00:18:02,416
我保证这是最后一次了
I promise this is the last time.

443
00:18:12,298 --> 00:18:14,332
维基百科上这么说
It says right here on Wikipedia.

444
00:18:14,334 --> 00:18:16,768
"墨西哥对峙是指至少
"A Mexican standoff is a confrontation between

445
00:18:16,770 --> 00:18:18,036
三个政党两两间的对峙"
at least three parties."

446
00:18:18,038 --> 00:18:20,104
你怎么能相信维基百科

00:18:20,106 --> 00:18:23,942
他们明明说了三个政党 却说只有"两两"?
if they use "between" to refer to three parties?

448
00:18:25,010 --> 00:18:27,345
他们应该说"三个" 对吧?
They should've used "among," right?

449
00:18:29,348 --> 00:18:33,418
如果想要高大上一点 可以说"三者" 
Or "amongst",  if they were feeling whimsically archaic.

00:18:33,420 --> 00:18:35,186
好了 闲言少叙
All right, enough with the chitchat.

451
00:18:35,188 --> 00:18:38,056
我们还看不看"监狱宝贝蛋"了?
Are we gonna watch Ernest Goes to Jail or not?

452
00:18:38,058 --> 00:18:39,457
当然要看
Absolutely.

453
00:18:39,459 --> 00:18:41,593
但是别被吓到 这个电影
But don't be surprised if this movie sets you
