Narrator: <i>That afternoon</i>
<i>at the farhampton inn,</i>

2
00:00:07,307 --> 00:00:09,875
<i>Aunt lily and I</i>
<i>tried to check in.</i>

3
00:00:09,877 --> 00:00:11,042
Are you chewing gum?

4
00:00:11,044 --> 00:00:12,277
You never chew gum.

5
00:00:12,279 --> 00:00:14,212
You shouldn't chew gum
in here.

6
00:00:14,214 --> 00:00:16,882
Nobody cares if
I chew gum, ted.

7
00:00:16,884 --> 00:00:17,949
Are you chewing gum?

8
00:00:17,951 --> 00:00:19,784
Yes, she is.
She's chewing gum.

9
00:00:19,786 --> 00:00:21,119
Ooh, can I have a piece?

10
00:00:21,121 --> 00:00:22,854
Of course!
Great.

11
00:00:22,856 --> 00:00:23,889
Thank you.

12
00:00:23,891 --> 00:00:25,156
Okay, let's chew some gum

13
00:00:25,158 --> 00:00:26,825
And get you guys
all checked in.

14
00:00:26,827 --> 00:00:28,860
Ms. Aldrin, how many
keys will you need?

15
00:00:28,862 --> 00:00:29,861
Two, please.

16
00:00:29,863 --> 00:00:30,896
My husband's
getting in later.

17
00:00:30,898 --> 00:00:32,531
Excellent, and mr. Mosby?

18
00:00:32,533 --> 00:00:33,565
Uh, just one, please.

19
00:00:33,567 --> 00:00:36,668
Oh, oh, I-I see.

20
00:00:36,670 --> 00:00:38,570
Oh.

21
00:00:38,572 --> 00:00:40,572
Well, hang in there.

22
00:00:40,574 --> 00:00:42,407
You'll find somebody.

23
00:00:42,409 --> 00:00:45,243
Thank you,
front desk stranger.

24
00:00:45,245 --> 00:00:47,546
I'm sorry, we just... We just
don't get a lot of singles here.

25
00:00:47,548 --> 00:00:48,580
I mean,
look at this place.

26
00:00:48,582 --> 00:00:50,181
It's so romantic.

27
00:00:50,183 --> 00:00:53,585
Countless babies conceived
within these walls.

28
00:00:53,587 --> 00:00:56,054
And one... Grisly murder.

29
00:00:56,056 --> 00:00:57,188
Now, are you sure
that you wouldn't

30
00:00:57,190 --> 00:01:00,025
Feel more comfortable
staying at a motel?

31
00:01:00,027 --> 00:01:01,259
What? No, look.

32
00:01:01,261 --> 00:01:03,228
I'm not some miserable,
lonely person.

33
00:01:03,230 --> 00:01:04,596
Tell him, lily.

34
00:01:04,598 --> 00:01:06,197
It's a tough
weekend for him.

35
00:01:06,199 --> 00:01:07,332
Bro.

36
00:01:07,334 --> 00:01:08,934
We're here
for a wedding.
Ouch.

37
00:01:08,936 --> 00:01:11,736
And he used to
date the bride.
Ooh, mama.

38
00:01:11,738 --> 00:01:13,738
And he's the best man.
Devastating.

39
00:01:13,740 --> 00:01:15,273
Could you please
just check us in?

40
00:01:15,275 --> 00:01:16,908
Oh, your rooms aren't
gonna be ready for hours.

41
00:01:16,910 --> 00:01:18,577
But in the meantime,

42
00:01:18,579 --> 00:01:21,012
Ms. Aldrin, I definitely think

43
00:01:21,014 --> 00:01:23,081
You and your husband should
check out the lighthouse.

44
00:01:23,083 --> 00:01:25,850
It's a beautiful view
of the bay-- so romantic.

45
00:01:25,852 --> 00:01:26,851
Oh, wow.

46
00:01:26,853 --> 00:01:28,420
Here's the channel guide

47
00:01:28,422 --> 00:01:30,188
For the tv.

48
00:01:30,190 --> 00:01:32,424
Don't listen
to him, ted.

49
00:01:32,426 --> 00:01:34,793
(phone ringing)
you are not alone.

50
00:01:34,795 --> 00:01:37,696
In fact, this
whole weekend,

51
00:01:37,698 --> 00:01:40,131
It is going to be
nothing but me and...

52
00:01:40,133 --> 00:01:41,600
Marshall!

53
00:01:41,602 --> 00:01:42,767
Oh, thank god,
you're on your way.

54
00:01:42,769 --> 00:01:44,636
If I had to be here alone,
I would kill myself.

55

Search for NIT158

55
00:01:58,584 --> 00:02:00,085
Marshall missed
his flight.

56
00:02:00,087 --> 00:02:01,753
He might not get
here tonight.

57
00:02:01,755 --> 00:02:04,255
He might not
get here at all.

58
00:02:04,257 --> 00:02:05,457
We...

59
00:02:05,459 --> 00:02:08,460
Only have a few
of these left.

60
00:02:11,597 --> 00:02:12,897
Hi...

61
00:02:12,899 --> 00:02:13,898
Linus.

62
00:02:13,900 --> 00:02:15,600
Here's how this goes down.

63
00:02:15,602 --> 00:02:18,069
If I'm going to make it through
this weekend without my husband,

64
00:02:18,071 --> 00:02:20,171
I need you to hook a lady up.

65
00:02:20,173 --> 00:02:22,674
Any time you see me
without a drink in my hand,

66
00:02:22,676 --> 00:02:24,776
You put a drink in my hand.

67
00:02:24,778 --> 00:02:27,746
Are you my guy, linus?

68
00:02:28,748 --> 00:02:30,081
So you want the kennedy package?

69
00:02:30,083 --> 00:02:31,516
Bingo.

70
00:02:33,119 --> 00:02:34,986
(phone rings)
go for barney.

71
00:02:36,589 --> 00:02:37,789
Ah.

72
00:02:37,791 --> 00:02:40,358
Thank you linus.

73
00:02:40,360 --> 00:02:41,760
Barney,
before you get too upset,

74
00:02:41,762 --> 00:02:43,995
There's another flight
that leaves in five minutes.

75
00:02:43,997 --> 00:02:45,597
You're getting on it.
I'm gonna try.

76
00:02:45,599 --> 00:02:46,998
There is no try!

77
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:48,366
You're getting on that plane.

78
00:02:48,368 --> 00:02:50,201
Hey, growth spurt.

79
00:02:50,203 --> 00:02:53,104
If there is only one seat
left on this plane,

80
00:02:53,106 --> 00:02:54,939
I will fight you for it.

81
00:02:54,941 --> 00:02:57,008
And I'm a biter.

82
00:02:57,010 --> 00:02:58,610
Marshall, whoever that is,
grab her carry-on

83
00:02:58,612 --> 00:03:00,178
And throw it
into a restricted area.

84
00:03:00,180 --> 00:03:01,813
I'm serious. Do it.
Do it now.

85
00:03:01,815 --> 00:03:03,381
What? No.

86
00:03:03,383 --> 00:03:04,449
Barney, are you...?

87
00:03:04,451 --> 00:03:05,950
No, I'm not gonna...

88
00:03:05,952 --> 00:03:07,152
That's... No.

89
00:03:07,154 --> 00:03:09,287
There is no
"what, no, barney, are you,

90
00:03:09,289 --> 00:03:11,289
No I'm not gonna, that's no!"

91
00:03:11,291 --> 00:03:13,458
This is a holiday weekend.

92
00:03:13,460 --> 00:03:16,394
You're not gonna get
to new york by being nice.

93
00:03:16,396 --> 00:03:18,730
So you're gonna have
to lose the whole midwestern

94
00:03:18,732 --> 00:03:20,298
Aw-shucksy-doodles thing...

95
00:03:20,300 --> 00:03:21,399
Shucksy doodles?

96
00:03:21,401 --> 00:03:22,834
...And act like a new yorker.

97
00:03:22,836 --> 00:03:25,236
A pushy, obnoxious,
knock-the-other-guy-down-

98
00:03:25,238 --> 00:03:27,739
And-take-his-hot-dog resident
of the greatest city on earth!

99
00:03:27,741 --> 00:03:29,240
No can do, barney.

100
00:03:29,242 --> 00:03:30,475
I'm from minnesota,

101
00:03:30,477 --> 00:03:32,644
Where there's plenty of hot dogs
for everyone.

102
00:03:34,246 --> 00:03:36,815
Perhaps even too many.

103
00:03:36,817 --> 00:03:37,882
But listen,

104
00:03:37,884 --> 00:03:39,417
I'm gonna get to new york

105
00:03:39,419 --> 00:03:40,752
Without being a jerk.

106
00:03:40,754 --> 00:03:42,520
Just get to new york!

107
00:03:42,522 --> 00:03:43,521
I'll get to new york!

108
00:03:43,523 --> 00:03:45,090
Nobody's getting to new york.

109
00:03:45,092 --> 00:03:46,591
Not this weekend anyway.

110
00:03:46,593 --> 00:03:49,160
There's a big storm
rolling up the east coast.

111
00:03:49,162 --> 00:03:51,162
All the airports
are closing.

112
00:03:51,164 --> 00:03:53,865
My advice is
rent a car and drive.

113
00:03:53,867 --> 00:03:55,033
But you better hurry.

114
00:03:55,035 --> 00:03:56,868
They're gonna
run out of cars soon.

115
00:03:56,870 --> 00:03:58,236
(groans)

116
00:03:58,238 --> 00:03:59,738
Okay, listen.

117
00:03:59,740 --> 00:04:01,072
If we're both
going to new york,

118
00:04:01,074 --> 00:04:04,375
Why don't we rent a car,
split the drive?

119
00:04:04,377 --> 00:04:06,177
That seems like
a reasonable plan.

120
00:04:06,179 --> 00:04:08,513
Can I help you with
that diaper bag?

121
00:04:08,515 --> 00:04:10,749
Sure. Thank you.
Oh, it's...

122
00:04:12,918 --> 00:04:15,653
Have a nice bus ride,
pumpkin head!

123
00:04:19,592 --> 00:04:21,659
(panting)

124
00:04:25,364 --> 00:04:28,099
Hey, lady.

125
00:04:28,101 --> 00:04:29,901
Yeah, you just threw away
your ticket

126
00:04:29,903 --> 00:04:31,402
To a really great road trip.

127
00:04:31,404 --> 00:04:33,738
I'm sorry, I can't hear you.

128
00:04:33,740 --> 00:04:35,874
You're all the way back there,

129
00:04:35,876 --> 00:04:38,109
And I'm all the way
up here.

130
00:04:38,111 --> 00:04:40,411
(laughing)
oh, you can hear me.

131
00:04:40,413 --> 00:04:43,047
Get ready to be driving
the jealous-mobile

132
00:04:43,049 --> 00:04:45,150
Because our car is
gonna have games,

133
00:04:45,152 --> 00:04:48,052
Snacks, a james patterson
audio book

134
00:04:48,054 --> 00:04:51,756
My mother describes as
"cluttering her glove box."

135
00:04:51,758 --> 00:04:54,826
Your car? I'll be in pittsburgh
before you get your car.

136
00:04:54,828 --> 00:04:57,495
We'll see about that.

137
00:04:57,497 --> 00:04:59,430
And if you're going to new york,
you're not gonna want

138
00:04:59,432 --> 00:05:00,498
To go through pittsburgh.

139
00:05:00,500 --> 00:05:01,933
94 backs up around allentown,

140
00:05:01,935 --> 00:05:04,435
So you're gonna want
to stick on 80.

141
00:05:04,437 --> 00:05:05,737
Jerk face!

142
00:05:07,940 --> 00:05:10,108
Come on, universe.

143
00:05:10,110 --> 00:05:11,976
I'm a nice guy.

144
00:05:11,978 --> 00:05:13,778
Send me a miracle.

145
00:05:13,780 --> 00:05:17,115
Narrator:
<i>And then the universe sent</i>
<i>your uncle marshall...</i>

146
00:05:17,117 --> 00:05:19,884
<i>Herm.</i>

147
00:05:27,493 --> 00:05:29,527
Okay, people, let's move
it along. What do you want?

148
00:05:29,529 --> 00:05:31,529
You want a car? You got a car.
Beat it.

149
00:05:31,531 --> 00:05:32,864
What kind of car
do you want?

150
00:05:32,866 --> 00:05:34,933
Too slow, you get a minivan.

151
00:05:34,935 --> 00:05:37,268
Next. Ah, midsize sedan.

152
00:05:37,270 --> 00:05:38,703
Incoming. Next.

153
00:05:38,705 --> 00:05:40,438
Yes!
You want a gas option?

154
00:05:40,440 --> 00:05:42,006
Nobody wants a gas option.
Get out of here.

155
00:05:42,008 --> 00:05:43,041
Next.

156
00:05:43,043 --> 00:05:45,276
Hello. I need a car.

157
00:05:45,278 --> 00:05:47,712
You've got it.
That's all of them.

158
00:05:47,714 --> 00:05:49,781
We're all out of cars,
everybody.

159
00:05:49,783 --> 00:05:51,349
Wait, no!

160
00:05:51,351 --> 00:05:52,851
You let this guy beat you?

161
00:05:52,853 --> 00:05:54,619
Ma'am, it's not a race.

162
00:05:54,621 --> 00:05:57,455
That right there
is why you lost.

163
00:05:58,357 --> 00:06:00,725
Maybe this is your fault.

164
00:06:00,727 --> 00:06:01,960
Did you ever think of that?

165
00:06:01,962 --> 00:06:03,328
Maybe if you
had just been

166
00:06:03,330 --> 00:06:05,697
A little bit nicer,
then you would be

167
00:06:05,699 --> 00:06:07,398
The one driving this lovely...

168
00:06:07,400 --> 00:06:09,367
What kind of car is it?

169
00:06:09,369 --> 00:06:12,170
Narrator:
<i>Now, kids, I don't remember</i>

2006 monstrosity.

173

Oh, no, not a monstrosity.

176
00:06:27,654 --> 00:06:29,654
I'll take it.
I can't drive that.

177
00:06:29,656 --> 00:06:31,422
I can. Give me the monstrosity.

178
00:06:31,424 --> 00:06:33,858
Do you have anything else?
I'll take the monstrosity.

179
00:06:33,860 --> 00:06:35,927
There's nothing else.
Give me the keys, old man!

180
00:06:35,929 --> 00:06:37,495
It's just so freaking huge!

181
00:06:37,497 --> 00:06:39,564
Well, actually it's
a monstrosity sport,

182
00:06:39,566 --> 00:06:41,532
So it's a little smaller.

183
00:06:41,534 --> 00:06:43,501
¶ monstrosity sport

184
00:06:43,503 --> 00:06:46,237
¶ it's still freaking huge.

185
00:06:46,239 --> 00:06:47,772
Fine. I'll take it.

186
00:06:47,774 --> 00:06:49,440
But I'm also gonna need
a baby seat.

187
00:06:49,442 --> 00:06:51,743
We're all out of baby seats.
Get out of here.

188
00:06:51,745 --> 00:06:53,344
Oh, my god--
what am I gonna do?

189
00:06:53,346 --> 00:06:54,579
I don't care.

190
00:06:54,581 --> 00:06:56,581
(groans)

191
00:06:56,583 --> 00:06:57,815
Can I make a suggestion?

192
00:06:58,784 --> 00:07:00,118
I rent the car,

193
00:07:00,120 --> 00:07:02,787
Then I go buy the car seat,
come back here,

194
00:07:02,789 --> 00:07:05,757
Pick you guys up,
and then the three of us

195
00:07:05,759 --> 00:07:07,458
Drive to new york together.

196
00:07:07,460 --> 00:07:09,360
(laughs quietly)

197
00:07:09,362 --> 00:07:11,729
Let me get this straight.

198
00:07:11,731 --> 00:07:14,098
So, you're gonna
rent the car,

199
00:07:14,100 --> 00:07:17,101
Go and get a baby seat
for my son,

200
00:07:17,103 --> 00:07:20,705
And then drive all the way
back here to pick me up.

201
00:07:20,707 --> 00:07:22,040
That's right.

202
00:07:22,042 --> 00:07:24,976
Well, then you're
gonna need some cash. Here.

203
00:07:24,978 --> 00:07:27,045
Hundred bucks ought to cover it.

204
00:07:27,047 --> 00:07:28,379
So, we'll see
you soon.

205
00:07:28,381 --> 00:07:30,148
You got it, michael!
Marshall.

206
00:07:30,150 --> 00:07:32,450
Doesn't matter now, does it?

207
00:07:35,721 --> 00:07:37,822
Remember this day, marvin.

208
00:07:39,058 --> 00:07:42,126
Not only is this the day
that we either saw prince

209
00:07:42,128 --> 00:07:45,563
Or a... A really flamboyantly
dressed greyhound,

210
00:07:45,565 --> 00:07:49,267
It's also the day that your dad
chose not to be a jerk...

211
00:07:49,269 --> 00:07:51,936
And put his trust in humanity.

212
00:07:51,938 --> 00:07:54,505
Just watch where it gets us.

213
00:07:57,609 --> 00:07:59,577
Shucksy-doodles!

214
00:08:04,950 --> 00:08:06,517
Narrator: <i>Uncle marshall</i>
<i>was just about ready</i>

215
00:08:06,519 --> 00:08:07,919
<i>To abandon</i>
<i>his faith in humanity.</i>

216
00:08:07,921 --> 00:08:09,587
But let's back up a little bit.

217
00:08:09,589 --> 00:08:13,758
And now the true tale
of the stinson curse.

218
00:08:13,760 --> 00:08:17,695
Barney:
<i>Moscow, 1807.</i>

219
00:08:17,697 --> 00:08:19,697
(russian accent):
What a wonderful night
at the opera.

220
00:08:19,699 --> 00:08:21,699
Wouldn't you agree,
comrade barnovski?

221
00:08:21,701 --> 00:08:24,102
(russian accent):
I would indeed,
comrade jamesokoff.

222
00:08:24,104 --> 00:08:27,271
But you know what made it
truly wonderful?

223
00:08:27,273 --> 00:08:29,941
Being here with my wife...

224
00:08:29,943 --> 00:08:33,644
The beet in my borscht,
the fur on my hat,

225
00:08:33,646 --> 00:08:38,783
The only person I've ever
been attracted to, ever.

226
00:08:38,785 --> 00:08:40,885
I feel the same way
about kyle...

227
00:08:40,887 --> 00:08:42,954
My plutonic friend
from work.

228
00:08:42,956 --> 00:08:44,722
(clattering)

229
00:08:44,724 --> 00:08:48,459
Is it just me, or did that feel
like we hit an old gypsy woman?

230
00:08:48,461 --> 00:08:50,194
Yep. Old gypsy woman.

231
00:08:50,196 --> 00:08:52,897
Good call, barnovski.
Oh, well, she's just a peasant.

232
00:08:52,899 --> 00:08:53,998
Home, smirnoff.

233
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:56,334
Wait, she's
saying somethink!

234
00:08:56,336 --> 00:08:57,702
(low, deep moan)

235
00:08:57,704 --> 00:08:59,437
Hornier.

236
00:09:01,473 --> 00:09:03,207
Hornier.

237
00:09:04,076 --> 00:09:05,676
Hornier?

238
00:09:05,678 --> 00:09:07,545
Sonobovich!

239
00:09:07,547 --> 00:09:09,714
Did she just put a curse on us?

240
00:09:09,716 --> 00:09:11,249
Eh, nonsense, brother.

241
00:09:11,251 --> 00:09:14,152
Okay, let's go, smirnoff.

242
00:09:14,154 --> 00:09:15,219
Smirnoff?

243
00:09:16,155 --> 00:09:19,424
Homina, hominovich. Mmm,

244
00:09:19,426 --> 00:09:24,062
Smirnoff, I would climb you
like the kremlin wall.

245
00:09:24,064 --> 00:09:25,596
What's happening to me?

246
00:09:25,598 --> 00:09:28,266
Don't you see?
You're getting hornier, brother,

247
00:09:28,268 --> 00:09:30,768
Just like
the old gypsy woman said!

248
00:09:30,770 --> 00:09:32,070
Oh, hello there.

249
00:09:33,505 --> 00:09:37,141
(chuckles) ever had
a white russian?

250
00:09:40,112 --> 00:09:42,547
Barney:
<i>For the next 200 years,</i>

251
00:09:42,549 --> 00:09:45,216
<i>Every male member</i>
<i>of the stinson family</i>

252
00:09:45,218 --> 00:09:48,252
<i>Was afflicted</i>
<i>by the gypsy's curse,</i>

253
00:09:48,254 --> 00:09:49,787
<i>An unquenchable thirst</i>
<i>for booty</i>

254
00:09:49,789 --> 00:09:53,891
<i>That no committed relationship</i>
<i>could ever satisfy.</i>

255
00:09:53,893 --> 00:09:56,194
That is, until my brother james

256
00:09:56,196 --> 00:09:58,196
Met his husband tom.

257
00:09:58,198 --> 00:10:01,099
The day they got married,
they lifted the curse forever,

258
00:10:01,101 --> 00:10:03,101
Freeing me from the shackles

259
00:10:03,103 --> 00:10:05,203
Of having sex
with lots of different women.

260
00:10:05,205 --> 00:10:06,270
Although, sometimes

261
00:10:06,272 --> 00:10:08,039
Robin and I still use
the shackles.

262
00:10:08,041 --> 00:10:09,073
Bondage five!

263
00:10:09,075 --> 00:10:10,641
Whoa.
I can't, I can't,

264
00:10:10,643 --> 00:10:11,709
I can't.

265
00:10:11,711 --> 00:10:13,611
(phone rings)
go for barney!

266
00:10:14,713 --> 00:10:16,380
Ah.

267
00:10:16,382 --> 00:10:19,784
Thank you, linus.

268
00:10:19,786 --> 00:10:21,419
This is worse
than I thought.

269
00:10:21,421 --> 00:10:23,287
I know.
Showtime, no hbo?

270
00:10:23,289 --> 00:10:24,555
James:
No.

271
00:10:25,724 --> 00:10:28,226
Tom and I are getting divorced.

272
00:10:28,228 --> 00:10:29,427
What?
Ted:
What?

273
00:10:29,429 --> 00:10:31,796
That's why you look
extra handsome.

274
00:10:31,798 --> 00:10:33,631
I do get extra hot
when I'm single.

275
00:10:33,633 --> 00:10:34,732
Your skin looks amazing.

276
00:10:34,734 --> 00:10:36,067
Looks amazing.
I know.

277
00:10:36,069 --> 00:10:38,302
So... So what happened?
Why-why'd you guys break up?

278
00:10:38,304 --> 00:10:39,937
Well, the thing to remember

279
00:10:39,939 --> 00:10:41,439
Is that when something
like this happens,

280
00:10:41,441 --> 00:10:42,507
It's nobody's fault.

281
00:10:42,509 --> 00:10:44,509
You cheated on him.
Repeatedly.

282
00:10:45,677 --> 00:10:47,011
I thought about
keeping it quiet,

283
00:10:47,013 --> 00:10:50,114
But then I realized,
wouldn't my family want me

284
00:10:50,116 --> 00:10:53,618
To be honest with them
about news this big?

285
00:10:53,620 --> 00:10:57,021
Oh, can I just say five things?

286
00:10:58,857 --> 00:11:02,326
What is the matter with--
sorry, six-- you?!

287
00:11:02,328 --> 00:11:04,328
Ooh! What?!

288
00:11:04,330 --> 00:11:07,098
I'm-I'm sorry
about you and tom,

289
00:11:07,100 --> 00:11:09,467
But you can't just drop
a bombshell like this

290
00:11:09,469 --> 00:11:10,935
So close to
someone's wedding.

291
00:11:10,937 --> 00:11:13,604
You broke the curse.
You and tom

292
00:11:13,606 --> 00:11:14,772
Are the only couple

293
00:11:14,774 --> 00:11:16,374
That makes barney
believe in marriage.

294
00:11:16,376 --> 00:11:18,709
(chuckles) really?
The only couple?

295
00:11:18,711 --> 00:11:21,879
I mean, no one else
comes to mind?

296
00:11:21,881 --> 00:11:23,781
Been together 17 years?

297
00:11:23,783 --> 00:11:26,484
She's a spunky redhead,
he's got calves

298
00:11:26,486 --> 00:11:29,020
That launched a thousand
lady boners?

299
00:11:29,022 --> 00:11:30,221
Barney:
Hey, sorry about that.

300
00:11:30,223 --> 00:11:31,622
Hey, did you guys know

301
00:11:31,624 --> 00:11:35,126
That Sunday is james' and tom's
anniversary?

302
00:11:35,128 --> 00:11:37,128
How cool is that?

303
00:11:37,130 --> 00:11:38,329
We're anniversary bros!

304
00:11:38,331 --> 00:11:40,131
Every year, we should go out
and celebrate...

305
00:11:40,133 --> 00:11:41,399
Just the two of us.

306
00:11:41,401 --> 00:11:43,367
Listen, bro, you...

307
00:11:43,369 --> 00:11:45,736
I know, I know, "please, barney,

308
00:11:45,738 --> 00:11:49,006
You don't have to get us
an anniversary gift this year."

309
00:11:49,008 --> 00:11:50,208
You get them an
anniversary gift?

310
00:11:50,210 --> 00:11:51,742
Why shouldn't I?
They're the one couple

311
00:11:51,744 --> 00:11:53,411
That makes me believe marriage
is possible.

312
00:11:53,413 --> 00:11:55,313
I mean, I'm sitting right here.

313
00:11:56,481 --> 00:11:58,082
Thank you, linus.

314
00:11:58,084 --> 00:11:59,884
James:
Barney, the thing is...

315
00:11:59,886 --> 00:12:03,254
Cover your ears and hum "the
battle hymn of the republic."

316
00:12:03,256 --> 00:12:04,422
Why?

317
00:12:04,424 --> 00:12:07,024
It's for the bride.

318
00:12:07,026 --> 00:12:08,426
Oh, it's for... (humming)

319
00:12:08,428 --> 00:12:09,694
Okay, listen, james,

320
00:12:09,696 --> 00:12:11,362
My cousin vince
is a mountie.

321
00:12:11,364 --> 00:12:14,098
His girlfriend is back home,
but he gets gay at weddings.

322
00:12:14,100 --> 00:12:15,766
He's yours.
I am giving you vince.

323
00:12:15,768 --> 00:12:17,435
Just please,
don't tell barney.

324
00:12:17,437 --> 00:12:18,869
If he finds out
that the only

325
00:12:18,871 --> 00:12:20,438
Successful marriage
in his life is over...

326
00:12:20,440 --> 00:12:21,739
I hate everyone
at this table.

327
00:12:21,741 --> 00:12:22,740
...It'll spook him.

328
00:12:22,742 --> 00:12:24,008
I don't want him
getting spooked.

329
00:12:24,010 --> 00:12:26,210
Robin, have some faith.

330
00:12:26,212 --> 00:12:28,980
Do you really think what you
and barney have is that fragile?

331
00:12:30,082 --> 00:12:32,083
I don't want to find out.

332
00:12:32,085 --> 00:12:33,618
Fine.

333
00:12:36,421 --> 00:12:37,722
Thanks, baby.

334
00:12:37,724 --> 00:12:39,257
No sweat.
Mmm...

335
00:12:39,259 --> 00:12:42,026
So, james, seriously,
where's tom?

336
00:12:42,028 --> 00:12:43,261
He can't make the wedding.

337
00:12:43,263 --> 00:12:44,629
He had his wisdom teeth out.

338
00:12:44,631 --> 00:12:46,030
Ugh! On top of a divorce?

339
00:12:46,032 --> 00:12:47,164
That is rough.

340
00:12:48,367 --> 00:12:50,034
Uh-oh.

341
00:12:50,036 --> 00:12:52,970
What is she talking about?

342
00:12:54,039 --> 00:12:56,207
Tom and I are getting a divorce.

343
00:12:59,978 --> 00:13:01,345
Excuse me.

344
00:13:05,717 --> 00:13:08,619
Vince... Off the table.

345
00:13:16,395 --> 00:13:18,796
What was that?
I don't know.
It just came out.

346
00:13:18,798 --> 00:13:20,431
That's it.
It's barely even noon.

347
00:13:20,433 --> 00:13:22,099
You're cut off.

348
00:13:22,101 --> 00:13:23,668
Thank you, linus.

349
00:13:24,836 --> 00:13:26,304
Thank you, linus.

350
00:13:27,272 --> 00:13:28,906
Thank you, linus.

351
00:13:29,941 --> 00:13:31,575
Thank you, linus.

352
00:13:31,577 --> 00:13:33,110
Thank you, linus.

353
00:13:33,112 --> 00:13:35,012
Okay, but after that one,
you're cut off!

354
00:13:36,982 --> 00:13:39,450
No! No, you are not doing this.
Step away from the desk.

355
00:13:39,452 --> 00:13:40,618
What are you talking about?

356
00:13:40,620 --> 00:13:42,186
You just found out
about james and tom,

357
00:13:42,188 --> 00:13:44,588
And it totally freaked you out,
and now you're asking this guy

358
00:13:44,590 --> 00:13:45,756
To point you in the direction

359
00:13:45,758 --> 00:13:46,957
Of the nearest,
dirtiest strip club.

360
00:13:46,959 --> 00:13:49,093
Oh, well,
that-that's a tough one.

361
00:13:49,095 --> 00:13:51,762
Uh, the nearest one
that's-that's kind of dirty

362
00:13:51,764 --> 00:13:53,331
Is the sand box,

363
00:13:53,333 --> 00:13:56,267
But the, uh...
The dirtiest one that's nearby

364
00:13:56,269 --> 00:13:58,035
Is the crab shed.

365
00:13:58,037 --> 00:13:59,170
Dude.

366
00:13:59,172 --> 00:14:01,772
Sorry. Uh, but hey,
if-if you do go,

367
00:14:01,774 --> 00:14:03,808
Maybe you could take ted.

368
00:14:03,810 --> 00:14:05,343
I'm really worried
about that kid.

369
00:14:06,778 --> 00:14:09,280
No, robin, I am not
going to a strip club.

370
00:14:09,282 --> 00:14:10,614
Especially right now.

371
00:14:10,616 --> 00:14:13,617
Could you imagine
the day shift at the crab shed?

372
00:14:14,786 --> 00:14:16,654
Robin...

373
00:14:16,656 --> 00:14:19,557
I came to the desk to get this.

374
00:14:19,559 --> 00:14:21,292
Is that the key to our room?

375
00:14:21,294 --> 00:14:22,860
It's the key to james's room.

376
00:14:28,667 --> 00:14:30,000
Oh, my.

377
00:14:30,002 --> 00:14:31,369
What is that?

378
00:14:31,371 --> 00:14:32,737
It's an erotic cake.

379
00:14:32,739 --> 00:14:34,672
I wanted to surprise them
for their anniversary.

380
00:14:34,674 --> 00:14:36,140
Is that... Is that
james and tom?

381
00:14:36,142 --> 00:14:40,010
Mmm, caramel marzipan,
chocolate marzipan.

382
00:14:40,012 --> 00:14:41,545
I love chocolate
marzipan.

383
00:14:41,547 --> 00:14:44,215
So does tom.
Used to anyway.

384
00:14:45,550 --> 00:14:48,652
This is, uh, absolutely the,
uh... The weirdest thing

385
00:14:48,654 --> 00:14:51,222
Anyone has ever done
for their sibling.

386
00:14:52,758 --> 00:14:54,825
I love you so much.

387
00:14:55,761 --> 00:14:57,928
You thought I was
gonna freak out.

388
00:14:57,930 --> 00:15:00,431
Well, I mean, a gypsy
cursed your family

389
00:15:00,433 --> 00:15:03,401
To become hornier and do
awesome guitar solos.

390
00:15:03,403 --> 00:15:05,102
Can you blame me?

391
00:15:05,104 --> 00:15:07,605
Look, am I bummed about james
and tom getting a divorce?

392
00:15:07,607 --> 00:15:10,741
Obviously.
But I don't need them

393
00:15:10,743 --> 00:15:13,077
To make me believe
in true love anymore.

394
00:15:13,079 --> 00:15:14,545
I've got you for that now.

395
00:15:14,547 --> 00:15:16,380
Mmm.

396
00:15:16,382 --> 00:15:19,850
Oh, man, now I gotta figure out
what to do with all this stuff.

397
00:15:19,852 --> 00:15:22,052
Well, before we do that...

398
00:15:22,054 --> 00:15:25,089
Um, would it be all
right if I nibbled

399
00:15:25,091 --> 00:15:27,425
On your brother's
ding dong?

400
00:15:27,427 --> 00:15:30,127
How about we nibble

401
00:15:30,129 --> 00:15:33,964
On my brother's
ding dong together?

402
00:15:33,966 --> 00:15:35,766
I'd like that.

403
00:15:37,803 --> 00:15:39,937
Narrator:
So, they cleaned all that stuff
<i>out of there</i>

404
00:15:39,939 --> 00:15:41,705
<i>And had a talk with james.</i>

405
00:15:41,707 --> 00:15:45,242
<i>And barney didn't freak out,</i>
<i>because here's the thing, kids.</i>

406
00:15:45,244 --> 00:15:49,013
<i>When you believe in people,</i>
<i>people come through.</i>

407
00:15:54,419 --> 00:15:56,787
Just so we're clear,
I pick the music.

408
00:15:56,789 --> 00:15:58,055
Of course.

409
00:15:58,057 --> 00:15:59,123
Say it.

410
00:15:59,125 --> 00:16:00,758
Say, "daphne picks the music."

411
00:16:00,760 --> 00:16:02,660
Daphne picks the music.

412
00:16:02,662 --> 00:16:03,894
And you pay for gas.

413
00:16:03,896 --> 00:16:05,596
Are you kidding?
Do you have any idea

414
00:16:05,598 --> 00:16:06,897
How much gas this thing takes?

415
00:16:06,899 --> 00:16:08,065
(engine revs)
no, no, okay!

416
00:16:08,067 --> 00:16:09,400
Okay, I pay for gas.

417
00:16:09,402 --> 00:16:10,935
Good. Now, get in.

418
00:16:10,937 --> 00:16:12,770
It's a long ride to phoenix.

419
00:16:12,772 --> 00:16:14,338
Say what?

420
00:16:14,340 --> 00:16:16,674
(laughs)
I'm just kidding.

421
00:16:16,676 --> 00:16:18,676
Oh, this is gonna be fun.

422
00:16:23,615 --> 00:16:25,516
This must be the singles table.

423
00:16:25,518 --> 00:16:29,019
(chuckles)
guess it is.

424
00:16:30,622 --> 00:16:32,790
Well, it's kind of nice
to be asking this question

425
00:16:32,792 --> 00:16:34,258
Instead of answering it
for a change:

426
00:16:34,260 --> 00:16:35,326
How are you doing?

427
00:16:35,328 --> 00:16:37,094
I don't know.

428
00:16:38,163 --> 00:16:39,830
I'm trying to be happy
for my brother,

429
00:16:39,832 --> 00:16:41,599
But, uh... I guess a person

430
00:16:41,601 --> 00:16:43,467
Has a different
perspective on weddings

431
00:16:43,469 --> 00:16:46,770
When he knows what's down there
at the end of the aisle.

432
00:16:47,873 --> 00:16:49,874
It's not all
champagne and frosting.

433
00:16:50,942 --> 00:16:54,111
Mr. Stinson, your room is ready.

434
00:16:54,113 --> 00:16:55,880
And, ted...

435
00:16:55,882 --> 00:16:58,048
She's right around the corner.

436
00:16:58,050 --> 00:16:59,617
Thank you, curtis.

437
00:16:59,619 --> 00:17:01,452
I feel it, too.

438
00:17:01,454 --> 00:17:03,120
No, no, no, the-the housekeeper.

439
00:17:03,122 --> 00:17:05,189
She's in the room that's right
around the corner from yours.

440
00:17:05,191 --> 00:17:06,290
Oh.
So another hour, tops.

441
00:17:06,292 --> 00:17:08,526
Sure.

442
00:17:08,528 --> 00:17:10,194
Okay, see you later, ted.

443
00:17:10,196 --> 00:17:11,695
You're not
giving up, james.

444
00:17:12,831 --> 00:17:14,565
And neither am I.

445
00:17:29,681 --> 00:17:30,881
(footsteps approach)

446
00:17:30,883 --> 00:17:31,916
Ted:
Hey, beautiful.

447
00:17:31,918 --> 00:17:32,917
Hi.

448
00:17:32,919 --> 00:17:34,919
God, you look great.

449
00:17:34,921 --> 00:17:36,754
What? Come on.

450
00:17:36,756 --> 00:17:37,821
You do!

451
00:17:37,823 --> 00:17:39,723
I've been in a car all morning.

452
00:17:39,725 --> 00:17:42,993
I just ate a croissant crumb
that I found in my bra.

453
00:17:42,995 --> 00:17:44,361
I'm disgusting.

454
00:17:44,363 --> 00:17:47,398
Yeah, I saw you do that.
And it was super hot. Come here.

455
00:17:47,400 --> 00:17:48,933
(chuckles)
you come here.
Come here.

456
00:17:48,935 --> 00:17:51,769
No, you come here.
Come here.

457
00:17:51,771 --> 00:17:53,504
Hey, you want to hear
something funny?

458
00:17:53,506 --> 00:17:54,538
Mm-hmm.

459
00:17:54,540 --> 00:17:56,840
One year ago today,
almost to the minute,

460
00:17:56,842 --> 00:17:59,076
I was sitting
at this very table

461
00:17:59,078 --> 00:18:00,477
Right in that seat.

462
00:18:01,746 --> 00:18:04,014
Oh, yeah. I can see it.

463
00:18:04,016 --> 00:18:06,417
Nursing your gin and tonic
with three extra limes,

464
00:18:06,419 --> 00:18:08,352
Doing the crossword,

465
00:18:08,354 --> 00:18:10,888
Probably being
all showboat-y about it.

466
00:18:10,890 --> 00:18:11,889
I wasn't being
showboat-y about it.

467
00:18:11,891 --> 00:18:14,658
"vesuvius."
boo-yah!

468
00:18:16,461 --> 00:18:18,596
Oh, wait, that doesn't fit.

469
00:18:18,598 --> 00:18:20,898
The point is,
one year ago today,

470
00:18:20,900 --> 00:18:24,435
I made a promise to myself
right at this table.

471
00:18:24,437 --> 00:18:26,604
The mother:
What was the promise?

472
00:18:26,606 --> 00:18:31,108
Both teds:
I'm coming back,
and I'm bringing you.

473
00:18:31,110 --> 00:18:33,077
Wait a second.
Hold it.

474
00:18:33,079 --> 00:18:36,280
One year ago today,
you hadn't even met me.

475
00:18:36,282 --> 00:18:38,349
I know, but I knew I would.

476
00:18:39,417 --> 00:18:41,251
And now it's a year later.

477
00:18:41,253 --> 00:18:42,920
And here I am.

478
00:18:42,922 --> 00:18:44,254
Here you are.

479
00:18:44,256 --> 00:18:45,756
Love in your eyes,

480
00:18:45,758 --> 00:18:47,591
Baked goods
in your undergarments.

481
00:18:47,593 --> 00:18:48,592
Yeah.

482
00:18:48,594 --> 00:18:50,894
You picked a real winner, mosby.

483
00:18:50,896 --> 00:18:53,497
I did.

484
00:18:55,100 --> 00:18:56,934
Okay, seriously, what the crap

485
00:18:56,936 --> 00:18:58,936
Is taking so long
with these rooms?

486
00:18:58,938 --> 00:19:00,838
It was like this
last year.

487
00:19:00,840 --> 00:19:02,640
I'll be right back.

488
00:19:02,642 --> 00:19:04,875
I'll be right here.

489
00:19:23,762 --> 00:19:25,295
Sorry that took so long.

490
00:19:25,297 --> 00:19:26,630
Please...

491
00:19:26,632 --> 00:19:28,499
Try to enjoy your stay.

492
00:19:28,501 --> 00:19:30,467
I will.

493
00:19:30,469 --> 00:19:31,602
Try to.

494
00:19:31,604 --> 00:19:35,339
I will enjoy my stay.

495
00:19:35,341 --> 00:19:36,440
Try.

496
00:19:36,442 --> 00:19:38,108
Not gonna try.

497
00:19:38,110 --> 00:19:41,278
Just... Just gonna do it.

498
00:19:41,280 --> 00:19:42,279
Good for you.

499
00:19:42,281 --> 00:19:43,313
Not good for me.

500
00:19:43,315 --> 00:19:46,784
No, just-just neutral for me.

501
00:19:46,786 --> 00:19:49,219
Attaboy.
No, at not a boy.

502
00:19:51,990 --> 00:19:53,123
It gets better.

503
00:19:53,125 --> 00:19:55,626
I am fine, curtis. Okay?

504
00:19:55,628 --> 00:19:58,796
I enjoy and appreciate
the happiness of other people

505
00:19:58,798 --> 00:20:02,466
Whether I am in a relationship
or not. Okay? Curtis?

506
00:20:02,468 --> 00:20:03,634
So just-just...

507
00:20:03,636 --> 00:20:06,036
Just go ahead
and give me my one key

508
00:20:06,038 --> 00:20:07,938
Because I am fine.

509
00:20:17,682 --> 00:20:24,021
Oh, come on!
I need another drink.
