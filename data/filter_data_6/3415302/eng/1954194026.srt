00:00:04,506 --> 00:00:06,023
So?
(whispers): No.

2
00:00:06,025 --> 00:00:07,758
No. You-You were in.

3
00:00:07,760 --> 00:00:09,510
I said, "Have you met Ted"
and everything.

4
00:00:09,512 --> 00:00:11,128
How could that not work?
I don't know,

5
00:00:11,130 --> 00:00:13,130
we introduced ourselves,
I bought her a drink,

6
00:00:13,132 --> 00:00:14,348
told her I loved her...

7
00:00:14,350 --> 00:00:16,050
What?
I'm kidding.

8
00:00:16,052 --> 00:00:20,020
Hold on, Roxanne-- if that
really is your name.

9
00:00:20,022 --> 00:00:21,856
It's not. It's Robin.

10
00:00:21,858 --> 00:00:24,358
You played "Have You Met Ted"
without me?

11
00:00:24,360 --> 00:00:26,727
In <i>my</i> bar with <i>my</i> Ted?

12
00:00:26,729 --> 00:00:31,065
Maybe stealing a bro's wingman
is okay back in...

13
00:00:31,067 --> 00:00:34,434
I'm sorry, what's the name of
this third world banana republic

14
00:00:34,436 --> 00:00:35,953
you claim to be from?

15
00:00:35,955 --> 00:00:38,605
Canada.

16
00:00:38,607 --> 00:00:41,075
I have literally
never heard of that place.

17
00:00:41,077 --> 00:00:42,743
When'd you move
here, anyway?

18
00:00:42,745 --> 00:00:43,744
Two months ago.

19
00:00:43,746 --> 00:00:44,912
How do you like it?
Honestly,

20
00:00:44,914 --> 00:00:46,580
it-it's been
a little tough.

21
00:00:46,582 --> 00:00:49,467
I moved here for this on-air
reporter job at Metro News 1

22
00:00:49,469 --> 00:00:51,418
thinking it was gonna
be my big break,

23
00:00:51,420 --> 00:00:52,419
only to find out

24
00:00:52,421 --> 00:00:54,121
that our viewership
mostly consists

25
00:00:54,123 --> 00:00:55,306

26
00:00:55,308 --> 00:00:57,508

00:00:58,460 --> 00:01:01,295
To top it all off,
I have no friends.

29
00:01:02,097 --> 00:01:04,598
Um... wrong.

30
00:01:04,600 --> 00:01:05,850
You have four friends
right here.

31
00:01:05,852 --> 00:01:08,135
Right, guys?
Uh, yeah.

32
00:01:08,137 --> 00:01:09,937
You're totally in our gang,

33
00:01:09,939 --> 00:01:11,272
you're in for life, right?

34
00:01:11,274 --> 00:01:13,073
She's in.
Oh. All right.

35
00:01:13,075 --> 00:01:14,775
She's in.
Welcome.

36
00:01:14,777 --> 00:01:16,744
Well, if I'm in, I should
get the next round.

37
00:01:16,746 --> 00:01:18,195
Whoa, whoa,
Ooh,

38

46
00:01:37,049 --> 00:01:38,498
Robin's my new
best friend--

47
00:01:38,500 --> 00:01:39,967
nobody bangs her.

48
00:01:39,969 --> 00:01:40,935
Hey, hey,

49
00:01:40,937 --> 00:01:42,219
hey, she only rejected me

50
00:01:42,221 --> 00:01:44,438
three times,
she's still very much in play.

51
00:01:44,440 --> 00:01:46,390
I'm serious.

52
00:01:46,392 --> 00:01:49,860
There's only one way I'd let
either of you have sex with her.

53
00:01:49,862 --> 00:01:52,780
(gasps)
Not that. It's never that.

54
00:01:53,648 --> 00:01:54,732
I really want this girl

55
00:01:54,734 --> 00:01:56,400
to stay a part
of our lives.

56
00:01:56,402 --> 00:01:59,904
So the only way you're allowed
to hook up with her...

57
00:01:59,906 --> 00:02:02,522
is if you marry her.

58
00:02:02,524 --> 00:02:04,959

182
00:07:43,582 --> 00:07:45,198
Then would you talk to her?

183
00:07:46,751 --> 00:07:49,503
Yeah, sure. I mean,
I-I guess I would have to.

184
00:07:49,505 --> 00:07:50,504
Okay.

185
00:07:50,506 --> 00:07:52,556
Okay.

186
00:07:52,558 --> 00:07:54,040
Where is that train?

187
00:07:54,042 --> 00:07:56,677
Can I ask one more question?

188
00:07:56,679 --> 00:07:58,044
What?

189
00:07:58,046 --> 00:08:00,681
This girl with the bass guitar--

190
00:08:00,683 --> 00:08:02,382
is that her?

191
00:08:08,004 --> 00:08:09,688
That <i>is</i> her, isn't it?

192
00:08:09,690 --> 00:08:12,141
(whoops)
This is so exciting.

193
00:08:12,243 --> 00:08:13,576
G-Go talk to her.

194
00:08:13,578 --> 00:08:16,061
(whispers): All right. Just be cool,
lady. Damn.

195
00:08:16,063 --> 00:08:17,746
Why are you still
sitting here?

196
00:08:17,748 --> 00:08:21,267
Because I'm moving to
Chicago tomorrow, remember?

197
00:08:21,269 --> 00:08:23,002
And 24 hours
from now,

198
00:08:23,004 --> 00:08:26,505
my life is gonna be
completely different.

199
00:08:26,507 --> 00:08:29,425
MARSHALL: <i>This is so strange,</i>
<i>you know, now that Ted's</i>

200
00:08:29,427 --> 00:08:33,479
gone, it's just a...
a different vibe.

201
00:08:33,481 --> 00:08:36,965
You can just f-feel
his absence.

202
00:08:36,967 --> 00:08:38,684
Are you kidding me?!

203
00:08:38,686 --> 00:08:39,735
Oh, hey.

204
00:08:39,737 --> 00:08:41,987
Ted, what are
you doing here?

205
00:08:41,989 --> 00:08:43,138
Just having a drink.

206
00:08:43,140 --> 00:08:44,573
What are you doing
in New York?

207
00:08:44,575 --> 00:08:46,108
Aren't you
supposed to be in Chicago?

208
00:08:46,110 --> 00:08:47,743
No... Oh.

209
00:08:47,745 --> 00:08:49,245
Yeah, I'm not doing that.

210
00:08:49,247 --> 00:08:50,646
What?
What?

211
00:08:50,648 --> 00:08:54,166
I'm not moving to Chicago.
Why?

212
00:08:54,168 --> 00:08:55,751
I met a girl.
You...

213
00:08:55,753 --> 00:08:57,203
son of a bitch!

214
00:08:57,205 --> 00:08:58,871
What is the matter with you?

215
00:08:58,873 --> 00:09:00,322
How could you put us
through that?

216
00:09:00,324 --> 00:09:03,292
That good-bye was
emotionally devastating.

217
00:09:03,294 --> 00:09:06,178
A certain delicate flower
cried all night in the shower.

218
00:09:06,180 --> 00:09:08,047
And I was pretty
bummed, too.

219
00:09:08,049 --> 00:09:09,048
And now you're

220
00:09:09,050 --> 00:09:10,549
staying because of some girl?

221
00:09:10,551 --> 00:09:12,718
I mean, who is
this person?

222
00:09:12,720 --> 00:09:14,520
The bass player
from the wedding band.

223
00:09:14,522 --> 00:09:15,971
Oh, yeah, she's great.
(gasps)

224
00:09:15,973 --> 00:09:17,106
Love her.
Right,

225
00:09:17,108 --> 00:09:18,674
right?

226
00:09:18,676 --> 00:09:21,110
What are you... What are you doing?
Calling her.

227
00:09:21,112 --> 00:09:23,596
Don't do this.
Don't call her the next day.

228
00:09:23,598 --> 00:09:24,763
You're blowing this.
Huh?

229
00:09:24,765 --> 00:09:26,682
Three days.
You wait three days,

230
00:09:26,684 --> 00:09:27,733
Ted.
Oh, the

231
00:09:27,735 --> 00:09:30,236
three day rule
is-is a childish,

232
00:09:30,238 --> 00:09:32,538
manipulative
mind game.

233
00:09:32,540 --> 00:09:34,740
But yeah, you
wait three days.

234
00:09:34,742 --> 00:09:38,160
H-Hey, it's Ted. Hi. Um,

235
00:09:38,162 --> 00:09:40,879
listen, do you ... do you want
to have dinner tomorrow night?

236
00:09:40,881 --> 00:09:42,364
Great.

237
00:09:42,366 --> 00:09:44,216
It was clear I meant
with me, right?

238
00:09:45,135 --> 00:09:47,670
Same answer. Solid.

239
00:09:48,805 --> 00:09:51,006
MARSHALL: Why does he keep
doing this?

240
00:09:51,008 --> 00:09:53,809
He meets 'em,
he likes 'em way too much,

241
00:09:53,811 --> 00:09:56,979
he goes way too big, too soon,
and he ends up blowing it.

242
00:09:56,981 --> 00:09:58,847
I can't take this anymore.

243
00:09:58,849 --> 00:10:01,734
He's fallen in love
so many times now.

244
00:10:03,737 --> 00:10:06,054
Not like this.

245
00:10:06,056 --> 00:10:08,223
This is different.

246
00:10:08,225 --> 00:10:10,559
Come on, go talk to her.

247
00:10:10,561 --> 00:10:12,611
Oh, and it'll all be
because of me.

248
00:10:12,613 --> 00:10:15,414
And I'll sing
at your wedding. (laughs)

249
00:10:15,416 --> 00:10:17,616
Y-You are gonna have
a big wedding, right?

250
00:10:17,618 --> 00:10:20,169
What? No.
Just be cool, lady. Damn.

251
00:10:22,088 --> 00:10:24,906
(sighs) And aren't big weddings
kind of a young man's game?

252
00:10:24,908 --> 00:10:27,075
You don't have a big wedding
in your 30s.

253
00:10:27,077 --> 00:10:28,961
If I do ever get married,

254
00:10:28,963 --> 00:10:30,679
I'm keeping it simple.

255
00:10:30,681 --> 00:10:32,848
BARNEY: <i>A hot air balloon?</i>

256
00:10:32,850 --> 00:10:35,134
Well, yeah. I mean,
when you're getting married

257
00:10:35,136 --> 00:10:37,603
in a 17th-century castle in
France and making your entrance

258
00:10:37,605 --> 00:10:39,138
on a stagecoach
with six white horses,

259
00:10:39,140 --> 00:10:41,273
you kind of got to make
a big exit. (chuckles)

260
00:10:41,275 --> 00:10:44,393
How much are you
spending on this?

261
00:10:44,395 --> 00:10:46,895
Oh, like, a lot of money.

262
00:10:46,897 --> 00:10:48,280
Mm.
All of my money.

263
00:10:48,282 --> 00:10:50,816
Look, I know you guys
have been traveling a lot,

264
00:10:50,818 --> 00:10:52,234
but you're coming, right?

265
00:10:52,236 --> 00:10:54,102
Oh course. What...
Duh.

266
00:10:54,104 --> 00:10:55,621
(short laugh)
(quiet laugh)

267
00:10:55,623 --> 00:10:57,105
I'll get the next round.

268
00:10:57,107 --> 00:10:58,157
Thanks.

269
00:10:58,159 --> 00:10:59,291
I'd offer, but...

270
00:10:59,293 --> 00:11:00,409
Castle.

271
00:11:00,411 --> 00:11:03,162
Yeah.

272
00:11:03,164 --> 00:11:04,780
So, how you guys doing?

273
00:11:04,782 --> 00:11:06,632
I mean, Robin's really
taking off at work, huh?

274
00:11:06,634 --> 00:11:10,252
It's like, "Robin Scherbatsky,
World Wide News, Caracas."

275
00:11:10,254 --> 00:11:13,088
"Robin Scherbatsky, World Wide
News, St. Petersburg."

276
00:11:13,090 --> 00:11:14,723
"Robin Scherbatsky,
World Wide News,

277
00:11:14,725 --> 00:11:17,176
anywhere but New York,
apparently." (laughs)

278
00:11:17,178 --> 00:11:18,460
But it's great.

279
00:11:18,462 --> 00:11:20,729
Uh, it's makes things
super difficult for us,

280
00:11:20,731 --> 00:11:23,599
but it's great. It's great.

281
00:11:23,601 --> 00:11:26,068
It's great. It's great.

282
00:11:26,070 --> 00:11:27,152
One more and I'll believe you.

283
00:11:27,154 --> 00:11:29,321
It's great. (laughs)
Sounds great.

284
00:11:29,323 --> 00:11:30,980
Hey.
Hi, hi. Sorry I'm late.

285
00:11:30,981 --> 00:11:32,260
Can I talk to you for a minute?

286
00:11:32,285 --> 00:11:34,645
Yeah, sure. Did you wire the
down payment to the castle guy?

287
00:11:35,145 --> 00:11:36,662
I got a castle guy.

288
00:11:36,664 --> 00:11:39,081
I've got, like,
three castle guys.

289
00:11:39,083 --> 00:11:41,784
And a moat guy, so...

290
00:11:41,786 --> 00:11:44,787
I didn't wire the
payment because

291
00:11:44,789 --> 00:11:48,140
I don't think we can get
married in September.

292
00:11:48,142 --> 00:11:50,192
What-What, why?
Because,

293
00:11:50,194 --> 00:11:52,160
when I do get married,

294
00:11:52,162 --> 00:11:54,797
I kind of want to fit

295
00:11:54,799 --> 00:11:57,666
in... my dress.

296
00:11:59,052 --> 00:12:00,969
Why wouldn't you f...

297
00:12:01,671 --> 00:12:02,771
No.

298
00:12:02,773 --> 00:12:03,772
Yeah.

299
00:12:03,774 --> 00:12:04,840
No.
Yeah.

300
00:12:04,842 --> 00:12:05,841
Yeah, yeah.

301
00:12:05,843 --> 00:12:08,026
Yeah.
Whoa. (laughing)

302
00:12:09,896 --> 00:12:11,397
What's going on?

303
00:12:11,399 --> 00:12:13,866
She's getting a boob job.

304
00:12:15,184 --> 00:12:17,536
LILY: <i>We just peeked in on Penny</i>

305
00:12:17,538 --> 00:12:18,954
asleep in the baby room.

306
00:12:18,956 --> 00:12:20,072
It's adorable.

307
00:12:20,074 --> 00:12:22,458
The whole place
looks great, guys.

308
00:12:22,460 --> 00:12:25,577
But I can't believe you let Ted
hang his jousting lance

309
00:12:25,579 --> 00:12:27,963
from the renaissance fair
on your bedroom wall.

310
00:12:27,965 --> 00:12:29,882
(chuckles)
Yeah.

311
00:12:29,884 --> 00:12:31,366
That's Ted's.

312
00:12:32,385 --> 00:12:33,886
So, Marshall, how's your job going?
Mm.

313
00:12:33,888 --> 00:12:36,037
My chair...

314
00:12:36,039 --> 00:12:38,123
is reasonably comfortable.

315
00:12:38,125 --> 00:12:40,392
For short periods of time.

316
00:12:40,394 --> 00:12:42,878
Marshall has decided to say

317
00:12:42,880 --> 00:12:45,681
only positive things about
being back in corporate law.

318
00:12:45,683 --> 00:12:46,715
So you hate it?

319
00:12:46,717 --> 00:12:49,718
Much of what I do does not
make me cry.

320
00:12:49,720 --> 00:12:52,488
But the job's only temporary.

321
00:12:52,490 --> 00:12:55,407
Marshall was offered
the judgeship once,

322
00:12:55,409 --> 00:12:57,159
and he turned it down for me.

323
00:12:57,161 --> 00:12:59,778
So, karmically, that phone
has to ring again.

324
00:12:59,780 --> 00:13:01,697
And even if it doesn't,

325
00:13:01,699 --> 00:13:03,499
today, when my boss

326
00:13:03,501 --> 00:13:06,401
threw his egg salad sandwich
at my face,

327
00:13:06,403 --> 00:13:08,337
some of it got into my mouth.

328
00:13:08,339 --> 00:13:10,339
And it was tasty.

329
00:13:10,341 --> 00:13:12,541
Hey, what
about you guys?

330
00:13:12,543 --> 00:13:14,009
How was Argentina?

331
00:13:15,578 --> 00:13:17,746
Great. It was great.

332
00:13:17,748 --> 00:13:19,097
It was great.
It was great.

333
00:13:19,099 --> 00:13:20,883
It was great.
It <i>was</i> great.

334
00:13:20,885 --> 00:13:23,752
It was great.
(chuckles)

335
00:13:23,754 --> 00:13:25,637
One more and I'll
believe you.

336
00:13:25,639 --> 00:13:26,939
(sighs)
(sighs)

337
00:13:26,941 --> 00:13:28,857
This is so not great.

338
00:13:28,859 --> 00:13:31,610
I'm sorry that I have
to work while I'm here.

339
00:13:31,612 --> 00:13:32,979
It's called being on assignment.

340
00:13:33,004 --> 00:13:35,365
Well, what about me? There's
no Wi-Fi in this hotel.

341
00:13:35,366 --> 00:13:37,483
How am I supposed to
run a business, Robin,

342
00:13:37,485 --> 00:13:39,234
with no Wi-Fi?

343
00:13:39,236 --> 00:13:41,453
It's not a business,
Barney, it's a blog, okay?

344
00:13:41,455 --> 00:13:43,372
It is a lifestyle blog.

345
00:13:43,374 --> 00:13:46,492
For the upscale, sophisticated
urban gentleman, and it's

346
00:13:46,494 --> 00:13:50,295
never gonna take off if I can't
post today's boner joke.

347
00:13:53,833 --> 00:13:55,584
I know I'm always traveling.

348
00:13:55,586 --> 00:13:57,920
We both hate it when
I'm gone, we both hate it

349
00:13:57,922 --> 00:14:00,722
when I drag you with me.
Neither of us is happy.

350
00:14:02,425 --> 00:14:04,476
Is this just not
working anymore?

351
00:14:04,478 --> 00:14:07,346
Wait, w... What "this"?
This-this?

352
00:14:07,348 --> 00:14:11,683
If I gave you an out,
right now--

353
00:14:11,685 --> 00:14:13,902
if there was
an exit ramp right here

354
00:14:13,904 --> 00:14:17,406
at the three-year mark--

355
00:14:17,408 --> 00:14:19,408
would you take it?

356
00:14:20,977 --> 00:14:22,327
Before I answer that,
real quick:

357
00:14:22,329 --> 00:14:24,646
you want to get super drunk
and have sex right now?

358
00:14:24,648 --> 00:14:26,415
Of course.

359
00:14:26,417 --> 00:14:28,917
And then, one thing
led to another.

360
00:14:28,919 --> 00:14:30,485
And then another.

361
00:14:30,487 --> 00:14:31,703
And then another
after that.

362
00:14:31,705 --> 00:14:33,088
Oh.
Oh.

363
00:14:33,090 --> 00:14:35,507
And we kept drinking, and

364
00:14:35,509 --> 00:14:38,126
may have had
a little... too much.

365
00:14:42,799 --> 00:14:44,182
<i>Arigato.</i>

366
00:14:44,184 --> 00:14:45,717
Wow, these rooms
all look the same,

367
00:14:45,719 --> 00:14:47,002
even when you're sober.

368
00:14:47,004 --> 00:14:49,471
You're sober?

369
00:14:51,524 --> 00:14:53,842
So, um...

370
00:14:53,844 --> 00:14:57,446
about what we discussed
last night.

371
00:14:59,015 --> 00:15:01,366
How do you feel?

372
00:15:08,491 --> 00:15:10,626
I love you, Robin.

373
00:15:13,663 --> 00:15:16,248
And when we got married,

374
00:15:16,250 --> 00:15:22,170
I made a vow that I would always
tell you the truth.

375
00:15:23,706 --> 00:15:27,809
We got divorced.

376
00:15:33,500 --> 00:15:36,086
I can't believe you got
divorced without telling us.

377
00:15:36,087 --> 00:15:38,721
This is my mom and
dad all over again.

378
00:15:38,723 --> 00:15:40,940
Barney, if you start
brewing your own beer now

379
00:15:40,942 --> 00:15:42,709
and nail my prom
date, so help me...

380
00:15:42,711 --> 00:15:44,277
Years too late on
one of those, Teddy.

381
00:15:44,979 --> 00:15:46,546
Guys, it's okay.

382
00:15:46,548 --> 00:15:48,581
This isn't
a failed marriage.

383
00:15:48,583 --> 00:15:50,233
It's a very
successful marriage

384
00:15:50,235 --> 00:15:52,118
that happened to
only last three years.

385
00:15:52,120 --> 00:15:54,120
You both want this?

386
00:15:54,122 --> 00:15:55,955
For real?

387
00:15:55,957 --> 00:15:57,957
We do.

388
00:15:57,959 --> 00:15:59,775
For real.

389
00:16:00,544 --> 00:16:03,429
Lily, you okay?

390
00:16:03,431 --> 00:16:04,964
Of course
I'm not okay.

391
00:16:04,966 --> 00:16:07,417
This ruins
everything.

392
00:16:07,419 --> 00:16:08,751
Now we have to choose sides,

393
00:16:08,753 --> 00:16:10,887
and obviously
we're gonna choose Robin,

394
00:16:10,889 --> 00:16:12,722
but Barney has his moments.

395
00:16:12,724 --> 00:16:14,223
MARSHALL:
I really liked

396
00:16:14,225 --> 00:16:15,641
the boner joke of the day.

397
00:16:15,643 --> 00:16:17,977
Look, you guys do not need
to pick sides.

398
00:16:17,979 --> 00:16:19,187
Nothing has to change.

399
00:16:19,212 --> 00:16:20,647
No. We've already
broken up before

400
00:16:20,648 --> 00:16:22,682
and we've stayed friends,
remember?

401
00:16:22,684 --> 00:16:26,652
As long as you promise me this
won't mean we stop hanging out.

402
00:16:26,654 --> 00:16:28,855
Okay.

403
00:16:28,857 --> 00:16:30,656
I'm serious.
I know, but, I mean,

404
00:16:30,658 --> 00:16:32,608
we hardly hang out anymore
anyway.

405
00:16:32,610 --> 00:16:34,643
They live in the suburbs now,

406
00:16:34,645 --> 00:16:36,662
and you two are about
to have baby number three.

407
00:16:38,315 --> 00:16:40,450
Please. You're so obvious.

408
00:16:40,452 --> 00:16:42,985
Your gals are back up
to a full C-cup,

409
00:16:42,987 --> 00:16:45,154
and you've been sipping
her drink all night long.

410
00:16:46,040 --> 00:16:47,590
We didn't want
to announce anything

411
00:16:47,592 --> 00:16:48,958
till we knew for sure.

412
00:16:48,960 --> 00:16:50,343
Oh, my gosh, Lily!

413
00:16:50,345 --> 00:16:51,928
That's amazing!
Oh, congratulations!

414
00:16:51,930 --> 00:16:53,996
Oh, my God.
Wait, see?

415
00:16:53,998 --> 00:16:55,631
This, right here,

416
00:16:55,633 --> 00:16:58,834
this is why we can't fall
out of each other's lives.

417
00:16:58,836 --> 00:17:01,437
We have to be here
for the big moments.

418
00:17:01,439 --> 00:17:03,856
Just promise me,
no matter what,

419
00:17:03,858 --> 00:17:06,692
we will always be there
for the big moments.

420
00:17:06,694 --> 00:17:10,846
I-I promise. We'll-we'll always
be there for the big moments.

421
00:17:11,698 --> 00:17:13,699
Mm.
See?

422
00:17:13,701 --> 00:17:16,519
It's like this whole divorce
thing never happened.

423
00:17:16,521 --> 00:17:17,787
(crying)

424
00:17:17,789 --> 00:17:18,988
I...

425
00:17:21,658 --> 00:17:23,042
Hey.
Hi, sweetie.

426
00:17:23,044 --> 00:17:24,627
How was work?

427
00:17:24,629 --> 00:17:27,830
My-my boss only called me
three words

428
00:17:27,832 --> 00:17:30,500
that meant "vagina" today.

429
00:17:31,301 --> 00:17:33,035
How are the kids?
Asleep.

430
00:17:33,037 --> 00:17:35,171
Good. This is working, right?

431
00:17:35,173 --> 00:17:38,257
Marvin and Daisy sharing a room
together? It's not too cramped?

432
00:17:38,259 --> 00:17:40,259
And then when the
next one arrives,

433
00:17:40,261 --> 00:17:43,229
we'll just put her
crib... in the shower.

434
00:17:43,231 --> 00:17:45,932
It's the perfect size.
It'll save time on cleanups...

435
00:17:45,934 --> 00:17:46,882
Let's move
somewhere bigger.

436
00:17:46,884 --> 00:17:48,851
Yes. Oh, thank God.

437
00:17:48,853 --> 00:17:51,387
I mean... You know,

438
00:17:51,389 --> 00:17:53,889
don't get me wrong.
I love this apartment.

439
00:17:53,891 --> 00:17:56,159
How do you say good-bye
to so many special memories?

440
00:17:56,161 --> 00:17:59,078
Cock-a-mouse!
We have to move!

441
00:17:59,080 --> 00:18:01,280
(dance music playing)
(laughs)

442
00:18:02,466 --> 00:18:06,002
Hey, Marshall.
Robin!

443
00:18:06,004 --> 00:18:08,337
Hey, I'm so glad you're here.
It's-it's been forever.

444
00:18:08,339 --> 00:18:10,006
Oh, hey.
Hey.

445
00:18:10,008 --> 00:18:11,707
Where's your...
where's your costume?

446
00:18:11,709 --> 00:18:14,293
Oh, uh, it's been
a crazy week at work

447
00:18:14,295 --> 00:18:16,045
so no time to go shopping.

448
00:18:16,047 --> 00:18:18,347
Uh, well, who are
you supposed to be?

449
00:18:18,349 --> 00:18:20,749
Okay, I want to make it clear
this is not my idea.

450
00:18:20,751 --> 00:18:22,552
I'm Captain Ahab.

451
00:18:22,554 --> 00:18:24,804
Why is it bad
if it was your idea?

452
00:18:24,806 --> 00:18:26,889
Robin, you made it!
A white whale. Got it. (chuckles)

453
00:18:26,891 --> 00:18:29,108
Aw. Hi.
Hi.

454
00:18:29,110 --> 00:18:30,610
Yeah, I figured,

455
00:18:30,612 --> 00:18:33,929
people are thinkin' it. Might as
well steer into the skid, right?

456
00:18:33,931 --> 00:18:35,615
Where's your costume?

457
00:18:35,617 --> 00:18:36,899
Oh, you know,
I've just been so...

458
00:18:36,901 --> 00:18:38,401
(squealing)
Oh, my God, Marshall!

459
00:18:38,403 --> 00:18:40,102
Guess whose digits
I just scored?

460
00:18:40,104 --> 00:18:42,405
The slutty
police officer's...

461
00:18:42,407 --> 00:18:44,740
tax attorney.

462
00:18:44,742 --> 00:18:46,275
Hey, Robin!

463
00:18:46,277 --> 00:18:48,077
Hey.
Didn't see you there.

464
00:18:48,079 --> 00:18:50,413
(chuckling nervously)
Saved it.

465
00:18:50,415 --> 00:18:51,914
Sorry, I got to pee.

466
00:18:51,916 --> 00:18:54,717
I-I'll be back
in... an hour.

467
00:18:57,971 --> 00:18:59,589
Oh, man.

468
00:18:59,591 --> 00:19:02,175
Is Ted still wearing
his hanging chad costume?

469
00:19:02,177 --> 00:19:04,227
How old is that thing?
It's gone

470
00:19:04,229 --> 00:19:06,962
from played out to
charmingly retro and back

471
00:19:06,964 --> 00:19:08,464
six or seven times now.

472
00:19:08,466 --> 00:19:09,932
Kind of
like Ted himself.

473
00:19:09,934 --> 00:19:12,101
Tonight it's working
for him though.

474
00:19:12,103 --> 00:19:15,771
ROBIN: <i>How do you do this, Ted?</i>
<i>How do you</i>

475
00:19:15,773 --> 00:19:18,157
sit out here all night
on the roof in the cold

476
00:19:18,159 --> 00:19:21,060
and still have faith
your pumpkin's gonna show up?

477
00:19:21,062 --> 00:19:23,779
Look, I know that odds are
the love of my life

478
00:19:23,781 --> 00:19:25,831
isn't gonna magically walk
through that door

479
00:19:25,833 --> 00:19:27,650
in a pumpkin costume at...

480
00:19:27,652 --> 00:19:30,152
2:43 in the morning, but...

481
00:19:30,154 --> 00:19:33,873
this seems as nice a spot
as any to just, you know...

482
00:19:33,875 --> 00:19:36,475
sit and wait.

483
00:19:43,634 --> 00:19:45,851
Um...

484
00:19:45,853 --> 00:19:48,837
uh, c-can you tell Lily
I-I had to go?

485
00:19:48,839 --> 00:19:50,473
I got to split.

486
00:19:50,475 --> 00:19:51,774
(sighs)

487
00:19:53,977 --> 00:19:55,844
Speaking of splits, do you think
I can do a split in midair

488
00:19:55,846 --> 00:19:57,813
like my boy
David Lee Roth?

489
00:19:57,815 --> 00:19:58,681
I know you can't.

490
00:19:58,683 --> 00:20:00,349
Challenge accepted.

491
00:20:01,568 --> 00:20:03,786
(exhales)

492
00:20:05,822 --> 00:20:08,124
BARNEY:
Oh, my scrotum!

493
00:20:10,294 --> 00:20:11,860
(sighs)

494
00:20:15,799 --> 00:20:17,383
I can't get out
of this thing.

495
00:20:17,385 --> 00:20:18,801
I'm holding it.

496
00:20:18,803 --> 00:20:21,003
Wait, are you leaving?
Yeah,

497
00:20:21,005 --> 00:20:23,038
I got a big day tomorrow.
I got to get some sleep.

498
00:20:23,040 --> 00:20:26,058
No, you can't leave.
This is a big moment.

499
00:20:26,060 --> 00:20:28,477
We're saying good-bye
to the apartment.

500
00:20:28,479 --> 00:20:30,846
The whole gang has to be here.

501
00:20:30,848 --> 00:20:32,465
The gang?

502
00:20:32,467 --> 00:20:35,234
Do you know who the gang is
to me, Lily?

503
00:20:35,986 --> 00:20:36,902
Here's what the gang is:

504
00:20:36,904 --> 00:20:39,105
the gang is a married couple

505
00:20:39,107 --> 00:20:42,658
who I never see anymore,
about to have their third kid;

506
00:20:42,660 --> 00:20:44,694
it's my ex-husband,

507
00:20:44,696 --> 00:20:47,747
hitting on slutty cops
right in front of me;

508
00:20:47,749 --> 00:20:51,734
and it's the guy I probably
should have ended up with

509
00:20:51,736 --> 00:20:54,036
with the beautiful mother
of his child.

510
00:20:54,038 --> 00:20:56,289
I mean, who in their right mind
would call

511
00:20:56,291 --> 00:20:58,407
that group of people "the gang"?

512
00:20:58,409 --> 00:21:00,593
Oh...

513
00:21:02,412 --> 00:21:04,930
Oh, oh, so... so what?

514
00:21:04,932 --> 00:21:06,599
This is all

515
00:21:06,601 --> 00:21:08,351
just over then?

516
00:21:08,353 --> 00:21:11,804
Our whole friendship
is just over?

517
00:21:11,806 --> 00:21:14,857
No. No, of course not.
Look, we'll...

518
00:21:14,859 --> 00:21:17,610
we'll always be friends.
It's just...

519
00:21:17,612 --> 00:21:20,279
never gonna be how it was.

520
00:21:21,315 --> 00:21:22,598
It can't be.

521
00:21:22,600 --> 00:21:23,816
And that doesn't

522
00:21:23,818 --> 00:21:26,101
have to be a sad thing.

523
00:21:26,103 --> 00:21:28,571
There-There's so much
wonderful stuff happening

524
00:21:28,573 --> 00:21:31,106
in all of our
lives right now.

525
00:21:31,108 --> 00:21:33,409
Look, more than enough
to be grateful for.

526
00:21:34,444 --> 00:21:37,279
But the five of us
hanging out at MacLaren's,

527
00:21:37,281 --> 00:21:39,131
being young and stupid...

528
00:21:39,133 --> 00:21:42,718
(sighs) that's just not one
of those things.

529
00:21:44,004 --> 00:21:46,055
That part's over.

530
00:21:47,724 --> 00:21:50,393
(sighs)
I got to go.

531
00:21:51,478 --> 00:21:53,562
Good night, Lily.

532
00:21:54,398 --> 00:21:56,899
Good night.

533
00:22:07,994 --> 00:22:10,196
(shuddering sigh)

534
00:22:16,120 --> 00:22:17,302
LILY:
<i>Marshall's almost here.</i>

535
00:22:17,304 --> 00:22:19,221
Yes! Look at us,

536
00:22:19,223 --> 00:22:22,157
hanging out again.
This is amazing.

537
00:22:22,159 --> 00:22:23,625
This is awesome!

538
00:22:23,627 --> 00:22:27,629
This is... (roaring)
(laughing): Okay.

539
00:22:27,631 --> 00:22:29,815
Just settle down, buddy.
No!

540
00:22:29,817 --> 00:22:33,435
Settling down is for losers with
kids who never go out anymore.

541
00:22:33,437 --> 00:22:34,570
I am in
charge tonight,

542
00:22:34,572 --> 00:22:37,139
and the earliest
I am allowing anyone

543
00:22:37,141 --> 00:22:39,808
to go home is...
2:00 a.m.

544
00:22:39,810 --> 00:22:41,493
10:00 p.m.
9:45.

545
00:22:41,495 --> 00:22:42,694
3:00 a.m.

546
00:22:42,696 --> 00:22:45,697
Guys, tonight
is gonna be legen--

547
00:22:45,699 --> 00:22:48,450
wait for it...

548
00:22:48,452 --> 00:22:49,785
If I leave now,

549
00:22:49,787 --> 00:22:50,869
I could put
the kids to bed.

550
00:22:50,871 --> 00:22:51,870
I'll get the check.

551
00:22:51,872 --> 00:22:53,172
..dary!

552
00:22:53,174 --> 00:22:54,756
Legendary!

553
00:22:54,758 --> 00:22:56,875
Guys, the gang is back!

554
00:22:56,877 --> 00:23:00,328
We're back!
(sputtering, shouting)

555
00:23:00,330 --> 00:23:03,182
All of us except for Robin.

556
00:23:03,967 --> 00:23:05,500
We never see her anymore.

557
00:23:05,502 --> 00:23:07,186
Okay, in addition
to you guys not going home

558
00:23:07,188 --> 00:23:09,838
before 4:00 a.m.--
yes, it's up to 4:00 now--

559
00:23:09,840 --> 00:23:13,008
new rule: anytime anyone talks
about something sad,

560
00:23:13,010 --> 00:23:15,277
we stay out an extra hour.

561
00:23:15,279 --> 00:23:17,646
We said we'd always be there
for the big moments.

562
00:23:17,648 --> 00:23:19,398
5:00 a.m.
To be fair,

563
00:23:19,400 --> 00:23:20,849
tonight's just
us hanging out

564
00:23:20,851 --> 00:23:22,317
until 10:00 p.m., tops.

565
00:23:22,319 --> 00:23:23,318
It's not a big moment.

566
00:23:23,320 --> 00:23:24,319
BARNEY:
Um,

567
00:23:24,321 --> 00:23:25,871
yes, it is.
Um, no, it's not.

568
00:23:25,873 --> 00:23:29,124
Um, yes, it is.
Um... no, it's not.

569
00:23:29,126 --> 00:23:31,543
Um, yes, it is.

570
00:23:31,545 --> 00:23:33,912
I got a phone call today.

571
00:23:33,914 --> 00:23:37,649
A judge in Queens is retiring,
so...

572
00:23:37,651 --> 00:23:39,485
I'm gonna be a judge.

573
00:23:39,487 --> 00:23:40,302
(gasps)

574
00:23:40,304 --> 00:23:42,471
(shouting)
Yes! Yes!

575
00:23:42,473 --> 00:23:44,973
(laughing)
Judge Eriksen!

576
00:23:44,975 --> 00:23:47,559
Yeah!
(chuckling) One more.

577
00:23:47,561 --> 00:23:50,879
I told you the phone would
ring. You deserve this.

578
00:23:50,881 --> 00:23:52,397
Thanks, Lily.

579
00:23:52,399 --> 00:23:55,267
I love you, Marshmallow.
TED: Oh.

580
00:23:55,269 --> 00:23:56,852
1:45 a.m.

581
00:23:56,854 --> 00:23:59,354
Well, you were right, Barney,
this night was, in fact,

582
00:23:59,356 --> 00:24:01,401
legendary, but...

583
00:24:01,426 --> 00:24:02,692
I know what you're gonna say
and I agree.

584
00:24:02,693 --> 00:24:04,109
We're going to Vegas!

585
00:24:04,111 --> 00:24:05,527
TED:
I will be awakened

586
00:24:05,529 --> 00:24:09,698
by screaming children
in less than...

587
00:24:09,700 --> 00:24:12,284
(crying):
four-and-a-half hours.

588
00:24:12,286 --> 00:24:13,418
BARNEY:
You're staying.

589
00:24:13,420 --> 00:24:14,402
I'm going.

590
00:24:14,404 --> 00:24:15,754
Judge Fudge,
your very first ruling?

591
00:24:15,756 --> 00:24:17,172
(deep voice):
He stays.

592
00:24:17,174 --> 00:24:18,540
Hey! See?

593
00:24:18,542 --> 00:24:20,092
Tonight is about

594
00:24:20,094 --> 00:24:23,378
celebrating our enduring bond
as friends.

595
00:24:23,380 --> 00:24:26,414
Nay, family. Because
that's what we are, Ted.

596
00:24:26,416 --> 00:24:27,633
We are fa...

597
00:24:27,635 --> 00:24:29,017
Okay, fun night,
guys. Keep in touch.

598
00:24:29,019 --> 00:24:30,585
Damn it, Barney.
(choking)

599
00:24:30,587 --> 00:24:33,438
(strained):
Crushing... windpipe.

600
00:24:33,440 --> 00:24:35,691
You're lucky that's
the only pipe I'm crushing.

601
00:24:35,693 --> 00:24:38,093
Aah!
That woman is half your age.

602
00:24:38,095 --> 00:24:40,262
Haven't you changed,
even a little?

603
00:24:40,264 --> 00:24:42,364
No. I haven't.

604
00:24:43,149 --> 00:24:45,067
Look, I know
there was a time

605
00:24:45,069 --> 00:24:47,202
when it seemed like I was
capable of going the distance,

606
00:24:47,204 --> 00:24:51,206
but... if it wasn't gonna
happen with Robin,

607
00:24:51,208 --> 00:24:53,709
then it's just not gonna
happen with anyone.

608
00:24:53,711 --> 00:24:54,943
I am never

609
00:24:54,945 --> 00:24:56,828
gonna be a guy
who meets a girl

610
00:24:56,830 --> 00:24:59,131
and, from the first time
I see her, I'm just like,

611
00:24:59,133 --> 00:25:01,833
"You are the
love of my life.

612
00:25:01,835 --> 00:25:03,285
"Everything
I have

613
00:25:03,287 --> 00:25:07,089
and everything I am
is yours forever."

614
00:25:07,091 --> 00:25:08,312
Really?

615
00:25:08,337 --> 00:25:10,416
No, I'm just making a point.
Move it along.

616
00:25:11,294 --> 00:25:13,562
That's not me.

617
00:25:13,564 --> 00:25:15,630
I'm the guy
who straightens his tie,

618
00:25:15,632 --> 00:25:17,349
says something dirty,
high-fives himself

619
00:25:17,351 --> 00:25:19,651
and then goes and talks
to that girl over there.

620
00:25:20,687 --> 00:25:22,337
That's me.

621
00:25:22,339 --> 00:25:26,241
Can I please... just be me?

622
00:25:27,977 --> 00:25:30,112
Judge Fudge?

623
00:25:31,981 --> 00:25:34,333
I'll allow it.

624
00:25:34,335 --> 00:25:37,953
Then I'll a-plow it. Self-five.

625
00:25:37,955 --> 00:25:40,706
Stinson out.

626
00:25:40,708 --> 00:25:43,175
(rock music playing)

627
00:25:43,177 --> 00:25:46,044
(cheering)
Oh!

628
00:25:46,046 --> 00:25:47,846
(whoops) MARSHALL:
Hey, so are you guys

629
00:25:47,848 --> 00:25:49,514
ever gonna tie the knot
or are you...

630
00:25:49,516 --> 00:25:51,683
are you just comfortable
living in sin?

631
00:25:51,685 --> 00:25:52,884
Someone's gotten a bit...

632
00:25:52,886 --> 00:25:54,502
judge-y.
Oh!

633
00:25:54,504 --> 00:25:56,688
Sustained.
THE MOTHER: Yeah.

634
00:25:56,690 --> 00:25:58,523
We'll get around to it.
It's just, you know,

635
00:25:58,525 --> 00:26:00,859
with life and
jobs and kids.

636
00:26:00,861 --> 00:26:02,677
Plus, this one's still
insisting on getting married

637
00:26:02,679 --> 00:26:03,862
in a French castle.

638
00:26:03,864 --> 00:26:06,982
I'd get married tomorrow
in a White Castle,

639
00:26:06,984 --> 00:26:09,851
but this guy needs
more "wow factor."

640
00:26:09,853 --> 00:26:12,154
You're all the wow factor
I need.

641
00:26:12,156 --> 00:26:13,538
BARNEY:
Aw!

642
00:26:13,540 --> 00:26:15,991
(mimics retching)

643
00:26:15,993 --> 00:26:18,486
Glad someone can be happy
on the day of a tragedy.

644
00:26:18,487 --> 00:26:18,957
LILY: Aw, Barney,

645
00:26:18,962 --> 00:26:20,996
you know this is
all fake, right?

646
00:26:20,998 --> 00:26:22,748
That robot's
not really dead.

647
00:26:22,750 --> 00:26:24,082
(laughter)
I'm not

648
00:26:24,084 --> 00:26:27,135
talking about the robot, Lily.
Everyone,

649
00:26:27,137 --> 00:26:30,872
stop having fun! I'm about
to tell a sad story!

650
00:26:30,874 --> 00:26:35,043
Guys, remember back in 2010
when I achieved a perfect week?

651
00:26:35,045 --> 00:26:37,045
Seven girls in
seven nights, sure.

652
00:26:37,047 --> 00:26:38,480
BARNEY:
Well, recently,

653
00:26:38,482 --> 00:26:40,265
I decided to attempt...

654
00:26:40,267 --> 00:26:42,334
a perfect month.

655
00:26:42,336 --> 00:26:45,270
<i>I put together</i>
<i>a brand-new playbook.</i>

656
00:26:45,272 --> 00:26:48,106
No, I can't hear this.
This is just too sad.

657
00:26:48,108 --> 00:26:50,192
But I haven't gotten
to the sad part yet.

658
00:26:50,194 --> 00:26:52,560
You're in your 40s and
you have a playbook.

659
00:26:52,562 --> 00:26:53,561
That's

660
00:26:53,563 --> 00:26:54,613
the sad part.

661
00:26:54,615 --> 00:26:56,782
Lily... just...

662
00:26:56,784 --> 00:26:58,500
Okay?

663
00:26:58,502 --> 00:27:01,286
So I put together
a brand-new playbook,

664
00:27:01,288 --> 00:27:04,373
filled with plays
I'd never tried before, like...

665
00:27:05,825 --> 00:27:07,709
<i>...where,</i>
<i>as in the '80s classic,</i>

666
00:27:07,711 --> 00:27:12,097
<i>I magically</i> come <i>to life,</i>
<i>if you know what I mean.</i>

667
00:27:13,533 --> 00:27:16,184
<i>...where I wait till a girl</i>
<i>mentions something she likes.</i>

668
00:27:16,186 --> 00:27:17,919
God, I love nachos.

669
00:27:17,921 --> 00:27:19,971
Thank you.

670
00:27:19,973 --> 00:27:21,556
Allow me to introduce myself.

671
00:27:21,558 --> 00:27:22,774
My name is Jim,

672
00:27:22,776 --> 00:27:24,592
Jim Nacho.

673
00:27:24,594 --> 00:27:28,613
Inventor of the nacho.

674
00:27:28,615 --> 00:27:30,399
So... did you get
a perfect month?

675
00:27:30,401 --> 00:27:32,784
Yes.

676
00:27:32,786 --> 00:27:34,602
Then why are
you so upset?

677
00:27:34,604 --> 00:27:37,072
That last girl, number 31...

678
00:27:37,074 --> 00:27:40,075
Oh, that's a pretty name.
What is that, French?

679
00:27:40,077 --> 00:27:42,494
...she's pregnant.

680
00:27:46,741 --> 00:27:48,257
Wait, you're messing
with us, right?

681
00:27:48,282 --> 00:27:50,256
You didn't really
get a girl pregnant?

682
00:27:50,569 --> 00:27:52,176
It's real.

683
00:27:52,201 --> 00:27:53,592
She's pregnant.

684
00:27:55,019 --> 00:27:56,231
Kinda puts an asterisk,

685
00:27:56,256 --> 00:27:58,271
on the whole perfect
month thing, huh?

686
00:27:59,875 --> 00:28:01,826
Barney,
are you okay?

687
00:28:02,711 --> 00:28:05,046
Ah, Jim Nantz.

688
00:28:05,048 --> 00:28:07,916
Thank goodness. You're always
here for me in times of trouble.

689
00:28:07,918 --> 00:28:09,417
What should I do?

690
00:28:09,419 --> 00:28:11,285
You're on your own
this time, bro.

691
00:28:12,588 --> 00:28:14,789
Congratulations, Papa.

692
00:28:14,791 --> 00:28:17,558
Stop it. This is a disaster.

693
00:28:17,560 --> 00:28:18,509
Why?

694
00:28:18,511 --> 00:28:20,795
Why? Because I'm too old.

695
00:28:20,797 --> 00:28:22,063
I was about

696
00:28:22,065 --> 00:28:26,100
to enter my golden years,
my Clooney years,

697
00:28:26,102 --> 00:28:28,653
my daddy issues years,

698
00:28:28,655 --> 00:28:31,356
where I don't just remind
messed-up girls of their dads

699
00:28:31,358 --> 00:28:32,824
because I'm emotionally distant.

700
00:28:32,826 --> 00:28:36,261
I freaking look like
their dads. That's the dream.

701
00:28:36,263 --> 00:28:37,295
My life

702
00:28:37,297 --> 00:28:39,614
is over.

703
00:28:39,616 --> 00:28:42,750
So where are you guys
registered?

704
00:28:44,253 --> 00:28:47,588
TED: <i>Another fun fact about the</i>
<i>Goliath National Bank building,</i>

705
00:28:47,590 --> 00:28:50,041
the sleek but historical facade
has been described

706
00:28:50,043 --> 00:28:53,795
by <i>Architecture Vision Monthly</i>
as "modern classicism."

707
00:28:53,797 --> 00:28:55,463
I can see that.

708
00:28:55,465 --> 00:28:57,632
Mm-hmm. Any questions
from the group?

709
00:28:57,634 --> 00:28:59,000
I have a
question.

710
00:28:59,002 --> 00:29:00,935
What happened to the building
that used to be here?

711
00:29:00,937 --> 00:29:02,220
It was way nicer.

712
00:29:02,222 --> 00:29:03,471
Robin!

713
00:29:03,473 --> 00:29:05,273
Oh, my God!

714
00:29:05,275 --> 00:29:07,008
What are you doing here?

715
00:29:07,010 --> 00:29:08,009
I thought you were in...

716
00:29:08,011 --> 00:29:10,561
Greece, uh, Morocco, Moscow.

717
00:29:10,563 --> 00:29:12,730
Yeah, World Wide News
keeps me pretty busy.

718
00:29:12,732 --> 00:29:14,015
And pretty famous.

719
00:29:14,017 --> 00:29:15,316
I mean, you're everywhere.

720
00:29:15,318 --> 00:29:18,019
I am not everywhere. The...

721
00:29:18,904 --> 00:29:20,621
Okay, I'm some places.

722
00:29:20,623 --> 00:29:22,907
(laughs):
Hi, Penny.

723
00:29:22,909 --> 00:29:26,127
Oh, my gosh, I haven't
seen you in forever.

724
00:29:26,129 --> 00:29:28,696
I like you, bus lady.
Oh,

725
00:29:28,698 --> 00:29:29,714
I like you, too.

726
00:29:29,716 --> 00:29:31,198
Never call me that again.

727

728
00:29:32,002 --> 00:29:33,501
And that was it.

729
00:29:33,503 --> 00:29:35,219
Wow.
Hm.

730
00:29:35,221 --> 00:29:38,756
A genuine Scherbatsky sighting
out in nature.

731
00:29:38,758 --> 00:29:42,176
At this point, that's
like seeing Sasquatch.

732
00:29:42,178 --> 00:29:44,812
No, Sasquatch is a warm
and affectionate creature.

733
00:29:44,814 --> 00:29:46,981
At this point, Robin's
more like the yeti--

734
00:29:46,983 --> 00:29:48,516
cold and aloof.

735
00:29:49,217 --> 00:29:50,852
Hey, Ted.

736
00:29:50,854 --> 00:29:53,154
Ask me if the Abominable
Snowman called.

737
00:29:53,156 --> 00:29:54,989
Has the Abominable Snowman
called?

738
00:29:54,991 --> 00:29:56,390
Not yeti.

739
00:29:57,059 --> 00:29:58,559
Here we are again.

740
00:29:58,561 --> 00:30:02,229
Another big moment for us,
and Robin's missing it.

741
00:30:02,231 --> 00:30:03,698
MARSHALL:
I know, baby.

742
00:30:03,700 --> 00:30:06,417
I mean, the birth of her
ex-husband's love child

743
00:30:06,419 --> 00:30:09,504
is a bit of a stretch--
but I know, baby.

744
00:30:09,506 --> 00:30:11,923
(sighs)

745
00:30:11,925 --> 00:30:13,674
Well?

746
00:30:13,676 --> 00:30:15,426
It was... crazy in there,

747
00:30:15,428 --> 00:30:16,878
but...

748
00:30:16,880 --> 00:30:19,413
I threw up,
and now I feel better.

749
00:30:19,415 --> 00:30:20,548
Where were you?

750
00:30:20,550 --> 00:30:22,717
In the can.
I knew I was gonna urp,

751
00:30:22,719 --> 00:30:24,719
so I put this on over my suit.

752
00:30:24,721 --> 00:30:26,771
Number 31 won't let me
in the delivery room.

753
00:30:26,773 --> 00:30:28,589
We're gonna need a name
eventually.

754
00:30:28,591 --> 00:30:30,257

755
00:30:30,259 --> 00:30:32,193
Yes?
Congratulations.

756
00:30:32,195 --> 00:30:33,811
Congratulations because

757
00:30:33,813 --> 00:30:36,447
the blood test came back
and I'm not the father?!

758
00:30:36,449 --> 00:30:38,599
Happy Not a Father's Day!

759
00:30:38,601 --> 00:30:41,702
No. Congratulations.

It's a girl.

Nah, I'm good.

Oh, just go meet your daughter!
