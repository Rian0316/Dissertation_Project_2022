1
00:00:00,579 --> 00:00:02,312
生活大爆炸前情回顾...
Previously on The Big Bang Theory...

2
00:00:02,314 --> 00:00:03,927
我还在纠结
I guess I'm still wondering

3
00:00:03,929 --> 00:00:05,795
我和Emily相不相配
if Emily and I are right for each other.

4
00:00:05,797 --> 00:00:08,164
这和与你一起喝咖啡的妹子有关系吗?
Does this have to do with that girl you had coffee with?

5
00:00:08,166 --> 00:00:11,167
你是指我满脑子想的那位强大的性感天使?
You mean the strong, sexy angel I can't stop thinking about?

6
00:00:11,169 --> 00:00:13,503
谁知道呢?
Who can say?

7
00:00:13,505 --> 00:00:16,639
我得想出个挣钱的大招
I need to come up with a big idea to make some money.

8
00:00:16,641 --> 00:00:18,608
- 这应该不难  - 你说得容易
- There's no reason you can't.  - That's easy for you to say.

9
00:00:18,610 --> 00:00:20,043
你和Sheldon早就提出了
You and Sheldon already came up

10
00:00:20,045 --> 00:00:21,845
超流氦模型
with your superfluid helium model.

11
00:00:21,847 --> 00:00:23,046
那只是研究 
That's just research.

12
00:00:23,048 --> 00:00:24,814
我们从中挣不了钱
We're never going to make any money from it.

13
00:00:24,816 --> 00:00:26,783
管它氦不氦的... 真正的超流体 
Forget helium... the real superfluid

14
00:00:26,785 --> 00:00:29,018
是这杯子里的水果酒
is the fruit punch in this mug.

15
00:00:29,020 --> 00:00:33,122
让我想起了老爸秘制的"别告诉妈妈"果汁
It reminds me of my daddy's secret "Don't Tell Mama" juice.

16
00:00:34,860 --> 00:00:36,025
这也许是个好主意
Maybe that's an idea.

17
00:00:36,027 --> 00:00:38,761
醉酒人士的导航系统
Guidance systems for drunk people.

18
00:00:38,763 --> 00:00:40,930
已经有了 叫优步
They have that, it's called Uber.

19
00:00:42,467 --> 00:00:44,200
在你们的过冷氦气实验中
Hey, in your supercooled helium experiments,

20
00:00:44,202 --> 00:00:46,636
你们有制造出量子漩涡吗?
did you create quantum vortices?

21
00:00:46,638 --> 00:00:47,637
有啊 怎么了?
Yeah, why?

22
00:00:47,639 --> 00:00:49,072
如果你制造一个指引系统
Well, if you made a guidance system,

23
00:00:49,074 --> 00:00:51,407
可不可以用这些漩涡作为陀螺仪?
couldn't you use those vortices as a gyroscope?

24
00:00:51,409 --> 00:00:53,843
哇哦 我倒从来没这样想过
Wow. Never thought about that.

25
00:00:53,845 --> 00:00:55,612
而且既然处于量子态
And, since it's in a quantum state,

26
00:00:55,614 --> 00:00:57,113
就可以保持永久的持续性
it would maintain an infinite persistence.

27
00:00:57,115 --> 00:00:58,281
激动人心的剧情发展
Groundbreaking revelations,

28
00:00:58,283 --> 00:00:59,849
还有鸡尾酒
tropical drinks.

29
00:00:59,851 --> 00:01:03,720
这简直是欲望都市中最精彩的一集
Tell me this isn't like the best episode of Sex and the City.

30
00:01:05,462 --> 00:01:06,461
现在...

31
00:01:10,362 --> 00:01:11,661
我得问一句...
Okay, I gotta ask...

32
00:01:11,663 --> 00:01:13,429
你干啥要戴领结啊?
why are you wearing a bow tie?

33
00:01:13,431 --> 00:01:16,366
我还从来没申请过专利呢
I've never applied for a patent before.

34
00:01:16,368 --> 00:01:18,201
我想给他一个好的印象
I wanted to make a good impression.

35
00:01:18,203 --> 00:01:21,471
哦 你是想让他以为你是喜剧演员?
Oh. Is the impression that your first name is Pee-Wee?

36
00:01:26,611 --> 00:01:29,212
你还是工程师呢
Yeah, well, you're an engineer.

37
00:01:29,214 --> 00:01:30,813
笑话说完了
End of joke, burn.

38
00:01:33,652 --> 00:01:34,884
进来吧
Come on in, fellas.

39
00:01:34,886 --> 00:01:36,886
你看 他也没有戴领带啊
See, he's not wearing a tie.

40
00:01:36,888 --> 00:01:38,121
他是专利律师
Well, he's a patent attorney.

41
00:01:38,123 --> 00:01:39,989
说不定他的领带还没批下来呢
Maybe his tie is pending.

42
00:01:41,159 --> 00:01:43,326
我已经看过你们的文件了
So, I've reviewed your paperwork,

43
00:01:43,328 --> 00:01:45,628
看样子你们该有的东西都有了
and it seems like we've got everything we need

44
00:01:45,630 --> 00:01:46,696
可以为你发明的
to file a patent

45
00:01:46,698 --> 00:01:48,731
无限持续性陀螺仪申请专利了
for your infinite persistence gyroscope.

46
00:01:48,733 --> 00:01:49,832
太好了! 真棒
That's great! Excellent.

47
00:01:49,834 --> 00:01:51,200
接下来怎么办?
So what happens next?

48
00:01:51,202 --> 00:01:52,669
我们的法律团队需要检查一下
Well, the legal team needs to review

49
00:01:52,671 --> 00:01:54,604
确保你们的专利和已经存在的专利没有重复
existing patents to avoid overlap.

50
00:01:54,606 --> 00:01:56,105
我觉得应该没有
Oh, I don't think there will be.

51
00:01:56,107 --> 00:01:57,607
是啊 我们自己考证过
Yes, we did our own search.

52
00:01:57,609 --> 00:02:00,910
真好 不过我觉得我们能查得更彻底点
That's nice, but I think ours might be a bit more thorough.

53
00:02:00,912 --> 00:02:04,647
听听他说的
Get a load of this guy.

54
00:02:04,649 --> 00:02:07,016
你能想象我们用这个赚钱吗?
Can you imagine if we make money with this?

55
00:02:07,018 --> 00:02:08,584
如果我们能赚钱的话
If we do, I am splurging

56
00:02:08,586 --> 00:02:11,321
我要买全世界最贵的鼻腔冲洗器
on the best sinus irrigator money can buy.

57
00:02:12,857 --> 00:02:14,023
就像故事里说的那样...
That old sad story...

58
00:02:14,025 --> 00:02:17,060
一个人赚了点小钱 全塞自己鼻孔里了
guy gets a little money, goes straight up his nose.

59
00:02:17,062 --> 00:02:20,797
现在你们只需要看一下这份文件并签字
Just need you to review and sign this document

60
00:02:20,799 --> 00:02:22,932
表示你们同意大学校方
acknowledging that you understand the university

61
00:02:22,934 --> 00:02:25,802
拥有你们专利权的百分之七十五
will own 75% of the patent.

62
00:02:26,905 --> 00:02:29,172
百分之七十五?
75%?

63
00:02:29,174 --> 00:02:30,306
这太扯淡了
That's outrageous.

64
00:02:30,308 --> 00:02:33,109
这是我们自己研究出来的主意
This is our idea based on our research.

65
00:02:33,111 --> 00:02:36,279
学校凭什么占这么大的权重啊?
How can you possibly justify owning a majority share?

66
00:02:36,281 --> 00:02:37,747
这是学校的政策
It's university policy.

67
00:02:37,749 --> 00:02:40,016
好吧我认输
I know when I'm beat.

68
00:02:40,018 --> 00:02:42,385
等等 等等 也就是说所有的事
Hold on, hold on. So the three of us

69
00:02:42,387 --> 00:02:45,888
都是我们三个人干的 而我们只能拿百分之二十五?
do all the work and only end up with 25%?

70
00:02:45,890 --> 00:02:47,857
Hofstadter博士 大学校方
Dr. Hofstadter, this university

71
00:02:47,859 --> 00:02:49,792
十年来一直都在付你的薪水
has been paying your salaries for over ten years.

72
00:02:49,794 --> 00:02:52,495
你以为我们付你钱是因为我们好心吗?
Did you think we do that out of the goodness of our hearts?

73
00:02:52,497 --> 00:02:56,299
你要没说这种话我还真的这么想呢
Well, until you just said that mean thing, kinda.

74
00:02:57,435 --> 00:02:59,469
而且Wolowitz先生的情况也不一样
And as far as Mr. Wolowitz is concerned,

75
00:02:59,471 --> 00:03:02,705
你是公务员而且有国家航空航天局的贷款
I'm afraid as a federal employee on loan from NASA,

76
00:03:02,707 --> 00:03:04,474
专利上可以写你的名字
your name can be on the patent,

77
00:03:04,476 --> 00:03:07,877
但是你不能拿专利的股权
but you're not entitled to an ownership share.

78
00:03:07,879 --> 00:03:10,146
等等 也就是说
Wait, so this can turn out to be

79
00:03:10,148 --> 00:03:13,316
这个可能会赚大钱 但我什么都拿不到?
a financial success, and I get nothing?

80
00:03:13,318 --> 00:03:17,220
有时候他们会给你个名牌
Well, sometimes they give you a plaque.

81
00:03:17,222 --> 00:03:18,721
这不公平啊
Well, that's not fair.

82
00:03:18,723 --> 00:03:20,790
我们应该都拿得到名牌啊
We should all get plaques.

83
00:03:23,261 --> 00:03:24,927
不好意思 我们不能签字
Sorry, but we can't sign this.

84
00:03:24,929 --> 00:03:26,596
我们走吧
Come on, let's go.

85
00:03:26,598 --> 00:03:28,531
谢谢你为我们花时间
Thank you for your time.

86
00:03:31,269 --> 00:03:33,703
我再问几个关于名牌的事...
Couple of questions about the plaque...

87
00:03:34,773 --> 00:03:38,374
* 宇宙一度又烫又稠密 *
* Our whole universe was in a hot, dense state *

88
00:03:38,376 --> 00:03:41,711
* 140亿年前终于爆了炸... 等着瞧! *
* Then nearly 14 billion years ago expansion started... Wait! *

89
00:03:41,713 --> 00:03:43,346
* 地球开始降温 *
* The Earth began to cool *

90
00:03:43,348 --> 00:03:45,882
* 自养生物来起哄 穴居人发明工具 *
* The autotrophs began to drool, Neanderthals developed tools *

91
00:03:45,884 --> 00:03:48,551
* 我们建长城 我们建金字塔 *
* We built the Wall We built the pyramids *

92
00:03:48,553 --> 00:03:51,220
* 数学 自然科学 历史 揭开神秘 *
* Math, Science, History, unraveling the mystery *

93
00:03:51,222 --> 00:03:53,122
* 一切由大爆炸开始 *
* That all started with a big bang *

94
00:03:53,124 --> 00:03:55,091

00:04:04,376 --> 00:04:06,943
你有晨吐吗?
So, have you been having any morning sickness?

99
00:04:06,945 --> 00:04:08,311
有一点
A little.

100
00:04:08,313 --> 00:04:09,512
我的嗅觉变灵敏了
And it doesn't help

101
00:04:09,514 --> 00:04:10,780
也不是件好事
that I've got this heightened sense of smell.

102
00:04:10,782 --> 00:04:13,216
- 是因为怀孕吗?  - 对
- Is that a pregnancy thing?  - Yeah.

103
00:04:13,218 --> 00:04:14,350
有一天我闻出来
The other day I sniffed out

104
00:04:14,352 --> 00:04:17,086
Howie把女童子军饼干藏哪了
where Howie hid the Girl Scout cookies.

105
00:04:18,089 --> 00:04:22,492
不做跟屁虫 骗鬼呢
No more Tagalongs, my ass.

106
00:04:22,494 --> 00:04:23,893
但现在你可以自己
But now you'll be able to make

107
00:04:23,895 --> 00:04:26,930
挤奶泡饼干吃了
your own milk to eat the cookies with.

108
00:04:28,233 --> 00:04:29,999
大家好 嘿 Penny
Hey, guys. Hey, Penny.

109
00:04:30,001 --> 00:04:31,935
太感谢你能帮忙了
I really appreciate you helping me with this.

110
00:04:31,937 --> 00:04:33,269
我实在不知道该怎么办
I don't know what to do.

111
00:04:33,271 --> 00:04:35,171
- 没事 让我看看  - 看什么?
- Oh, sure. Let me see it.  - See what?

112
00:04:35,173 --> 00:04:37,240
我和Emily分手后就再没跟她说过话了
I hadn't spoken to Emily since I broke up with her,

113
00:04:37,242 --> 00:04:39,409
她把这个带张纸条放我家台阶上了
and she left this on my doorstep with a note.

114
00:04:39,411 --> 00:04:42,912
"Raj 这是我在分手前要给你的 现在退不掉了
"Raj, I got you this before we split up, but couldn't return it

115
00:04:42,914 --> 00:04:44,614
"你应该会喜欢的
"and thought you'd like to have it.

116
00:04:44,616 --> 00:04:46,783
迟到的情人节快乐 Emily"
Happy belated Valentine's Day, Emily"

117
00:04:46,785 --> 00:04:48,184
好贴心
That's nice.

118
00:04:48,186 --> 00:04:50,219
贴心 还是试图玩弄他?
Nice, or is she trying to manipulate him?

119
00:04:50,221 --> 00:04:52,789
我知道 我该打开吗? 还是退回去?
I know. I mean, do I open it? Do I return it?

120
00:04:52,791 --> 00:04:54,090
为什么不打开啊?
Why wouldn't you open it?

121
00:04:54,092 --> 00:04:55,191
她当时特别生气
Well, she was pretty mad.

122
00:04:55,193 --> 00:04:57,026
万一是个我的被插鸡鸡的
For all I know it's a voodoo doll of me

123
00:04:57,028 --> 00:04:59,629
巫毒娃娃呢
with a fork stuck in my junk.

124
00:05:01,166 --> 00:05:03,433
你不会真的认为她会给你寄一些
You don't think she'd actually send you something gross

125
00:05:03,435 --> 00:05:04,867
恶心或危险的东西吧?
or dangerous, do you?

126
00:05:04,869 --> 00:05:07,437
我有个办法找答案... 闻一下
I know one way to find out... sniff this.

127
00:05:09,274 --> 00:05:12,542
她怀孕了 又不是刑侦犬
She's pregnant, she's not a bloodhound.

128
00:05:12,544 --> 00:05:14,344
但我闻到了些许机油的气味
Although I am getting a little machine oil.

129
00:05:14,346 --> 00:05:16,012
我觉得是金属
I think it's metal.

130
00:05:16,014 --> 00:05:17,647
哎呀 打开就是了
Come on, just open it.

131
00:05:17,649 --> 00:05:20,550
你知道吗 在权力的游戏里
You know, on Game of Thrones,

132
00:05:20,552 --> 00:05:24,387
葛雷乔伊儿子的生殖器被装在盒子送给他了
Balon Greyjoy received his son's genitals in a box.

133
00:05:24,389 --> 00:05:27,090
有个备用的也不错
Well, never hurts to have a spare.

134
00:05:30,095 --> 00:05:31,327
这是什么?
What is that?

135
00:05:31,329 --> 00:05:34,130
哇 是古董六分仪
Wow. It's an antique sextant.

136
00:05:34,132 --> 00:05:37,867
水手们用它靠星星来辨别方位
Sailors used these to find their position by the stars.

137
00:05:37,869 --> 00:05:40,269
这礼物太适合天体物理学家了
What a nice gift for an astrophysicist.

138
00:05:40,271 --> 00:05:41,871
对吧 她太有心了
I know, she's so thoughtful.

139
00:05:41,873 --> 00:05:43,539
看到没 她想跟你和好呢
See, she's trying to get you back.

140
00:05:43,541 --> 00:05:45,308
我要是知道这是什么玩意或者你的职业
Now, that is exactly what I would've gotten you

141
00:05:45,310 --> 00:05:49,012
我也会送你一模一样的东西的
if I had any idea what it is or what you do.

142
00:05:49,014 --> 00:05:52,215
跟你们说 我自尊心太强了 
You know, I have too much self-esteem to let this girl

143
00:05:52,217 --> 00:05:54,517
绝不能因为内疚跟她和好
guilt me into getting back together with her.

144
00:05:54,519 --> 00:05:58,788
不用怀孕都嗅得出这屁话
You don't need to be pregnant to smell that load of crap.

145
00:06:00,959 --> 00:06:04,027
要是我们不经过学校
Well, what if we go around the university

146
00:06:04,029 --> 00:06:05,194
自己申请专利呢?
and just get the patent ourselves?

147
00:06:05,196 --> 00:06:06,529
不行 他们网站上说了
We can't. It says on their Web site,

148
00:06:06,531 --> 00:06:08,097
只要我们还在这儿工作 
as long as we work there, they have

149
00:06:08,099 --> 00:06:11,367
他们就拥有我们所有的智力财产
a controlling ownership of anything we come up with.

150
00:06:11,369 --> 00:06:13,903
得 那我在衬衫上印
Great, so they own my idea for a T-shirt

151
00:06:13,905 --> 00:06:17,140
"蠢比地质学家"的主意也归他们了
that says "Dumb as a Bag of Geologists."

152
00:06:20,445 --> 00:06:22,945
我们的选择就是要么跟学校合作
Well, our choices are we do this with the university

153
00:06:22,947 --> 00:06:24,213
要么根本不申请
or we don't do it at all.

154
00:06:24,215 --> 00:06:27,116
不管哪个 我都捞不着
Either way, I get nothing.

155
00:06:27,118 --> 00:06:29,452
或者 要是我们能从这个上面赚钱
Or, if we ended up making money from this,

156
00:06:29,454 --> 00:06:32,255
Sheldon和我可以跟你分红
Sheldon and I could split our shares with you.

157
00:06:32,257 --> 00:06:34,123
话说清楚
To be clear,

158
00:06:34,125 --> 00:06:35,625
Leonard指的是陀螺仪
Leonard is referring to the gyroscope,

159
00:06:35,627 --> 00:06:38,194
而非短袖和杯子
not the T-shirt and mugs.

160
00:06:38,196 --> 00:06:41,130
哦! 现在杯子也是他们的了
Oh! Now they own the mugs.

161
00:06:42,333 --> 00:06:44,667
这也算是一种解决办法吧
I guess that is a way around this.

162
00:06:44,669 --> 00:06:46,969
这样你们没有意见吗?
You guys would be cool doing it like that?

163
00:06:46,971 --> 00:06:48,771
当然 任何盈利都可以分成三份
Of course, we can split any profits three ways.

164
00:06:48,773 --> 00:06:49,739
我没意见
I'm fine with that.

165
00:06:49,741 --> 00:06:51,507
好 太好了
Okay, great.

166
00:06:51,509 --> 00:06:55,211
看来接下来应该签合同了
It sounds like a, uh, contract might be in order.

167
00:06:58,049 --> 00:07:00,149
嗯 我们可以拟个合同
Sure, we could write something up.

168
00:07:00,151 --> 00:07:01,851
那该选我们当中哪一个来...
But which one of us should be the party who...

169
00:07:01,853 --> 00:07:03,119
交给你了 Sheldon
You can do it, Sheldon.

170
00:07:03,121 --> 00:07:04,754
一言为定!
So stipulated!

171
00:07:06,558 --> 00:07:09,492
我曾经看到他在床底下藏的合同
Once I found a stash of contracts under his bed.

172
00:07:09,494 --> 00:07:11,027
相当怪异
It was weird.

173
00:07:14,566 --> 00:07:17,900
不知道她花了多少钱买这个
I wonder how much she spent on this.

174
00:07:17,902 --> 00:07:19,035
哦 我们查一下
Ooh, let's find out.

175
00:07:19,037 --> 00:07:20,803
钱不要紧
It doesn't matter.

176
00:07:20,805 --> 00:07:22,872
心意才重要
It's the thought that counts.

177
00:07:22,874 --> 00:07:24,373
是啊 是啊 内心美才是真的美
Yeah, yeah, and beauty's on the inside,

178
00:07:24,375 --> 00:07:26,175
尺寸不重要... 她花了多少钱?
size doesn't matter... how much she spend?

179
00:07:26,177 --> 00:07:29,545
说实话 各位 我不想知道
Seriously, guys, I don't want to know.

180
00:07:29,547 --> 00:07:31,047
我天
Oh, my.

181
00:07:31,049 --> 00:07:34,317
哦 别这样 你不能光说"我天" 然后不告诉我多少钱
Oh, come on, you can't say "Oh, my," and then not tell me!

182
00:07:34,319 --> 00:07:37,420
这些东西总共要500多美元
These things go for $500 and up.

183
00:07:37,422 --> 00:07:38,621
我去
Damn.

184
00:07:38,623 --> 00:07:40,623
我的情人节礼物就只是一张卡片
All I got for Valentine's Day was a postcard

185
00:07:40,625 --> 00:07:43,359
告诉我我订的佛蒙特泰迪熊没货了
saying my Vermont Teddy Bear was back-ordered.

186
00:07:43,361 --> 00:07:44,594
好 所以 她留了
Okay, so, she drops off

187
00:07:44,596 --> 00:07:45,962
一个500美元的礼物
a $500 gift

188
00:07:45,964 --> 00:07:47,697
你说她没有想与你复合的意思?
and she's not trying to get back together with you?

189
00:07:47,699 --> 00:07:49,365
你也许说的对
Maybe you're right.

190
00:07:49,367 --> 00:07:51,601
或者她只是说她所想 只是表示友好
Or she's telling the truth and just being nice.

191
00:07:51,603 --> 00:07:52,835
你说的也挺对
Maybe you're right.

192
00:07:52,837 --> 00:07:54,937
哇喔 我太容易被人牵着鼻子了
Wow, I am easy to manipulate.

193
00:07:58,176 --> 00:08:00,243
嘿各位 是Emily
Oh, guys, it's Emily.

194
00:08:00,245 --> 00:08:01,511
我该怎么办?
What should I do?

195
00:08:01,513 --> 00:08:02,879
好吧 接 表现强硬一点
Okay, answer it. Just be strong.

196
00:08:02,881 --> 00:08:04,714
如果她开始哭 记得不要做任何承诺
And if she starts to cry, don't make any promises.

197
00:08:04,716 --> 00:08:07,950
更重要的是 开免提我们也能听到
And most importantly, put it on speaker so we can hear.

198
00:08:10,088 --> 00:08:11,420
嘿?
Hello?

199
00:08:11,422 --> 00:08:12,889
嘿 我是Emily
Hey, it's Emily.

200
00:08:12,891 --> 00:08:14,157
现在说话方便吗?
Is this a good time?

201
00:08:16,427 --> 00:08:18,194
当然 当然 好 怎么了?
Yeah, yeah. Sure. What's up?

202
00:08:18,196 --> 00:08:20,429
你对那个礼物还满意吗?
Was it okay I left that gift?

203
00:08:20,431 --> 00:08:23,099
我真希望我们还能成朋友
I'm really hoping we can be friends.

204
00:08:26,104 --> 00:08:28,571
也许 也许吧
Maybe, maybe.

205
00:08:28,573 --> 00:08:32,441
呃 你想一起出来喝杯咖啡吗?
Um, you think you'd want to grab a cup of coffee?

206
00:08:42,754 --> 00:08:44,487
还在吗?
Hello?

207
00:08:44,489 --> 00:08:48,057
对不起 我刚刚只是花了一点时间
I'm sorry, I seem to be taking an annoying amount of time

208
00:08:48,059 --> 00:08:50,193
想想该如何决定这件事!
deciding how I feel about this!

209
00:08:51,496 --> 00:08:54,530
我只是... 我想念我们在一起的日子
I just... I miss hanging out with you.

210
00:08:54,532 --> 00:08:58,367
感觉不是我失去了一个朋友 是我失去了我最好的朋友
It's not like I lost a friend, it's like I lost my best friend.

211
00:08:58,369 --> 00:09:00,903
还可不可能
Is there any chance

212
00:09:00,905 --> 00:09:03,139
你来我这儿一次?
you'd want to come over?

213
00:09:06,144 --> 00:09:09,679
对不起 我觉得这不是一个好想法
I'm sorry, I don't think that's a good idea.

214
00:09:09,681 --> 00:09:11,747
好吧 我只是...
Okay. I'm just...

215
00:09:11,749 --> 00:09:13,216
我只是这段时间比较难熬
I'm having a really hard time,

216
00:09:13,218 --> 00:09:15,985
但是这不是你的问题 是我自己的
but that's not your problem, that's mine.

217
00:09:15,987 --> 00:09:17,887
我... 我不会再打扰你了
I... I won't bother you again,

218
00:09:17,889 --> 00:09:22,024
但是请你记住你永远在我的心里有一席之地
but please know that you'll always have a place in my heart.

219
00:09:27,065 --> 00:09:28,364
再见 Raj
Bye, Raj.

220
00:09:28,366 --> 00:09:30,700
你是个好人
You're a good guy.

221
00:09:30,702 --> 00:09:33,002
再见 Emily
Good-bye, Emily.

222
00:09:34,572 --> 00:09:36,973
这也太残酷了 各位
That was rough, you guys.

223
00:09:36,975 --> 00:09:38,841
我知道 但是你做到了 我为你骄傲
I know, but you did it. I'm so proud of you.

224
00:09:38,843 --> 00:09:41,477
哎 好吧 我就不打扰你们的女生之夜了
Well, anyway, I'll leave you to your girls' night.

225
00:09:41,479 --> 00:09:43,379
你确定你不想和我们呆在这里?
Are you sure you don't want to stay here with us?

226
00:09:43,381 --> 00:09:45,381
不了 我想自己静一静
No, I kind of feel like being alone right now.

227
00:09:45,383 --> 00:09:47,383
好吧 如果你改变了想法 我们都在这里
Well, if you change your mind, we'll be here.

228
00:09:47,385 --> 00:09:49,318
谢了
Thank you.

229
00:09:49,320 --> 00:09:51,187
代我们向Emily问好
Say hi to Emily for us.

230
00:09:51,189 --> 00:09:53,356
必须的
Will do.

231
00:10:01,449 --> 00:10:03,883
我觉得这份合约还可以
This contract looks good to me.

232
00:10:03,885 --> 00:10:05,484
我觉得非常好
I'll say it looks good.

233
00:10:05,486 --> 00:10:08,587
用了我独占的字体 Shelvetica

234
00:10:05,486 --> 00:10:08,587
 苹果电脑默认字体Helvetica

235
00:10:10,858 --> 00:10:13,225
我本来想吐槽一下的
I want to say something obnoxious,

236
00:10:13,227 --> 00:10:16,228
但是这字体的确容易看
but it is easy on the eyes.

237
00:10:16,230 --> 00:10:19,365
我有点累了 Howie 准备走吗?
I'm a little tired, Howie. You ready to go?

238
00:10:19,367 --> 00:10:21,800
好 等等 等我签了这个合同
Yeah, one sec. I just need to sign this contract.

239
00:10:21,802 --> 00:10:23,569
- 什么合同?  - 呃 我们遇到了一个问题
- What is it?  - Well, we ran into a problem

240
00:10:23,571 --> 00:10:25,271
就是我专利所有权的问题 所以我们想着
about my share of the patent, so we're forming

241
00:10:25,273 --> 00:10:28,073
组建一个合伙公司来平分所有权
a partnership to split anything we make equally.

242
00:10:28,075 --> 00:10:29,708
Sheldon 是你起草的这份合同吗?
Sheldon, did you draft the contract?

243
00:10:29,710 --> 00:10:30,876
当然是我
You bet I did.

244
00:10:30,878 --> 00:10:34,146
嗯 今晚你俩一定会使劲亲热一番
Oh. You're gonna make out so hard tonight.

245
00:10:38,119 --> 00:10:39,451
所以 你想直接就签了
So, you're just gonna sign this

246
00:10:39,453 --> 00:10:41,253
都不事先让律师看一看?
without having a lawyer look at it?

247
00:10:41,255 --> 00:10:42,788
不好意思
Excuse me.

248
00:10:42,790 --> 00:10:45,124
我从幼儿园就开始起草合同了
I've been drafting contracts since kindergarten.

249
00:10:45,126 --> 00:10:47,126
不需要律师教我用手指画画
Didn't need a lawyer to get me out of finger painting.

250
00:10:47,128 --> 00:10:49,461
现在更不需要
Don't need one now.

251
00:10:49,463 --> 00:10:51,063
- 我知道 但是...  - Bernie
- I know, but...  - Bernie,

252
00:10:51,065 --> 00:10:52,798
是他们很贴心地找了一个方法
the guys were nice enough to find a way

253
00:10:52,800 --> 00:10:54,533
来让我不被踢出局
to keep me from being cut out.

254
00:10:54,535 --> 00:10:56,435
好吧 我希望是这样
Well, I should hope so.

255
00:10:56,437 --> 00:10:58,103
整件事是你的想法
The whole thing was your idea.

256
00:10:58,105 --> 00:11:03,609
呃 公平地说 Howard的想法是建立在Sheldon的数学上的
Well, to be fair, Howard's idea was based on Sheldon's math.

257
00:11:03,611 --> 00:11:05,544
各位 每个人都参与进来了 好吗?
Guys, everyone is involved in this, okay?

258
00:11:05,546 --> 00:11:06,946
Howard的想法
Howard's invention,

259
00:11:06,948 --> 00:11:08,681
Sheldon的数学 我的初始理论
Sheldon's math, my original theory

260
00:11:08,683 --> 00:11:11,016
是我提出时空像超冷液体的理论
that space-time was like a supercooled liquid.

261
00:11:11,018 --> 00:11:12,918
我相信Penny也会提到这个
Which I'm sure Penny would've mentioned

262
00:11:12,920 --> 00:11:15,688
如果她现在没有一直玩她的手指
if she wasn't working on that hangnail right now.

263
00:11:16,791 --> 00:11:18,991
啥?
What?

264
00:11:20,194 --> 00:11:22,161
亲爱的 这很好啊
Honey, this is fine.

265
00:11:22,163 --> 00:11:24,730
如果你想签一个Sheldon编的合同
If you want to sign a contract that Sheldon whipped up,

266
00:11:24,732 --> 00:11:25,698
那就签吧
go ahead.

267
00:11:25,700 --> 00:11:27,633
我们能去走廊上说吗?
Can I talk to you in the hall?

268
00:11:27,635 --> 00:11:29,535
当然 稍等一下
Sure. Excuse us.

269
00:11:31,973 --> 00:11:33,639
- 嘿 Leonard  - 什么?
- Hey, Leonard.  - What?

270
00:11:33,641 --> 00:11:36,675
如果她觉得我们不应该申请这项专利的话
If she doesn't think that we should apply for this patent,

271
00:11:36,677 --> 00:11:39,545
那她就专的是太可笑了
she's being patently absurd.

272
00:11:41,349 --> 00:11:43,048
笑点不错
Good one.

273
00:11:43,050 --> 00:11:45,250
太好了 你明白了
Okay, you got it.

274
00:11:45,252 --> 00:11:48,420
我还担心你要想一会儿呢
See, I was afraid it was a thinker.

275
00:11:49,991 --> 00:11:52,091
- 你到底在干什么?  - 我只是想确保
What are you doing? I just want to make sure

276
00:11:52,093 --> 00:11:53,325
你认真全面地考虑了这件事
you've thought this through.

277
00:11:53,327 --> 00:11:55,160
还有什么可想的? 我们有了一项发明
What's to think about? We have an invention

278
00:11:55,162 --> 00:11:56,562
而且还想更进一步
and want to move forward.

279
00:11:56,564 --> 00:11:59,732
Howie 你现在要做的是和Sheldon Cooper
Howie, you're about to form a legal partnership

280
00:11:59,734 --> 00:12:02,735
形成法律意义上的合作关系
with Sheldon Cooper.

281
00:12:03,938 --> 00:12:06,105
好吧 如果你是想冷静地戳中要害的话
All right, if you're gonna calmly make excellent points,

282
00:12:06,107 --> 00:12:08,173
我就不确定要不要和你说话了
then I don't know if I want to talk to you.

283
00:12:11,612 --> 00:12:13,212
好了 我明白
Okay. I get it.

284
00:12:13,214 --> 00:12:15,247
你这么担心我实在很贴心
And it's sweet that you're worried about me,

285
00:12:15,249 --> 00:12:17,583
但我能照顾好自己
but I can take care of myself.

286
00:12:17,585 --> 00:12:20,185
我不是在担心你 我是在担心我自己
I'm not worried about you. I'm worried about me.

287
00:12:20,187 --> 00:12:22,688
我不想这么辛苦怀胎十月的时候还要
I don't want to go through this pregnancy listening

288
00:12:22,690 --> 00:12:25,257
比现在更多地听你抱怨Sheldon
to you complain about Sheldon driving you crazy

289
00:12:25,259 --> 00:12:26,325
又怎么把你逼疯了
more than you already do.

290
00:12:26,327 --> 00:12:30,896
现在我们又开始死循环了
Here we go with the ironclad logic again.

291
00:12:30,898 --> 00:12:33,632
你以前就已经试过和他一起工作了
You've tried to work with him before.

292
00:12:33,634 --> 00:12:34,900
结果并不理想
It hasn't gone well.

293
00:12:34,902 --> 00:12:37,403
这次又怎么会有什么不同?
Why is this time gonna be any different?

294
00:12:37,405 --> 00:12:39,505
你是不是借用了宝宝的神力?
Is the fetus helping you?

295
00:12:39,507 --> 00:12:41,373
这算作弊你造吗
'Cause that's cheating.

296
00:12:46,380 --> 00:12:48,447
- 你好?  - 嘿 Raj
- Hello?  - Hey, Raj.

297
00:12:48,449 --> 00:12:49,815
我是Claire 你好吗?
It's Claire. How are you?

298
00:12:49,817 --> 00:12:51,884
你好 我很好 真的很好
Hi. I'm good. Really good.

299
00:12:51,886 --> 00:12:53,952
额 我也不知道为什么要说 "真的狠好"
Well, I don't know why I said "really good."

300
00:12:53,954 --> 00:12:55,220
我其实只是一般好
I'm just regular good.

301
00:12:55,222 --> 00:12:56,555
我真的很想听上去自信一点
I really just wanted to sound confident.

302
00:12:56,557 --> 00:12:58,190
这里的 "真的" 是真的 “真的”
And that "really" was a real "really,"

303
00:12:58,192 --> 00:13:01,794
不像第一个 “真的” 其实是假的
not a fake "really" like the first "really."

304
00:13:01,796 --> 00:13:03,028
真的?
Really?

305
00:13:03,030 --> 00:13:06,065
我不知道 我迷失了 也错过了高速出口
I don't know. I lost track and I missed my exit.

306
00:13:06,067 --> 00:13:07,833
那么... 你咋了?
So, uh... so what's up?

307
00:13:07,835 --> 00:13:09,134
上次我们聊天的时候
Well, last time we talked,

308
00:13:09,136 --> 00:13:12,104
我刚和我男朋友和好了
I had just gotten back together with my boyfriend,

309
00:13:12,106 --> 00:13:14,907
但我希望你知道我们最终还是没法在一起
and I wanted to let you know that things didn't work out.

310
00:13:14,909 --> 00:13:16,308
真的咩? 我很抱歉
Really? I'm sorry.

311
00:13:16,310 --> 00:13:18,577
我绝对不是只会这一句
I swear I know other words.

312
00:13:18,579 --> 00:13:20,913
如果你还是想的话...
So if you were still interested...

313
00:13:20,915 --> 00:13:23,382
我有! 真的有! 绝对有! 非常有!
Yes! Indeed! Absolutely! Indubitably!

314
00:13:23,384 --> 00:13:25,217
其实我都不知道啥叫“非常有”
I'm not even sure what the last one means,

315
00:13:25,219 --> 00:13:27,319
但我好歹没有一直说“真的”了
but it's another word, and I know it.

316
00:13:27,321 --> 00:13:28,821
那么
So, uh,

317
00:13:28,823 --> 00:13:30,289
你想什么时候见一面呢?
when do you want to meet up?

318
00:13:30,291 --> 00:13:31,990
我马上就下班了
Uh, I'm almost off work.

319
00:13:31,992 --> 00:13:33,192
你现在在做什么?
What are you doing now?

320
00:13:33,194 --> 00:13:35,094
现... 现在啊 这个...
R... Right now, well...

321
00:13:35,096 --> 00:13:37,529
这个 其实 我也不想对你有所隐瞒
Well, actually, to... to be completely honest,

322
00:13:37,531 --> 00:13:39,264
我打算去看看我的前女友
I'm stopping by to see my ex-girlfriend

323
00:13:39,266 --> 00:13:41,033
因为她现在是在不太好 但是...
because she's having a tough time. But...

324
00:13:41,035 --> 00:13:42,968
这并不代表我们就要和好什么的
it's not like we're getting back together or anything.

325
00:13:42,970 --> 00:13:45,704
让我猜猜看 关于分手最惨的一部分莫过于
Let me guess, the worst part about breaking up

326
00:13:45,706 --> 00:13:48,841
她已经不再有能说话的好朋友了?
is that she doesn't have her best friend to talk to anymore?

327
00:13:48,843 --> 00:13:50,342
这和她说的一模一样
That's exactly what she said!

328
00:13:50,344 --> 00:13:51,777
你是怎么知道的?
How do you know that?

329
00:13:51,779 --> 00:13:54,813
我也是个女的 这就像恋爱守则第一章
I'm a girl. It's, like, page one out of the playbook.

330
00:13:54,815 --> 00:13:58,150
你能不能给我也发一份PDF版那个守则呢?
Any chance you could send me a PDF of that playbook?

331
00:14:00,688 --> 00:14:02,054
他们出去有一会儿了
They've been out there a while.

332
00:14:02,056 --> 00:14:03,655
我希望没出什么事
I hope everything's okay.

333
00:14:03,657 --> 00:14:06,091
我想知道他们在谈什么 如果你们几个
I wonder what they're talking about. If you guys

334
00:14:06,093 --> 00:14:08,560
能闭嘴的话 我就知道了
would shut up, I could tell you.

335
00:14:08,562 --> 00:14:09,595
噢
Oh.

336
00:14:09,597 --> 00:14:11,430
淡定 淡定 淡定
Be cool, be cool, be cool.

337
00:14:12,233 --> 00:14:13,732
嘿
Hey.

338
00:14:13,734 --> 00:14:15,501
嗨 你俩没事吧?
Hello. Hey. You guys all right?

339
00:14:15,503 --> 00:14:18,971
没事 我们一直在谈
Yeah. But, um, we were talking,

340
00:14:18,973 --> 00:14:21,840
其实... 我有点担心
and... I'm a little concerned

341
00:14:21,842 --> 00:14:24,409
我们三个之间的合作伙伴关系
about the three of us forming a partnership.

342
00:14:25,513 --> 00:14:29,748
你是在说我们的有限责任公司吗?
Are you suggesting a limited liability corporation?

343
00:14:29,750 --> 00:14:33,485
因为公子我真司没想到喔
'Cause I did not L-L-see that coming.

344
00:14:35,256 --> 00:14:38,257
Sheldon 我不是担心钱的事
Sheldon, my concern is not with the money or anything.

345
00:14:38,259 --> 00:14:41,126
而是你对我的态度
It's... it's with how you treat me.

346
00:14:41,128 --> 00:14:44,029
我相信我对你还是很大度的
Well, I believe I'm treating you generously.

347
00:14:44,031 --> 00:14:46,198
这也是为什么我在起草合同的时候
That's why I've stipulated in the contract

348
00:14:46,200 --> 00:14:48,100
提及你对这项发明的贡献
that your contributions to our invention

349
00:14:48,102 --> 00:14:50,102
和我自己的一样有价值
are as valuable as my own.

350
00:14:50,104 --> 00:14:51,770
你的意思是他的贡献
Are you saying that his contributions

351
00:14:51,772 --> 00:14:53,739
实际上没有你的有价值吗?
aren't as valuable as yours?

352
00:14:53,741 --> 00:14:55,807
不 我没有那么说
No, I am not saying that,

353
00:14:55,809 --> 00:14:58,010
因为我今早一直在不停地那么说
because I kept saying that this morning

354
00:14:58,012 --> 00:15:00,345
然后Leonard说 "不要一直说了"
and Leonard said, "Stop saying that""

355
00:15:02,383 --> 00:15:04,683
看到了吗? 这就是我们每一次合作都会发生的事
See? This is what happens every time we work together.

356
00:15:04,685 --> 00:15:05,918
等等
You know what, hang on.

357
00:15:05,920 --> 00:15:07,586
如果Sheldon别无选择
What if Sheldon had no choice

358
00:15:07,588 --> 00:15:09,087
只能恭恭敬敬呢?
but to be respectful?

359
00:15:09,089 --> 00:15:13,292
这又是什么我们不知道的隐藏开关吗?
Is there a switch on the back of his neck we don't know about?

360
00:15:13,294 --> 00:15:15,360
不
No.

361
00:15:15,362 --> 00:15:17,162
我指的是你们可以在合同里加上一条 
What I'm saying is you could add a clause to the contract

362
00:15:17,164 --> 00:15:18,797
禁止他调笑Howard的规定
that he can't make fun of Howard.

363
00:15:18,799 --> 00:15:20,532
那要如何执行呢?
How would you enforce it?

364
00:15:20,534 --> 00:15:22,367
拜托 我签署的任何合同
Oh, please. Any contract I sign

365
00:15:22,369 --> 00:15:25,070
都是靠我自己的道德准则执行的
is enforced by my own personal code of ethics.

366
00:15:25,072 --> 00:15:26,905
还有他的强迫症
And his obsessive-compulsive disorder.

367
00:15:26,907 --> 00:15:28,273
对 那个也是
Yeah, that, too.

368
00:15:29,143 --> 00:15:30,242
过去一点
And scoot over.

369
00:15:30,244 --> 00:15:32,778
你的影子跑到我的专座上了
Part of your shadow's on my spot.

370
00:15:35,983 --> 00:15:37,583
Howard 你觉得如何?
Howard, what do you think?

371
00:15:37,585 --> 00:15:39,751
我同意
I'm on board.

372
00:15:39,753 --> 00:15:41,286
我立刻就加上
I'll add it right now.

373
00:15:41,288 --> 00:15:43,789
哦耶 现在是附件时间!
Oh, baby, it's addendum time!

374
00:15:49,430 --> 00:15:50,929
喂?
Hello?

375
00:15:50,931 --> 00:15:52,397
嘿 Emily 听着
Hey, Emily, listen,

376
00:15:52,399 --> 00:15:54,566
我想了一下 我觉得
I've been thinking, and I'm not sure

377
00:15:54,568 --> 00:15:56,468
我过去不太合适
it's a good idea that I come over.

378
00:15:56,470 --> 00:15:57,869
哦
Oh.

379
00:15:57,871 --> 00:16:00,672
好 我理解
Okay. I understand.

380
00:16:00,674 --> 00:16:02,774
别啊 你别哭啊
No, no. Please don't cry.

381
00:16:02,776 --> 00:16:05,344
好 那我不哭!
Okay, I'll stop!

382
00:16:05,346 --> 00:16:06,912
喂?
Hello?

383
00:16:06,914 --> 00:16:11,383
嘿 Claire 计划有变...
Hey, so, listen, Claire, change of plans...

384
00:16:11,385 --> 00:16:14,353
好 你爱咋办咋办吧 但是她在耍你呢
Fine. Do what you want, but she's playing you.

385
00:16:14,355 --> 00:16:17,055
我不这么认为 听起来她很难过
I don't think so. She sounded pretty upset.

386
00:16:17,057 --> 00:16:18,290
你指的是...
You mean like...

387
00:16:18,292 --> 00:16:20,425
"我真的很想见你
"I was just really looking forward to seeing you.

388
00:16:20,427 --> 00:16:22,894
我一整天都过得很糟"这种吗
I'm having such a rough day."

389
00:16:22,896 --> 00:16:26,798
Emily 你听着...
Emily, listen...

390
00:16:26,800 --> 00:16:29,368
很抱歉
I'm sorry,

391
00:16:29,370 --> 00:16:31,236
但我不能去
but I can't come by.

392
00:16:31,238 --> 00:16:32,437
为什么不能?
Why not?

393
00:16:32,439 --> 00:16:34,673
我想我们都很清楚如果我过去的话
I think we both know if I come over,

394
00:16:34,675 --> 00:16:37,109
- 我们又会复合...  - 我跟你说了  
- we're gonna get back together and...  - I told you

395
00:16:37,111 --> 00:16:38,243
我需要一个朋友
I needed a friend.

396
00:16:38,245 --> 00:16:41,013
不然你以为呢?
What do you think is happening here?

397
00:16:41,815 --> 00:16:45,017
我待会儿打给你
Call you right back.

398
00:16:47,688 --> 00:16:51,857
我做的修改从第四页开始
The-the revisions I made start on page four.

399
00:16:51,859 --> 00:16:55,227
哇 有好多"于是"啊
Wow. That is a lot of "whereupons".

400
00:16:55,229 --> 00:16:58,630
那你该看看他给我的情人节卡片
You should see the Valentine's Day card he gave me.

401
00:16:58,632 --> 00:17:01,633
"第三条 基于此项目
"Article three: As it pertains to this project,

402
00:17:01,635 --> 00:17:04,870
"Sheldon博士承诺戒除对于Howard Wolowitz
"Dr. Sheldon Cooper promises to abstain from all insulting or

403
00:17:04,872 --> 00:17:07,839
"的一切侮辱和不敬言论
"disrespectful language directed toward Howard Wolowitz,

404
00:17:07,841 --> 00:17:10,842
"包括但不限于对于工程学的嘲笑
"including but not limited to: mockery of engineering,

405
00:17:10,844 --> 00:17:12,444
"他的身高 头发 衣橱
"his height, his hair, his wardrobe,

00:17:12,446 --> 00:17:15,981
"以及他对于电影幽灵骑士的
"and his insane belief that the Ghost Rider movie

407
00:17:15,983 --> 00:17:19,017
"没那么糟"的评价
was, quote, 'not that bad.'"

408
00:17:20,721 --> 00:17:23,121
等等 或许应该加上
Hang on. Maybe there should be a "no insult" clause

409
00:17:23,123 --> 00:17:24,456
关于我的"禁止侮辱"条款
about me, too.

410
00:17:24,458 --> 00:17:26,591
- 你还喜欢香菜吗?  - 是啊 
- Do you still like cilantro?  - Yeah.

411
00:17:26,593 --> 00:17:28,393
那我做不到啊
You're tying my hands here.

412
00:17:30,130 --> 00:17:32,197
- 好吧 那我们签字吧  - 等等
- All right, let's sign this.  - Wait, wait, wait.

413
00:17:32,199 --> 00:17:34,232
第六页做了什么改动?
What are these changes on page six?

414
00:17:34,234 --> 00:17:35,534
Sheldon 你改了什么?
Sheldon, what did you do?

415
00:17:35,536 --> 00:17:36,368
我该知道的
I should've known.

416
00:17:36,370 --> 00:17:38,036
"Sheldon Cooper25%的收益
"25% of profits

417
00:17:38,038 --> 00:17:41,139
将被分配用于Howard 和 Bernadette Wolowitz夫妇
"due to Sheldon Cooper will be allocated to a scholarship fund

418
00:17:41,141 --> 00:17:44,876
第一个孩子的奖学金基金"
for the firstborn child of Howard and Bernadette Wolowitz""

419
00:17:45,713 --> 00:17:48,380
Sheldon 这真是太好了
Sheldon, that's so nice.

420
00:17:48,382 --> 00:17:49,448
这一条打败了
That beats

421
00:17:49,450 --> 00:17:51,049
我想在Gap给他们买的
the onesie I was gonna get them

422
00:17:51,051 --> 00:17:53,352
婴儿连体衣
from babyGap.

423
00:17:54,188 --> 00:17:56,888
Sheldon 这样真是太大方了
That's very generous, Sheldon.

424
00:17:56,890 --> 00:17:59,558
我一直觉得教育比金钱重要
Oh, I've always valued education over money.

425
00:17:59,560 --> 00:18:02,394
你需要书面文件以保证尊重
And the very fact that you needed a written guarantee

426
00:18:02,396 --> 00:18:03,829
让我意识到
of respect made me realize

427
00:18:03,831 --> 00:18:06,431
我对你的贡献多么轻视
how dismissive I've been of your contributions.

428
00:18:06,433 --> 00:18:09,134
我只是希望
I appreciate that. And I just hope

429
00:18:09,136 --> 00:18:12,671
这个奖学金可以让你们的小孩
that this scholarship can rescue your child

430
00:18:12,673 --> 00:18:14,272
免受低水平的教育
from the subpar education

431
00:18:14,274 --> 00:18:18,310
不要过工程师的枯燥生活
and menial life of an engineer.

432
00:18:19,713 --> 00:18:21,646
- Sheldon  - 咋啦
- Sheldon.  - What?

433
00:18:21,648 --> 00:18:23,849
这不是还没签字嘛
I didn't sign it yet.

434
00:18:32,348 --> 00:18:33,881
我明白你的意思
I hear what you're saying,

435
00:18:33,883 --> 00:18:35,482
但是我认识Emily很久了
but I've known Emily a long time,

436
00:18:35,484 --> 00:18:37,918
我觉得她跟别人不一样
and I think she deserves the benefit of the doubt.

437
00:18:37,920 --> 00:18:39,653
好吧 这是你自己的事
All right, it's your life.

438
00:18:39,655 --> 00:18:41,889
但是你知道结局会如何
But you know how this is gonna end.

439
00:18:41,891 --> 00:18:43,357
事实上 我很清楚
As a matter of fact, I do.

440
00:18:43,359 --> 00:18:45,526
我会去安慰她一下 因为我是一个在朋
I'm gonna comfort her, because I'm a caring

441
00:18:45,528 --> 00:18:47,494
友需要倾诉的时候乐于倾听
and decent friend who's happy to be there

442
00:18:47,496 --> 00:18:50,497
而且作风正派的人
when she needs someone to talk to.

443
00:18:50,499 --> 00:18:52,399
真是愉快的谈话
Good talk.
