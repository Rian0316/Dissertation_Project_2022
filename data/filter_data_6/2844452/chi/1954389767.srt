00:00:02,002 --> 00:00:04,269
      - WHOEVER TIPPED ME
       IN MONOPOLY MONEY

2
00:00:04,271 --> 00:00:06,438
    CAN GO DIRECTLY TO JAIL.

3
00:00:06,440 --> 00:00:08,807
          - A DOLLAR?

4
00:00:08,809 --> 00:00:11,744
           FAKE MONEY
AND THEY'RE STILL UNDER-TIPPING.

5
00:00:15,949 --> 00:00:17,349
            [laughs]

6
00:00:17,351 --> 00:00:19,284
          - OH, LOOK.
     I LOVE IT WHEN PEOPLE

00:00:19,286 --> 00:00:23,455
      DRESS GUINEA PIGS UP
     IN ADORABLE COSTUMES.

8
00:00:23,457 --> 00:00:25,357
- HAN, YOU LOOK LIKE BABE RUTH.

9
00:00:25,359 --> 00:00:28,794
        WELL, BABY RUTH.

10
00:00:28,796 --> 00:00:31,130
        - MAYBE YOU TWO
     CAN KISS MY SWEET ASS,

11
00:00:31,132 --> 00:00:34,566
     BECAUSE THIS OUTFIT'S
          A HOME RUN.

12
00:00:34,568 --> 00:00:37,236
  I'M PUTTING A TEAM TOGETHER
   FOR THE RESTAURANT LEAGUE.

13
00:00:37,238 --> 00:00:39,738
   - WELL, HAN, I WOULD PLAY,
         BUT YOU KNOW,

14
00:00:39,740 --> 00:00:41,073
    I'VE GOT THIS HIP THING,

15
00:00:41,075 --> 00:00:43,675
     MEANING, I'M TOO HIP.

16
00:00:43,677 --> 00:00:45,144
     - WHAT ABOUT YOU TWO?

17
00:00:45,146 --> 00:00:47,413
        I'M TELLING YOU,
    I'M A GREAT BALL PLAYER.

18
00:00:47,415 --> 00:00:49,581
             - NO,
    I'M A GREAT BALL PLAYER.

19
00:00:49,583 --> 00:00:53,485
  I KNOW HOW TO CUP AND TICKLE
     MINE AT THE SAME TIME.

20
00:00:53,487 --> 00:00:57,423
 - I'M TALKING ABOUT AMERICA'S
       FAVORITE PASTIME.

21
00:00:57,425 --> 00:00:59,792
         - OH, SO AM I.

22
00:01:02,829 --> 00:01:05,130
        - WELL, I'M IN.
   I HAVE A REALLY GOOD ARM.

23
00:01:05,132 --> 00:01:08,167
      GO OVER THERE, HAN.
   LET'S HAVE A LITTLE CATCH.

24
00:01:08,169 --> 00:01:11,003
     ALL RIGHT, HERE WE GO.
           ALL RIGHT.

25
00:01:11,005 --> 00:01:14,106
            GO DEEP.
        GO DEEPER, HAN.

26
00:01:14,108 --> 00:01:19,511
   - A PHRASE NO OTHER WOMAN
     WILL EVER SAY TO HIM.

27
00:01:19,513 --> 00:01:22,581
- THROW IT, AND DON'T BE AFRAID
       TO BRING THE HEAT.

28
00:01:25,251 --> 00:01:28,420
              OOH!

29
00:01:28,422 --> 00:01:30,756
        - TOO MUCH HEAT.

30
00:01:30,758 --> 00:01:34,493
     - BALL ONE...AND TWO.
           GAME OVER.

31
00:01:34,495 --> 00:01:38,997
   - I SEEM TO HAVE FORGOTTEN
 A CRUCIAL PART OF MY UNIFORM.

32
00:01:38,999 --> 00:01:41,600
       - NEED A CUP, HAN?

33
00:01:43,103 --> 00:01:45,270
   - ¶ OOH OOH OOH OOH OOH

           OOH OOH ¶

36
00:01:56,349 --> 00:01:57,783

       CAN WAIT IN HERE.

37
00:01:57,785 --> 00:02:01,153
   - BRIAN, BEFORE MY FATHER
 COMES IN, HOW ARE HIS SPIRITS?

38
00:02:01,155 --> 00:02:02,688
           YOU KNOW,
   FOR SOMEONE WHO'S LOOKING

39
00:02:02,690 --> 00:02:04,556
       AT 60 TO 100 YEARS
           IN PRISON?

40
00:02:04,558 --> 00:02:06,325
         - PRETTY GOOD.

41
00:02:06,327 --> 00:02:07,960
    I'LL BRING HIM RIGHT IN.

42
00:02:07,962 --> 00:02:10,262
          - HEY, BRI,
    ANYONE GET KILLED TODAY?

43
00:02:10,264 --> 00:02:12,931
 - YOU ASK ME THAT EVERY TIME,
MAX, AND EVERY TIME I TELL YOU,

44
00:02:12,933 --> 00:02:14,867
  IT'S A WHITE COLLAR PRISON.

  - GOT IT. ANYONE GET SHANKED
     WITH A MONT BLANC PEN?

    WITH A MIXTURE OF URINE
        AND FECES, SO--

49
00:02:24,778 --> 00:02:27,846
- MAX, PLEASE, CAN WE GO ONE DAY
  WITHOUT YOU MENTIONING THAT?

50
00:02:27,848 --> 00:02:29,948
      I WONDER WHY MY DAD
           WANTED US

51
00:02:29,950 --> 00:02:31,683
        TO RUSH OUT HERE
       AND SEE HIM TODAY.

52
00:02:31,685 --> 00:02:33,385
      - HE PROBABLY WANTS
       A CONJUGAL VISIT.

53
00:02:33,387 --> 00:02:35,120
             - MAX!

            WITH ME.

55
00:02:38,626 --> 00:02:41,226
       - THERE THEY ARE,
      THE LIGHT OF MY LIFE

56
00:02:41,228 --> 00:02:42,961
        AND HER BOUNCER.
          - HI, DADDY.

 LISTEN, I'M SORRY TO MAKE YOU
   COME ALL THE WAY OUT HERE

61
00:02:54,975 --> 00:03:00,445
  ON THE--GOD HELP ME--SUBWAY,
  BUT I ACTUALLY NEED A FAVOR.

62
00:03:01,614 --> 00:03:05,050
           [quietly]
       HELP ME BREAK OUT.

63
00:03:05,052 --> 00:03:06,485
          I'M KIDDING.

64
00:03:06,487 --> 00:03:08,654
    - DADDY, IT'S SO AMAZING
         YOU CAN JOKE,

65
00:03:08,656 --> 00:03:10,222
   BUT MAYBE NOT AROUND MAX.

66
00:03:10,224 --> 00:03:12,124
     SHE'S ALREADY OFFERED
     TO SKIN A GUARD ALIVE

67
00:03:12,126 --> 00:03:14,226
    AND WALK YOU OUT OF HERE
          WEARING HIM.

00:03:14,228 --> 00:03:17,162
   - WELL, WE KNOW IT WORKS.
           - [laughs]

69
00:03:17,164 --> 00:03:18,263
      - ALL RIGHT, LISTEN.

70
00:03:18,265 --> 00:03:19,531
           THIS WOMAN
    WHO USED TO WORK FOR ME

71
00:03:19,533 --> 00:03:21,333
         IS BEING PAID
       A MILLION DOLLARS

72
00:03:21,335 --> 00:03:23,802
    TO WRITE A TELL-ALL BOOK
           ABOUT ME.

73
00:03:23,804 --> 00:03:25,837
      - A MILLION DOLLARS?

74
00:03:25,839 --> 00:03:28,307
     HOW MUCH CAN I GET FOR
A TELL-ALL BOOK ABOUT CAROLINE?

75
00:03:28,309 --> 00:03:31,310
          CHAPTER ONE:
         "SLEEP FARTS."

76
00:03:31,312 --> 00:03:34,880
- MAX, PLEASE, CAN WE GO ONE DAY
  WITHOUT YOU MENTIONING THAT?

77
00:03:34,882 --> 00:03:37,816
       - THE WOMAN'S NAME
      IS SANDRA ROSENTHAL.

78
00:03:37,818 --> 00:03:39,084
           CAROLINE,
      DO YOU REMEMBER HER?

79
00:03:39,086 --> 00:03:41,053
         - YES, THE ONE
    WHO LIED ON HER RESUME.

80
00:03:41,055 --> 00:03:43,422
 THE ONE WHO COULDN'T EVEN ADD,
      AND WORSE THAN THAT,

81
00:03:43,424 --> 00:03:46,558
         SHE WORE BROWN
      WITH BLACK TOGETHER.

82
00:03:46,560 --> 00:03:48,493
    - I LIKE BROWN AND BLACK
           TOGETHER.

83
00:03:48,495 --> 00:03:51,029
           - I KNOW.

84
00:03:51,031 --> 00:03:54,099
    WAIT, WHY WOULD ANYBODY
    PAY THAT WOMAN SO MUCH?

85
00:03:54,101 --> 00:03:55,767
       WHAT IS SHE SAYING
        SHE HAS ON YOU?

86
00:03:55,769 --> 00:03:57,202
     - WELL, SHE'S CLAIMING
         SHE WAS FIRED

87
00:03:57,204 --> 00:03:58,670
        BECAUSE SHE HAD
      INSIDER INFORMATION

88
00:03:58,672 --> 00:04:00,505
    ABOUT THE PONZI SCANDAL,

89
00:04:00,507 --> 00:04:03,075
   AND THAT WE WERE SLEEPING
  TOGETHER, WHICH WE WEREN'T.

90
00:04:03,077 --> 00:04:04,843
    - OF COURSE YOU WEREN'T.
        YOU WOULD NEVER

91
00:04:04,845 --> 00:04:07,479
  SLEEP WITH SOMEONE WHO WORE
   BROWN WITH BLACK TOGETHER.

92
00:04:07,481 --> 00:04:09,481
     - MAN, I HAVEN'T SEEN
        THIS MUCH HATRED

93
00:04:09,483 --> 00:04:12,618
     TOWARD BROWN AND BLACK
        SINCE THE '50s.

94
00:04:12,620 --> 00:04:14,820
     - ANYWAY, I WANTED YOU
   TO HEAR IT FROM ME FIRST,

95
00:04:14,822 --> 00:04:16,822
   BECAUSE SHE'S ABOUT TO GO
     ON <i>PIERS MORGAN LIVE,</i>

96
00:04:16,824 --> 00:04:18,924
        AND SHE CAN SAY
      WHATEVER SHE WANTS.

97
00:04:18,926 --> 00:04:21,827
 - NO, SHE CAN'T, BECAUSE I'LL
  BE THERE TO REFUTE HER LIES.

98
00:04:21,829 --> 00:04:23,695
        I'LL DEFEND YOU
     WITH DIGNITY AND CLASS

99
00:04:23,697 --> 00:04:27,266
      AND MY NEW LIPSTICK
  I JUST FOUND ON THE SUBWAY.

100
00:04:27,268 --> 00:04:30,035
      - WOW, PIERS MORGAN.
       THAT DUDE'S LEGIT.

101
00:04:30,037 --> 00:04:34,106
        HE'S GOT A SHOW,
   HE'S GOT PIERS 1 IMPORTS.

102
00:04:34,108 --> 00:04:37,142
   - I DON'T KNOW WHAT I'D DO
     WITHOUT YOU, PRINCESS.

103
00:04:37,144 --> 00:04:39,878
     YOU'RE THE ONLY PERSON
          I CAN TRUST.

104
00:04:39,880 --> 00:04:41,613
     NOW, GET OUT OF HERE,
  'CAUSE I GOTTA SPEAK TO MAX

          - OH...SURE.

107
00:04:45,219 --> 00:04:46,451
           OKAY, I--
           - JUST GO.

108
00:04:46,453 --> 00:04:49,955

        TO ME PRIVATELY.

109
00:04:49,957 --> 00:04:51,623
      - LOVE YOU, SWEETIE.
       - LOVE YOU, DADDY.

110
00:04:51,625 --> 00:04:53,825

00:04:57,297 --> 00:04:58,964
          - SO, MAX...

113

             RIGHT?

114
00:05:01,702 --> 00:05:03,769
          - I NEED YOU
   TO TELL CAROLINE SOMETHING

115
00:05:03,771 --> 00:05:06,972
    I COULDN'T BRING MYSELF
            TO SAY.

116
00:05:06,974 --> 00:05:08,907
  THIS WOMAN IS ALSO CLAIMING

117
00:05:08,909 --> 00:05:12,878
     I HAVE A SMALL PENIS.

118
00:05:12,880 --> 00:05:14,813
            - WAIT.

119
00:05:14,815 --> 00:05:19,718
       SO I STAYED BEHIND
           TO SEE IT?

120
00:05:19,720 --> 00:05:23,121
             - NO.

121
00:05:23,123 --> 00:05:26,725
  I WANT YOU TO TELL CAROLINE
     SO SHE'LL BE PREPARED,

122
00:05:26,727 --> 00:05:28,260
     'CAUSE I'M PRETTY SURE
         THAT'S THE LIE

123
00:05:28,262 --> 00:05:29,761
    THAT GOT THE BOOK SOLD.

124
00:05:29,763 --> 00:05:31,797
      - HOW BIG OF A LIE?

125
00:05:31,799 --> 00:05:36,802
    - OH, A REALLY BIG ONE.

126
00:05:39,739 --> 00:05:42,674
- SO WHAT DID YOU AND MY FATHER
          TALK ABOUT?

127
00:05:42,676 --> 00:05:44,776
  - I DON'T WANT TO TELL YOU.
       I'M UNCOMFORTABLE.

128
00:05:44,778 --> 00:05:47,179
    -  <i>YOU'RE</i>UNCOMFORTABLE?

129
00:05:47,181 --> 00:05:48,747
       THIS MUST BE BAD.

130
00:05:48,749 --> 00:05:50,515
YOU'VE NEVER BEEN UNCOMFORTABLE
         IN YOUR LIFE.

131
00:05:50,517 --> 00:05:52,784
      IS IT DRUGS? CANCER?

132
00:05:52,786 --> 00:05:54,853
    OH! DID HE FALL IN LOVE
           IN PRISON?

133
00:05:54,855 --> 00:05:56,488
     I'LL BE FINE WITH IT.
        YOU CAN TELL ME.

134
00:05:56,490 --> 00:05:58,190
       WHEN WE HAD MONEY,
       I WAS VERY ACTIVE

135
00:05:58,192 --> 00:06:02,260
  IN THE PARK AVENUE STRAIGHTS
   FOR GAY DOORMEN ALLIANCE.

137

           - IS THIS
    SOME KIND OF WEIRD GANG,

138
00:06:09,269 --> 00:06:11,203
         OR DID A GAME
         JUST LET OUT?

139
00:06:11,205 --> 00:06:13,171
        - MAX, COME ON.
            TELL ME.

     MY FATHER HAS A WHAT?

144
00:06:23,951 --> 00:06:25,350
       - HE HAS A SMALL--

145
00:06:25,352 --> 00:06:27,085
         [horn blares]

146
00:06:27,087 --> 00:06:29,187
          - SERIOUSLY,
        THE GAME'S OVER.

147
00:06:29,189 --> 00:06:32,190
   AND HOW ON EARTH YOU HAVE
  A WEDDING RING IS BEYOND ME.

148
00:06:32,192 --> 00:06:33,525
     WHAT IS SHE GONNA SAY
           ABOUT HIM?

149
00:06:33,527 --> 00:06:35,627
        [horns blaring]

150
00:06:35,629 --> 00:06:38,730
       I CAN'T HEAR YOU!
    - SHE'S GOING TO SAY...

151
00:06:38,732 --> 00:06:42,901
        YOUR FATHER HAS
         A SMALL PENIS!

152
00:06:42,903 --> 00:06:45,604
HE THOUGHT IT'D BE LESS AWKWARD
         IF I TOLD YOU.

153
00:06:45,606 --> 00:06:46,905
            WAS IT?

154
00:06:46,907 --> 00:06:49,408
       - I CAN'T BELIEVE
  THAT SANDRA ROSENTHAL WOMAN.

155
00:06:49,410 --> 00:06:51,643
      THERE'S ANOTHER LIE.
    - WHY, HAVE YOU SEEN IT?

156
00:06:51,645 --> 00:06:54,246
    - NO, I HAVEN'T SEEN IT!
    I NEVER WANT TO SEE IT.

157
00:06:54,248 --> 00:06:56,047
         HAVE YOU SEEN
      YOUR FATHER'S PENIS?

158
00:06:56,049 --> 00:06:58,617
          - IF I DID,
    IT WAS WAVING GOOD-BYE.

159
00:07:04,323 --> 00:07:05,690
   - MAX, I'VE THOUGHT A LOT
           ABOUT IT,

160
00:07:05,692 --> 00:07:07,292
     AND I CAN'T SIT THERE
        WHILE THAT WOMAN

161
00:07:07,294 --> 00:07:10,462
    WAVES MY FATHER'S PENIS
    IN PIERS MORGAN'S FACE.

162
00:07:10,464 --> 00:07:12,531
         - YOU'RE LUCKY
   IT'S NOT ANDERSON COOPER,

163
00:07:12,533 --> 00:07:15,200
         'CAUSE HE'D BE
      GIGGLING UP A STORM.

164
00:07:15,202 --> 00:07:16,802
        - I HAVE A PLAN.

165
00:07:16,804 --> 00:07:19,538
MY GOAL ON THIS SHOW IS GONNA BE
    TO DISCREDIT THAT WOMAN

166
00:07:19,540 --> 00:07:21,973
  AND TELL PEOPLE, EVEN THOUGH
   MY FATHER DID A BAD THING,

167
00:07:21,975 --> 00:07:23,742
  HE DID SOME WONDERFUL THINGS
            AS WELL.

168
00:07:23,744 --> 00:07:26,511
        LOOK, HERE HE IS
      WORKING WITH UNICEF.

169
00:07:26,513 --> 00:07:29,114
           HERE HE IS
       REBUILDING HAITI.

170
00:07:29,116 --> 00:07:31,650
OH, THIS IS JUST A CUTE PICTURE
      OF HIM WATER-SKIING

171
00:07:31,652 --> 00:07:33,385
       AT A CHARITY EVENT
         ON LAKE TAHOE.

172
00:07:33,387 --> 00:07:37,055
     - WHAT'S THE CHARITY?
 WHITE MEN WITHOUT GOLF CLUBS?

173
00:07:37,057 --> 00:07:39,024
      - SO THAT'S MY PLAN,
         AND HOPEFULLY,

174
00:07:39,026 --> 00:07:40,492
       GOING ON THAT SHOW
        WILL PUT AN END

175
00:07:40,494 --> 00:07:43,028
 TO ALL THESE RIDICULOUS RUMORS
        ABOUT MY FATHER.

176
00:07:43,030 --> 00:07:47,899
        - HEY, CAROLINE.

177
00:07:47,901 --> 00:07:50,268
             YEAH.

178
00:07:50,270 --> 00:07:54,005
     THE WORD ON THE STREET
  IS YOUR DAD'S GOT A WEENIS.

179
00:07:54,007 --> 00:07:56,508
   - SOPHIE, HOW DID YOU HEAR
          ABOUT THAT?

180
00:07:56,510 --> 00:07:58,243
        - OLEG TOLD ME.

181
00:07:58,245 --> 00:08:01,146
          - IT CAME UP
   ON MY GOOGLE PENIS ALERTS.

182
00:08:01,148 --> 00:08:03,815
    I LIKE TO KEEP CURRENT,
    SEE WHAT THE TRENDS ARE.

183
00:08:03,817 --> 00:08:05,584
      YOU DON'T WANT TO BE
      THAT MIDDLE-AGED GUY

184
00:08:05,586 --> 00:08:08,653
     WEARING THE SAME PENIS
    YOU HAD IN HIGH SCHOOL.

185
00:08:08,655 --> 00:08:11,389
         - GREAT, NOW,
   IT'S ALL OVER THE INTERNET

186
00:08:11,391 --> 00:08:13,625
        AND MY SHOULDERS
   ARE ALL UP AROUND MY EARS.

187
00:08:13,627 --> 00:08:16,328
      LOOK, I'M TOO TENSE
   TO EVEN SHAKE MY HEAD "NO"

188
00:08:16,330 --> 00:08:19,331
      AT THAT LIAR WOMAN,
WHICH WAS GONNA BE MY KEY MOVE.

189
00:08:19,333 --> 00:08:22,667
       I NEED A MASSAGE,
         BUT I'M BROKE.

190
00:08:22,669 --> 00:08:25,003
          - CAROLINE,
    I'LL GIVE YOU A MASSAGE.

191
00:08:25,005 --> 00:08:28,406
 - GET READY FOR A SAD ENDING.

192
00:08:28,408 --> 00:08:32,277
   AND BEGINNING, AND MIDDLE.

193
00:08:32,279 --> 00:08:33,879
            - THERE.

194
00:08:33,881 --> 00:08:36,214
           OH, YEAH.

195
00:08:36,216 --> 00:08:38,016
      HOW DOES THAT FEEL?

196
00:08:38,018 --> 00:08:42,354
      - LIKE BABY SPIDERS
  ARE DANCING ON MY SHOULDERS.

197
00:08:42,356 --> 00:08:44,589
    - YOU'RE THE FIRST ASIAN
           I'VE SEEN

198
00:08:44,591 --> 00:08:47,225
   THAT CAN'T GIVE A MASSAGE.

199
00:08:50,329 --> 00:08:53,098
         HEY, CAROLINE,
     I'LL TREAT YOU AND MAX

200
00:08:53,100 --> 00:08:55,200
          TO A MASSAGE
        AT MY FANCY SPA.

201
00:08:55,202 --> 00:08:57,569
        - [gasps] COOL!
   I'VE NEVER BEEN TO A SPA.

202
00:08:57,571 --> 00:08:59,337
     THE CLOSEST I'VE BEEN
       IS STICKING MY ARM

203
00:08:59,339 --> 00:09:02,841
   IN THE FREE BLOOD PRESSURE
     MACHINE AT WALGREENS.

204
00:09:02,843 --> 00:09:07,012
  - WAIT, THAT'S FOR YOUR ARM?

205
00:09:10,683 --> 00:09:13,051
 - THANKS FOR THE MASSAGE, HAN.
       IT WAS VERY NICE--

206
00:09:13,053 --> 00:09:15,620
   OH, YOU'RE STILL DOING IT.
         I HAD NO IDEA.

207
00:09:20,226 --> 00:09:24,429
      - THAT WAS A-MAZING!

208
00:09:24,431 --> 00:09:26,765
    I MEAN, A GUY RUBBED ME
          FOR AN HOUR

209
00:09:26,767 --> 00:09:29,935
       AND DIDN'T EXPECT
         ANYTHING BACK?

210
00:09:29,937 --> 00:09:33,071
       THIS MASSAGE STUFF
        COULD CATCH ON.

211
00:09:33,073 --> 00:09:36,641
      - I COULD NOT LET GO
       DURING MY MASSAGE.

212
00:09:36,643 --> 00:09:39,544
      - OH, WAS LETTING GO
           AN OPTION?

213
00:09:39,546 --> 00:09:41,880
 I WAS CLOSE, BUT I DIDN'T WANT
      TO GET HALFWAY THERE

214
00:09:41,882 --> 00:09:44,482
    AND HAVE THE MANAGEMENT
   THROW ME OUT OR SOMETHING.

215
00:09:44,484 --> 00:09:45,984
      - I'M JUST SO TENSE.

216
00:09:45,986 --> 00:09:47,919
       PIERS MORGAN ASKS
   SOME DIFFICULT QUESTIONS.

217
00:09:47,921 --> 00:09:50,422
      LAST WEEK, HE ASKED
    THE    <i>SPRING BREAKE</i>CAST

218
00:09:50,424 --> 00:09:53,592
         THEIR THOUGHTS
 ON THE NORTH KOREA SITUATION.

219
00:09:53,594 --> 00:09:54,826
             - SHH!

220
00:09:54,828 --> 00:09:56,394
            - SORRY.

221
00:09:56,396 --> 00:09:59,130
   MAX, THIS IS A QUIET ROOM.
      WE HAVE TO BE QUIET.

222
00:09:59,132 --> 00:10:01,633
          - HI, GIRLS!

223
00:10:01,635 --> 00:10:05,003
     OH, I'M GETTING MYSELF
       SOME FANCY WATER.

224
00:10:05,005 --> 00:10:08,673
     LOOK, THEY GOT LEMON,
     ORANGE, AND CUCUMBER.

225
00:10:08,675 --> 00:10:12,644
  HA! IT'S LIKE A SLOT MACHINE
           OVER HERE.

226
00:10:12,646 --> 00:10:15,046
             - SHH!

227
00:10:19,585 --> 00:10:23,421
        - OH, I JUST HAD
    THE BEST BAMBOO MASSAGE.

228
00:10:23,423 --> 00:10:25,490
   OH, THEY KEPT WHACKING ME
            WITH IT

229
00:10:25,492 --> 00:10:30,395
 UNTIL I CONFESSED TO STEALING
  THAT BREAD WHEN I WAS SEVEN.

230
00:10:30,397 --> 00:10:33,164
      OH, WHAT A LOAD OFF.

231
00:10:33,166 --> 00:10:36,635
    CAROLINE, YOU STILL LOOK
        A LITTLE TENSE,

232
00:10:36,637 --> 00:10:39,304
   BUT I GUESS HAVING TO TALK
    ABOUT YOUR FATHER'S JUNK

233
00:10:39,306 --> 00:10:43,642
     ON NATIONAL TELEVISION
    WILL DO THAT TO A GIRL.

234
00:10:43,644 --> 00:10:46,277
    - I WILL NOT BE SPEAKING
    ABOUT MY FATHER'S "JUNK"

235
00:10:46,279 --> 00:10:47,679
         ON TELEVISION.

236
00:10:47,681 --> 00:10:50,649
    - NO, I CAN'T HAVE LUNCH
           TOMORROW.

237
00:10:50,651 --> 00:10:53,752
           I'M DOING
        <i>PIERS MORGAN LIVE.</i>

238
00:10:55,354 --> 00:10:58,289
      - YOU WON'T BELIEVE
      WHAT JUST HAPPENED.

239
00:10:58,291 --> 00:11:01,226
          - YOU JOINED
        A DEMONIC CULT?

240
00:11:01,228 --> 00:11:03,528
   - SANDRA, THE LIAR WRITING
       THE TELL-ALL BOOK,

241
00:11:03,530 --> 00:11:05,397
        JUST WALKED IN.
           - [gasps]

242
00:11:05,399 --> 00:11:07,932
         SHE'S GETTING
      A DAY OF BEAUTY TOO?

243
00:11:07,934 --> 00:11:11,436
THIS IS LIKE THE GAYEST TRAINING
       FOR A FIGHT EVER.

244
00:11:11,438 --> 00:11:13,605
           - SANDRA?

245
00:11:13,607 --> 00:11:15,140
        RIGHT THIS WAY.

246
00:11:15,142 --> 00:11:16,808
         LAY FACE DOWN.

247
00:11:16,810 --> 00:11:19,210
  I'LL GIVE YOU A FEW MINUTES
   AND I'LL BE RIGHT BACK IN.

248
00:11:19,212 --> 00:11:21,146
           - PERFECT.
  I REALLY NEED THIS MASSAGE.

249
00:11:21,148 --> 00:11:23,081
     PROMOTING MY NEW BOOK
         IS EXHAUSTING.

250
00:11:23,083 --> 00:11:24,649
           I'M SORRY
    IF THAT SOUNDED BRAGGY,

251
00:11:24,651 --> 00:11:26,084
          BUT I GUESS
      THAT'S HOW YOU SOUND

252
00:11:26,086 --> 00:11:28,386
     WHEN THINGS ARE GOING
       SO GREAT FOR YOU.

253
00:11:28,388 --> 00:11:31,322
   - UGH! THAT POOR MASSEUSE
       IS GONNA BE FORCED

254
00:11:31,324 --> 00:11:33,825
   TO LISTEN TO HER YAMMER ON
      ABOUT HER DUMB BOOK.

255
00:11:33,827 --> 00:11:36,261
      BUT THEN AGAIN, MINE
 HAD TO HEAR ME CONSTANTLY SAY,

256
00:11:36,263 --> 00:11:40,165
        "DON'T BE AFRAID
         OF THE BOOBS."

257
00:11:40,167 --> 00:11:42,934
     - WE SHOULD BE HEARING
      ABOUT THAT DUMB BOOK

258
00:11:42,936 --> 00:11:44,502
           SO I KNOW
      WHAT I'M UP AGAINST.

259
00:11:44,504 --> 00:11:47,105
    IF THERE WAS ONLY A WAY
      TO GET IN THAT ROOM.

260
00:11:47,107 --> 00:11:52,744
   - OH, ANYONE CAN GET INTO
ANY ROOM IF THEY REALLY WANT TO.

261
00:11:52,746 --> 00:11:54,846
      I MEAN, DO YOU THINK
       THAT I WAS INVITED

262
00:11:54,848 --> 00:11:58,249
        TO THE AUDITION
    FOR THE 2004 BOAT SHOW?

263
00:11:58,251 --> 00:12:00,452
             YEAH.
              GO.

264
00:12:00,454 --> 00:12:02,687
         I'LL TAKE CARE
       OF THAT MASSEUSE.

265
00:12:02,689 --> 00:12:04,889
   - SOPHIE, YOU'RE NOT GONNA
        HURT HER, RIGHT?

266
00:12:04,891 --> 00:12:08,560
      - NO. I'M GONNA TRY
       TIPPING HER FIRST.

267
00:12:16,936 --> 00:12:19,437
          - I'M BACK.

268
00:12:19,439 --> 00:12:21,840
        YES, I WAS JUST
   OUT IN THE HALL WITH YOU,

269
00:12:21,842 --> 00:12:24,342
         NOW, HERE I AM
     IN THE ROOM WITH YOU,

270
00:12:24,344 --> 00:12:26,911
        THE SAME PERSON.

271
00:12:26,913 --> 00:12:32,217
   JUST KEEP YOUR HEAD DOWN,
   DON'T LOOK UP, AND RELAX.

272
00:12:32,219 --> 00:12:34,185
 - YOU'RE NOT GONNA TALK A LOT,
            ARE YOU?

273
00:12:34,187 --> 00:12:37,021
      - NO, BUT YOU SHOULD
         FEEL FREE TO.

274
00:12:37,023 --> 00:12:39,891
    WHATEVER'S ON YOUR MIND
      OR IN IN THAT BOOK.

275
00:12:39,893 --> 00:12:41,292
       [chimes jingling]
            - WHAT?

276
00:12:41,294 --> 00:12:42,861
         WHAT WAS THAT?

277
00:12:42,863 --> 00:12:44,162
            - THAT?

278
00:12:44,164 --> 00:12:46,364
     THAT'S JUST ME, ALONE,

279
00:12:46,366 --> 00:12:49,200
    CREATING A HEALING SPACE
     WITH ENERGY AND SOUND.

280
00:12:49,202 --> 00:12:50,568
       [chimes jingling]

281
00:12:50,570 --> 00:12:53,371
         LOTS OF SOUND.

282
00:12:53,373 --> 00:12:56,274
       SO YOU'RE WRITING
          A BIG BOOK.

283
00:12:56,276 --> 00:12:58,943
     DO YOU WANT TO TELL ME
        ALL ABOUT THAT?

284
00:12:58,945 --> 00:13:01,146
  - WELL, IT'S ABOUT THIS GUY,
        MARTIN CHANNING.

285
00:13:01,148 --> 00:13:06,484
     - OH, HE IS VERY NICE
     AND VERY RESPECTABLE.

286
00:13:06,486 --> 00:13:08,486
     - YOU WON'T THINK THAT
    AFTER YOU READ MY BOOK.

287
00:13:08,488 --> 00:13:10,889
       I AM REALLY GONNA
        STICK IT TO HIM.

288
00:13:10,891 --> 00:13:12,624
           OKAY, NOW,
    YOU'RE JUST PUSHING ME.

289
00:13:12,626 --> 00:13:14,692
              UGH!

290
00:13:15,828 --> 00:13:18,396
       UH, HOW DID YOU--

291
00:13:21,667 --> 00:13:26,204
           UH...HOW--
      HOW DID YOU DO THAT?

292
00:13:26,206 --> 00:13:29,274
         IT FEELS LIKE
     YOU HAVE THREE HANDS.

293
00:13:32,845 --> 00:13:36,347
    - THAT'S HOW GOOD I AM.

294
00:13:36,349 --> 00:13:38,750
    - THIS IS SUPPOSED TO BE
      A HOT STONE MASSAGE.

295
00:13:38,752 --> 00:13:40,718
       - COMIN' RIGHT UP.

296
00:13:40,720 --> 00:13:42,554
       [chimes jingling]

297
00:13:42,556 --> 00:13:44,622
        THE HOT STONES.

298
00:13:47,526 --> 00:13:50,261
       [chimes jingling]
             - OH!

299
00:13:52,765 --> 00:13:56,668
     - ALL RIGHT, HERE COME
      THE HO-O-OT STONES.

300
00:13:58,337 --> 00:14:00,271
             - OH!

301
00:14:00,273 --> 00:14:03,341
           OH, YEAH.
       YEAH, THAT'S NICE.

302
00:14:03,343 --> 00:14:04,943
    I'M REALLY LOOSENING UP.

303
00:14:04,945 --> 00:14:06,945
     - OH, WELL, THEN LET'S
    LOOSEN YOU UP SOME MORE.

304
00:14:06,947 --> 00:14:08,179
          MORE STONES.

305
00:14:08,181 --> 00:14:09,447
       - [mouthing words]

306
00:14:09,449 --> 00:14:11,783
         - MORE STONES!

307
00:14:15,187 --> 00:14:18,590
   - YEAH, I'M GOT PAID A LOT
 OF MONEY FOR MY TELL-ALL BOOK,

308
00:14:18,592 --> 00:14:20,859
     AND I AM REALLY GONNA
           TELL ALL.

309
00:14:20,861 --> 00:14:25,430
         OH! NOT THERE!
           NOT THERE.

310
00:14:25,432 --> 00:14:27,699
             WHAT?
   WHAT IS GOING ON IN HERE?

311
00:14:27,701 --> 00:14:30,134
        - WELL, WHAT IS
    HAPPENING HERE, SANDRA,

312
00:14:30,136 --> 00:14:32,003
     IS YOU'RE ABOUT TO GO
         ON NATIONAL TV

313
00:14:32,005 --> 00:14:33,771
     AND TELL AMERICA LIES
        ABOUT MY FATHER.

314
00:14:33,773 --> 00:14:35,173
    HE NEVER SLEPT WITH YOU.

315
00:14:35,175 --> 00:14:38,276
- OH. DID HE NEVER SLEEP WITH ME
        IN YOUR BEDROOM,

316
00:14:38,278 --> 00:14:40,945
    ON YOUR PINK CANOPY BED?

317
00:14:40,947 --> 00:14:43,314
        - YOU KNOW WHAT?
      THAT NEVER HAPPENED.

318
00:14:43,316 --> 00:14:45,283
         THAT'S INSANE.
         YOU'RE CRAZY.

319
00:14:45,285 --> 00:14:46,851
      - WELL, IT'S MY WORD
         AGAINST YOURS.

320
00:14:46,853 --> 00:14:49,287
        YOU'RE GONNA BE
    VERY EMBARRASSED ON TV.

321
00:14:49,289 --> 00:14:51,823
BUT NOT AS EMBARRASSED AS YOU'RE
 GOING TO BE IN THE SPA LOBBY,

322
00:14:51,825 --> 00:14:54,726
   WHEN I TELL EVERYONE THAT
 I WAS TOUCHED INAPPROPRIATELY

323
00:14:54,728 --> 00:14:56,628
     BY CAROLINE CHANNING.

324
00:14:56,630 --> 00:14:58,897
      - YOU ARE NOT GONNA
       TELL ANYBODY THAT.

325
00:14:58,899 --> 00:15:00,531
     - WHO'S GONNA STOP ME?

326
00:15:00,533 --> 00:15:02,200
         - HEY, GIRLS.

327
00:15:02,202 --> 00:15:04,469
        I WAS LISTENING
       OUTSIDE THE DOOR.

328
00:15:04,471 --> 00:15:08,106
          [low voice]
        EVERYTHING OKAY?

329
00:15:14,613 --> 00:15:16,514
      - MAX, I DON'T KNOW
       IF I CAN DO THIS.

330
00:15:16,516 --> 00:15:18,149
        WHAT IF SANDRA'S
       TELLING THE TRUTH?

331
00:15:18,151 --> 00:15:19,884
          SHE DID KNOW
   ABOUT MY PINK CANOPY BED.

332
00:15:19,886 --> 00:15:21,519
    HOW WOULD SHE KNOW THAT?

333
00:15:21,521 --> 00:15:24,222
    - BECAUSE EVERYONE KNOWS
 BARBIE COMES WITH A DREAM CAR,

334
00:15:24,224 --> 00:15:27,392
 A PONY, AND A PINK CANOPY BED
           INCLUDED.

335
00:15:27,394 --> 00:15:30,728
         - THERE HE IS.
  THERE'S PIERS MORGAN, LIVE.

336
00:15:30,730 --> 00:15:32,130
           - [gasps]

337
00:15:32,132 --> 00:15:33,631
          DO YOU THINK
    IT'S TOO SOON TO ASK HIM

338
00:15:33,633 --> 00:15:36,367
     TO GIVE ME A DISCOUNT
          AT PIERS 1?

339
00:15:36,369 --> 00:15:40,238
- HE LOOKS DIGNIFIED, LIKE HE'S
  NOT GONNA ASK ABOUT A PENIS.

340
00:15:40,240 --> 00:15:43,041
      BUT WHAT IF HE DOES?
     MAX, I CAN'T DO THIS.

341
00:15:43,043 --> 00:15:44,842
     - GIVE ME YOUR PHONE.

342
00:15:44,844 --> 00:15:46,411
            YOU NEED
       TO REMIND YOURSELF

343
00:15:46,413 --> 00:15:48,346
   OF THE PERSON YOUR FATHER
          USED TO BE.

344
00:15:48,348 --> 00:15:50,648
        LOOK, HERE HE IS
      WORKING WITH UNICEF.

345
00:15:50,650 --> 00:15:54,319
  AND HERE HE IS WATER-SKIING
     ON "LAKE RICH PERSON."

346
00:15:54,321 --> 00:15:57,989
      LOOK AT THAT SMILE.
 IS THAT THE SMILE OF--HOLD UP.

347
00:15:57,991 --> 00:16:00,725
       WHOA, WHOA, WHOA.

348
00:16:00,727 --> 00:16:05,263
      WHAT'S COMING OUT OF
THE LEFT LEG OF HIS SWIM SHORTS?

349
00:16:05,265 --> 00:16:07,265
   I THINK YOUR FATHER'S JUNK
      IS TRYING TO TELL ME

350
00:16:07,267 --> 00:16:10,301
        THERE'S GONNA BE
   SIX MORE WEEKS OF WINTER.

351
00:16:10,303 --> 00:16:12,470
     - WHAT ARE YOU SAYING?

352
00:16:12,472 --> 00:16:15,473
         - I'M SAYING,
    SOMEONE HAD A TIP SLIP,

353
00:16:15,475 --> 00:16:19,143
        AND THAT IS NOT
          A SMALL TIP.

354
00:16:19,145 --> 00:16:21,312
       AND AS A WAITRESS
       AND A LOOSE WOMAN,

355
00:16:21,314 --> 00:16:24,849
       I KNOW A SMALL TIP
        WHEN I SEE ONE.

356
00:16:24,851 --> 00:16:27,752
             HERE.
             - OH!

357
00:16:28,954 --> 00:16:30,855
         SORRY, SORRY.

358
00:16:30,857 --> 00:16:34,559
  SHE JUST SHOWED ME A PICTURE
OF ANNE HATHAWAY'S NEW HAIRCUT.

359
00:16:37,463 --> 00:16:40,631
  WELL, THIS IS GOOD, BECAUSE
 IT PROVES THAT WOMAN IS LYING.

360
00:16:40,633 --> 00:16:42,834
    - YEP, YOU JUST HAVE TO
      SHOW THIS TO PIERS.

361
00:16:42,836 --> 00:16:47,271
     - I TOLD YOU, I'M NOT
 GOING NEAR MY FATHER'S PENIS.

362
00:16:47,273 --> 00:16:48,940
        ALL I HAVE TO DO
          IS POINT OUT

363
00:16:48,942 --> 00:16:50,975
        THAT THAT WOMAN
     HAS NO FINANCE SKILLS.

364
00:16:50,977 --> 00:16:53,144
          UNLIKE HER,
  WE ARE TAKING THE HIGH ROAD.

365
00:16:53,146 --> 00:16:55,380
   MAX, ARE YOU SENDING THAT
          TO YOURSELF?

366
00:16:59,718 --> 00:17:01,252
           - I'M HERE
     WITH SANDRA ROSENTHAL,

367
00:17:01,254 --> 00:17:02,854
       WHO'S JUST SIGNED
        A HUGE BOOK DEAL

368
00:17:02,856 --> 00:17:04,088
     TO DO A KISS-AND-TELL

369
00:17:04,090 --> 00:17:06,257
     ON DISGRACED FINANCIER
        MARTIN CHANNING.

370
00:17:06,259 --> 00:17:07,358
    WELCOME TO YOU, SANDRA.

371
00:17:07,360 --> 00:17:08,559
        - HELLO, PIERS.

372
00:17:08,561 --> 00:17:10,695
   THANK YOU FOR ALLOWING ME
       TO TELL MY STORY.

373
00:17:10,697 --> 00:17:12,597
   - IT'S A STORY, ALL RIGHT.

374
00:17:12,599 --> 00:17:15,099
 - WOW, SO WE'RE RIGHT INTO IT.
  OKAY, WELL, LET ME CATCH UP.

375
00:17:15,101 --> 00:17:16,934
         MY OTHER GUEST
     IS CAROLINE CHANNING,

376
00:17:16,936 --> 00:17:19,537
  DAUGHTER OF MARTIN CHANNING,
     WHO, TO PUT IT MILDLY,

377
00:17:19,539 --> 00:17:21,739
  IS CLAIMING THAT YOUR BOOK,
         MS. ROSENTHAL,

378
00:17:21,741 --> 00:17:23,541
      IS A BUNCH OF BULL.

379
00:17:23,543 --> 00:17:24,876
     - THAT'S RIGHT, PIERS.

380
00:17:24,878 --> 00:17:26,110
        [English accent]
       IT'S PURE RUBBISH,

381
00:17:26,112 --> 00:17:27,879
         [normal voice]
      AS YOUR PEOPLE SAY.

382
00:17:27,881 --> 00:17:32,283
 - THAT WAS PERFECTLY AMERICAN.

383
00:17:32,285 --> 00:17:33,785
          RIGHT, THEN,
     LET ME START WITH YOU.

384
00:17:33,787 --> 00:17:35,319
  WELL, TO CATCH EVERYBODY UP,
        MS. ROSENTHAL'S

385
00:17:35,321 --> 00:17:37,288
   LARGE BOOK ADVANCE REALLY
    HAS TO DO WITH SOMETHING

386
00:17:37,290 --> 00:17:40,625
     THAT TURNED OUT TO BE,
   BY YOUR WORDS, VERY SMALL.

387
00:17:40,627 --> 00:17:41,926
    COMMENTS, MS. CHANNING?

388
00:17:41,928 --> 00:17:45,563
         - PSST! PSST!

389
00:17:45,565 --> 00:17:47,832
    - I'D RATHER NOT COMMENT
       ABOUT THAT, PIERS,

390
00:17:47,834 --> 00:17:49,901
     BECAUSE I HAVE CLASS,
    BUT I DO HAVE A QUESTION

391
00:17:49,903 --> 00:17:52,403
       FOR MS. ROSENTHAL,
   WHO WAS HIRED BY MY FATHER

392
00:17:52,405 --> 00:17:54,639
      BECAUSE SHE CLAIMED
  SHE HAD A DEGREE IN FINANCE.

393
00:17:54,641 --> 00:17:57,975
   MS. ROSENTHAL, IF A TRAIN
     CARRYING 27 PASSENGERS

394
00:17:57,977 --> 00:18:00,378
  LEAVES GRAND CENTRAL STATION
         AT 9:00 A.M.,

395
00:18:00,380 --> 00:18:04,015
 TRAVELS 800 MILES TO CHICAGO,
     ARRIVING AT 5:00 P.M.,

396
00:18:04,017 --> 00:18:06,184
   HOW FAST WAS IT TRAVELING?

397
00:18:06,186 --> 00:18:07,485
          - WELL, I--

398
00:18:07,487 --> 00:18:09,153
     - SIMPLE MATH, PIERS.

399
00:18:09,155 --> 00:18:11,889
      - 100 MILES AN HOUR.
          - I'M SORRY?

400
00:18:11,891 --> 00:18:15,059
     - THAT'S YOUR ANSWER.
SORRY, I'M A BIT OF A MATHLETE.

401
00:18:15,061 --> 00:18:16,494
         - IMPRESSIVE.

402
00:18:16,496 --> 00:18:18,696
   - I'VE GOT A MATH EQUATION
            FOR YOU.

403
00:18:18,698 --> 00:18:21,532
       IF A 3-INCH TRAIN
     IS ENTERING A TUNNEL,

404
00:18:21,534 --> 00:18:24,602
   DO I EVEN KNOW IT'S THERE?

405
00:18:24,604 --> 00:18:26,571
      - LADIES, THIS ISN'T
          <i>MAURY POVICH.</i>

406
00:18:26,573 --> 00:18:28,773
         - PSST! PSST!

407
00:18:28,775 --> 00:18:30,608
      - PIERS, I AM SIMPLY
      TRYING TO ILLUSTRATE

408
00:18:30,610 --> 00:18:32,176
      THAT SHE SHOULD HAVE
    BEEN ABLE TO ANSWER IT,

409
00:18:32,178 --> 00:18:36,714
     HAD SHE BEEN QUALIFIED
    FOR HER JOB IN FINANCE.

410
00:18:36,716 --> 00:18:39,283
 - EVERYTHING THAT I AM WRITING
  IN THE BOOK IS TRUE, PIERS.

411
00:18:39,285 --> 00:18:41,119
        THERE IS NOTHING
        THAT I HAVE SAID

412
00:18:41,121 --> 00:18:43,187
       THAT SHE CAN PROVE
           IS UNTRUE.

413
00:18:46,892 --> 00:18:51,028
 - WAIT A MINUTE, WHY IS THERE
     A WOMAN UNDER MY DESK?

414
00:18:51,030 --> 00:18:53,231
     - OH, IS THERE, PIERS?

415
00:18:53,233 --> 00:18:55,867
         YES, MY FATHER
   DEFRAUDED A LOT OF PEOPLE,

416
00:18:55,869 --> 00:18:57,535
    AND HE'S PAYING A PRICE
           FOR THAT,

417
00:18:57,537 --> 00:18:59,670
    BUT I'M NOT GONNA SIT BY
SILENTLY WHILE SHE EXPLOITS HIM

418
00:18:59,672 --> 00:19:01,372
  WITH LIES FOR HER OWN GAIN.

419
00:19:01,374 --> 00:19:03,374
     PIERS, THERE'S SO MUCH
        ABOUT MY FATHER

420
00:19:03,376 --> 00:19:05,443
      I WANT YOU TO KNOW,
           LIKE HE--

421
00:19:10,482 --> 00:19:12,583
        - WHAT IS THIS?

422
00:19:12,585 --> 00:19:15,019
  WELL...I KNOW WHAT THIS IS.

423
00:19:15,021 --> 00:19:16,854
         I'VE GOT ONE.

424
00:19:16,856 --> 00:19:19,190
        BUT WHOSE IS IT,
  AND WHY AM I LOOKING AT IT?

425
00:19:19,192 --> 00:19:21,592
      - IT'S MY FATHER'S.

426
00:19:21,594 --> 00:19:25,129
  HE HAD A BIT OF A TIP SLIP.

427
00:19:25,131 --> 00:19:27,665
   - MADAM, I DON'T KNOW WHAT
  YOU'RE LOOKING FOR IN A MAN,

428
00:19:27,667 --> 00:19:30,201
          BUT THIS...

429
00:19:30,203 --> 00:19:34,338
    IS FAR FROM INADEQUATE.

430
00:19:34,340 --> 00:19:36,874
      IN FACT, IT'S SO FAR
        FROM INADEQUATE,

431
00:19:36,876 --> 00:19:39,076
THAT I'M BRINGING THIS INTERVIEW
     TO AN IMMEDIATE CLOSE.

432
00:19:39,078 --> 00:19:42,213
     YOUR BOOK AND YOU LACK
        ANY CREDIBILITY.

433
00:19:42,215 --> 00:19:45,416
           THAT'S IT.

434
00:19:47,886 --> 00:19:52,323
    "CAN YOU HOOK ME UP WITH
A DISCOUNT AT PIERS 1 IMPORTS?"

435
00:19:56,828 --> 00:19:58,262
        - HEY, YOU KNOW,
  THEY'LL PROBABLY COME TO YOU

436
00:19:58,264 --> 00:19:59,997
        ONE DAY AND WANT
        A TELL-ALL BOOK.

437
00:19:59,999 --> 00:20:03,601
   REMEMBER, WE ALREADY HAVE
  CHAPTER ONE, "SLEEP FARTS."

438
00:20:03,603 --> 00:20:07,138
          CHAPTER TWO:
     "MY NEW STEPMOM MAX."

439
00:20:09,174 --> 00:20:12,210
- MAX, AM I GONNA HAVE TO DEFEND
       MY FATHER FOREVER?

440
00:20:12,212 --> 00:20:15,046
  - PROBABLY, BUT DON'T WORRY,
     I'LL BE THERE TO HELP.

441
00:20:15,048 --> 00:20:16,214
          - THANK YOU.

442
00:20:16,216 --> 00:20:17,215
   - 'CAUSE IT'S A WIFE'S JOB

443
00:20:17,217 --> 00:20:19,717
     TO DEFEND HER HUSBAND.

444
00:20:19,719 --> 00:20:22,720
   - IT MAKES ME SAD TO THINK
    HE'S GONNA BE IN PRISON

445
00:20:22,722 --> 00:20:24,555
   FOR THE REST OF HIS LIFE.

446
00:20:24,557 --> 00:20:27,191
 - DON'T THINK OF IT LIKE THAT.
    HE'S NOT JUST IN PRISON.

447
00:20:27,193 --> 00:20:29,594
         HE'S IN AFRICA
      WORKING WITH UNICEF,

448
00:20:29,596 --> 00:20:33,130
HE'S IN HAITI, HE'S WATER-SKIING
     ON "LAKE RICH PERSON,"

449
00:20:33,132 --> 00:20:37,969
    AND HE'S ON THE DESKTOP
        OF MY COMPUTER.

450
00:20:37,971 --> 00:20:40,004
    - I SHOULD DELETE THAT.

451
00:20:40,006 --> 00:20:45,076
   WHERE'D I LEAVE MY PHONE?

452
00:20:45,078 --> 00:20:47,411
 OH, GOD, ARE YOU GUYS LOOKING
   AT THE PICTURE OF MY DAD?

453
00:20:47,413 --> 00:20:51,048
       - WE ARE. RESPECT.

454
00:20:51,050 --> 00:20:54,285
    - SO VERY MUCH RESPECT.

455
00:20:54,287 --> 00:20:57,655
    - EH, I'VE SEEN BETTER.

456
00:20:57,657 --> 00:21:01,292
           EVERY DAY.

457
00:21:02,694 --> 00:21:03,961
        - GIVE ME THAT.

458
00:21:03,963 --> 00:21:06,030
              OH!
