00:00:03,063 --> 00:00:06,063
不久前 在美国加州帕萨迪纳市的一间公寓里...

00:00:15,263 --> 00:00:21,763
第194集 激动人心的首映式

4
00:00:22,864 --> 00:00:24,863
在这紧张的时刻

5
00:00:24,864 --> 00:00:27,263
我们的英雄 Leonard Sheldon Wolowitz和koothrappali知道

6
00:00:27,264 --> 00:00:30,763
"新星球大战"电影首映式的票马上就要开始预售了

7
00:00:33,463 --> 00:00:37,263
如果他们任务失败 没能抢到首映式的票的话

8
00:00:37,264 --> 00:00:42,263
Sheldon发誓他们将永生不得安宁...

9
00:00:43,363 --> 00:00:46,763
其他人相信他

10
00:00:58,663 --> 00:01:00,763
- 嘿 已经开始卖票了!  - 什么?!
- Guys, tickets already went on sale!  - What?!

11
00:01:00,765 --> 00:01:02,565
应该还没开始的啊
They're not supposed to be available yet.

12
00:01:02,567 --> 00:01:04,233
我也不知道这是什么情况 但是真的已经开始卖了!
I don't know what to tell you, but they're on sale!

13
00:01:04,235 --> 00:01:06,702
什么? 等下 你确定这是星球大战的票吗?
What? Wait. You're sure they're Star Wars tickets?

14
00:01:06,704 --> 00:01:10,873
不是 这是"钢木兰花2: 更加坚强"的票("钢木兰花"是1989年美国电影)
No, it's Steel Magnolias 2: Even Steelier.

15
00:01:12,076 --> 00:01:13,409
网站被挤爆了 我登不上去!
The web site's frozen. I can't get in!

16
00:01:13,411 --> 00:01:14,844
- 是啊 我也是  - 我也一样!
- Yeah, me, too.  - Same here!

17
00:01:14,846 --> 00:01:17,112
怎么办啊 要卖完了! 我们怎么办啊?!
Guys, they're gonna sell out! What are we gonna do?!

18
00:01:17,114 --> 00:01:19,348
好吧 我下面要做的事与我一直所坚持的立场都不相符
All right, this goes against everything I stand for,

19
00:01:19,350 --> 00:01:21,684
但我们现在也算是走投无路了
but desperate times call for desperate measures.

20
00:01:21,686 --> 00:01:23,385
主啊...
Lord...

21
00:01:25,189 --> 00:01:27,189
我是Sheldon Cooper
This is Sheldon Cooper.

22
00:01:27,191 --> 00:01:29,859
你是我母亲的好朋友
You're good friends with my mom.

23
00:01:29,861 --> 00:01:33,495
我知道我这辈子都在致力于否认你的存在
I know I've spent my life denying that you exist.

24
00:01:33,497 --> 00:01:35,898
- 抢到了!  - 我会继续否认的!
- Got'em!  - And I will continue to do so!

25
00:01:37,301 --> 00:01:40,903
* 宇宙一度又烫又稠密 *
* Our whole universe was in a hot, dense state *

26
00:01:40,905 --> 00:01:44,240
* 140亿年前终于爆了炸... 等着瞧! *
* Then nearly 14 billion years ago expansion started... Wait! *

27
00:01:44,242 --> 00:01:45,875
* 地球开始降温 *

* We built the Wall We built the pyramids *

30
00:01:51,082 --> 00:01:53,749
* 数学 自然科学 历史 揭开神秘 *
* Math, Science, History, unraveling the mystery *

31
00:01:53,751 --> 00:01:55,618
* 一切由大爆炸开始 *

我真的很高兴你和Amy复合了
I'm really happy you and Amy are back together.

37
00:02:08,653 --> 00:02:10,186
谢啦
Oh, thank you.

38
00:02:10,188 --> 00:02:12,555
我也很高兴 不过我实在没法假装我是为你感到高兴
I'm also really happy, but I can't pretend it's for you.

39
00:02:12,557 --> 00:02:14,657
离新的"星球大战"还有三天!
New Star Wars in three days!

40
00:02:15,627 --> 00:02:17,627
再着急你也得等到周四
Hey, Thursday can't get here soon enough.

41
00:02:17,629 --> 00:02:20,130
我要休几天假 一边吃完能撑死伍基人的"星球大战"麦片
I'm taking off work to watch the original trilogy

42
00:02:20,132 --> 00:02:24,601
一边重温以前的星球大战原版三部曲
while I eat enough Star Wars cereal to choke a Wookiee.

43
00:02:24,603 --> 00:02:28,104
呃 亲爱的 你应该知道周四是Amy的生日吧
Uh, sweetie, you do realize Thursday is Amy's birthday.

44
00:02:28,106 --> 00:02:30,673
你也应该知道 我是在我们分手的那段时间里
And you do realize I bought my ticket

45
00:02:30,675 --> 00:02:32,475
买的电影票吧?
when Amy and I were broken up?

46
00:02:33,945 --> 00:02:36,112
希望你别再提这件事了
I hope you didn't need anything in that case,

47
00:02:36,114 --> 00:02:37,547
因为我不会听的
because it's closed.

48
00:02:37,549 --> 00:02:39,916
你们才刚刚和好
You guys just got back together.

49
00:02:39,918 --> 00:02:42,085
你最好别连生日都不陪她过
You might not want to ditch her on her birthday.

50
00:02:42,087 --> 00:02:44,354
我觉得Penny说的没错 你可以换一天去看电影
I think Penny has a point. You can see it another day.

51
00:02:44,356 --> 00:02:46,356
可是我会被剧透电影的内容
But someone might spoil the movie.

52
00:02:46,358 --> 00:02:48,424
但是对我来说Amy身上没什么可剧透的了
No one can spoil Amy's birthday for me.

53
00:02:48,426 --> 00:02:49,726
天啊! 她又变老了一岁
Surprise! She's even older.

54
00:02:49,728 --> 00:02:52,028
谁能猜得到?
Who saw that coming?

55
00:02:52,030 --> 00:02:53,830
真是精辟
Oh, that's nice.

56
00:02:53,832 --> 00:02:56,299
把这句话写在她的蛋糕上吧
Put that on her cake.

57
00:03:05,977 --> 00:03:08,912
好吧 又是这套
Oh, great. This again.

58
00:03:08,914 --> 00:03:12,649
Arthur 你怎么回来了?
Arthur, what brings you back?

59
00:03:12,651 --> 00:03:14,884
呃 我也不知道 我... 我就是...
Uh, beats me. I... I just...

60
00:03:14,886 --> 00:03:17,487
希望这不是个... 春梦就好
hope this isn't a... a sex dream.

61
00:03:19,324 --> 00:03:21,257
以前 在我纠结的时候
In the past, you've come to me

62
00:03:21,259 --> 00:03:23,092
你曾经来到过我身边
when I'm struggling with a dilemma.

63
00:03:23,094 --> 00:03:26,262
还有... 一次... 你感到害怕的时候
And... and the one time where... where you were afraid,

64
00:03:26,264 --> 00:03:30,567
我来当你的... 小夜灯
and you needed me for... for a night light.

65
00:03:32,204 --> 00:03:34,070
这次... 有什么想不明白的?
What's... what's troubling you?

66
00:03:34,940 --> 00:03:36,639
呃...
Well...

67
00:03:36,641 --> 00:03:38,608
我的朋友跟我说
my friends are telling me

68
00:03:38,610 --> 00:03:41,044
我应该陪我女朋友过生日
I shouldn't abandon my girlfriend on her birthday

69
00:03:41,046 --> 00:03:43,846
而不应该自己去看"星球大战"的电影
to see the new Star Wars movie.

70
00:03:43,848 --> 00:03:46,249
听起来没错啊
Well, sounds right.

71
00:03:47,619 --> 00:03:50,086
我... 我能不穿这件...
Can... can I get out of this...

72
00:03:50,088 --> 00:03:52,989
Muumuu了嘛? (夏威夷女性传统服装印花长袍)
Muumuu now?

73
00:03:52,991 --> 00:03:55,058
这是绝地长袍啊
Those are the robes of the Jedi,

74
00:03:55,060 --> 00:03:57,994
是银河系中和平与正义的维护者
the guardians of peace and justice in the galaxy.

75
00:03:57,996 --> 00:04:02,198
而且... 他们... 他们还不穿内衣
And they... they... they don't wear underwear.

76
00:04:07,138 --> 00:04:09,372
所以 你同意我朋友们
So, you agree with my friends

77
00:04:09,374 --> 00:04:11,574
让我不去看首映的观点吗?
that I should skip the premiere?

78
00:04:11,576 --> 00:04:15,211
嗯... 你... 你爱这个女孩吗?
Uh, do... do you love this girl?

79
00:04:15,213 --> 00:04:17,146
爱
Yes.

80
00:04:17,148 --> 00:04:20,416
但她知道星球大战对我来说有多重要
But she knows how important Star Wars is to me.

81
00:04:20,418 --> 00:04:22,719
你应该让她知道...
Well, maybe you should show her how...

82
00:04:22,721 --> 00:04:25,555
她对你有多重要
how important she is to you.

83
00:04:25,557 --> 00:04:29,325
去看她想让我看的电影吗?
By seeing the movie she'd want me to see?

84
00:04:30,495 --> 00:04:33,730
Sheldon 这电影你随时都能看
Sheldon, you can see this movie whenever you want.

85
00:04:34,633 --> 00:04:37,934
但你能和这个女人在一起的时间
But you only have a limited number of days

86
00:04:37,936 --> 00:04:41,070
却是有限的
that you-you can be with this woman.

87
00:04:41,072 --> 00:04:42,905
和她在一起
Be with her.

88
00:04:44,743 --> 00:04:46,676
没错
You're right.

89
00:04:46,678 --> 00:04:48,344
好
Great.

90
00:04:49,214 --> 00:04:51,180
你要去哪?
Where are you going?

91
00:04:51,182 --> 00:04:56,085
我不知道 但希望是能穿内裤的地方
I don't know, but hopefully, somewhere I can wear pants.

92
00:05:05,330 --> 00:05:07,330
Sheldon 怎么了?
Sheldon, what's wrong?

93
00:05:07,332 --> 00:05:10,867
我想告诉你我准备和你一起过生日
I wanted to let you know I'll be spending your birthday with you.

94
00:05:11,736 --> 00:05:13,870
好啊
Okay.

95
00:05:13,872 --> 00:05:17,173
知道吗 我买了那天晚上星球大战的首映票
See, I... I had tickets to the Star Wars premiere that night,

96
00:05:17,175 --> 00:05:19,609
但质子教授打扮成欧比旺·肯诺比
but Professor Proton came to me in a dream dressed as

97
00:05:19,611 --> 00:05:22,712
进入我梦乡并说服我陪你
Obi-Wan Kenobi and convinced me I should be with you.

98
00:05:23,548 --> 00:05:25,448
欧比...啥?
Obi... what?

99
00:05:25,450 --> 00:05:28,384
你先去睡吧 晚安
I'll-I'll let you get back to sleep now. Good night.

100
00:05:28,386 --> 00:05:29,852
嗯 晚安 等等
Okay. Good night. Wait.

101
00:05:29,854 --> 00:05:31,287
嗯 Sheldon
Um, Sheldon,

102
00:05:31,289 --> 00:05:34,223
你原来不想和我一起过生日啊?
were you actually not gonna spend my birthday with me?

103
00:05:36,061 --> 00:05:38,828
太晚了 该挂了 晚安
It's late. Got to go. Bye.

104
00:05:39,998 --> 00:05:41,297
Sheldon选择和
Good for Sheldon deciding

105
00:05:41,299 --> 00:05:43,599
- Amy一起过生日很不错啊  - 当然
- to stay with Amy on her birthday.  - I know.

106
00:05:43,601 --> 00:05:45,568
如果不和他一起看电影还是很奇怪
It's still gonna be weird to see the movie without him.

107
00:05:45,570 --> 00:05:49,539
我们可以等几天一起去看
Well, we could wait a couple days and see it together.

108
00:05:52,510 --> 00:05:54,844
你们好
Hello.

109
00:05:54,846 --> 00:05:56,746
嘿 我们准备去漫画店了 你要一起来吗?
Hey. We're going to the comic book store. You want to come?

110
00:05:56,748 --> 00:05:58,181
不 我不行
No, I can't.

111
00:05:58,183 --> 00:06:00,316
我得为Amy的生日做准备
I need to make preparations for Amy's birthday.

112
00:06:00,318 --> 00:06:01,451
所以我需要
Which leads me

113
00:06:01,453 --> 00:06:03,586
做这件事
to the following bit of business.

114
00:06:03,588 --> 00:06:05,822
这是我的星球大战电影票
This is my ticket to Star Wars.

115
00:06:05,824 --> 00:06:08,358
我不需要告诉你它的实际价值
I don't have to tell you it is worth far more

116
00:06:08,360 --> 00:06:11,994
要远高于他15.5刀的票面价值
than its face value of $15.50.

117
00:06:11,996 --> 00:06:14,731
我希望你能把它送给对的人
I trust you'll give it to someone worthy.

118
00:06:14,733 --> 00:06:16,032
没问题
You got it.

119
00:06:16,034 --> 00:06:17,633
Penny可能和我们一起看
Well, Penny might want to join us.

120
00:06:17,635 --> 00:06:21,070
这是我去看星球大战的电影票
This is my ticket to Star Wars.

121
00:06:22,140 --> 00:06:23,439
Penny啊
Penny.

122
00:06:23,441 --> 00:06:24,607
Penny啊?
Penny?

123
00:06:24,609 --> 00:06:25,742
Penny啊?
Penny?

124
00:06:25,744 --> 00:06:28,111
如果我说"请进"会怎么样?
What happens if I say, "Come in"?

125
00:06:28,113 --> 00:06:29,779
试试看吧
Well, find out.

126
00:06:29,781 --> 00:06:31,114
请进!
Come in!

127
00:06:34,419 --> 00:06:36,386
Bernadette啊?
Bernadette?

128
00:06:36,388 --> 00:06:38,388
Bernadette啊? Bernadette啊?
Bernadette? Bernadette?

129
00:06:38,390 --> 00:06:40,656
请进!
Come in!

130
00:06:40,658 --> 00:06:42,692
继续吧
Keep it up.

131
00:06:42,694 --> 00:06:44,727
反正我也没地方去
I got nowhere else to be.

132
00:06:44,729 --> 00:06:46,696
就直接进来吧
Just come in.

133
00:06:47,832 --> 00:06:50,433
提醒一下 如果我想看贱女孩了
For future reference, if I want to watch Mean Girls,

134
00:06:50,435 --> 00:06:52,902
我可以在Netflix在线看的
I'll stream it on Netflix.

135
00:06:52,904 --> 00:06:55,037
不好意思 有事吗?
We're sorry. What do you need?

136
00:06:55,039 --> 00:06:56,406
你们也知道
Well, as you know,

137
00:06:56,408 --> 00:06:58,408
我将会和Amy一起庆祝她生日
I'll be celebrating Amy's birthday with her,

138
00:06:58,410 --> 00:06:59,642
我想让你们帮我选一个
and I could use your assistance

139
00:06:59,644 --> 00:07:01,511
最合适的生日礼物给她
in helping me select the perfect gift.

140
00:07:01,513 --> 00:07:03,045
到目前为止
Sure. Well, so far,

141
00:07:03,047 --> 00:07:04,480
我总共想出了三个点子
I've come up with three ideas.

142
00:07:04,482 --> 00:07:06,082
第一是给她一个
The first is a chance for her

143
00:07:06,084 --> 00:07:07,917
和洛杉矶爱乐乐团一起演奏竖琴的机会
to play the harp with the L.A. Philharmonic.

144
00:07:07,919 --> 00:07:09,652
哇 这你都能安排?
Wow. You can really arrange that?

145
00:07:09,654 --> 00:07:11,187
我说的是 一个机会 你懂得
Well, I said a chance, you know.

146
00:07:11,189 --> 00:07:12,622
当你在本尼根餐厅
When you tell them it's your birthday

147
00:07:12,624 --> 00:07:14,023
告诉他们今天是你生日的时候 他们对你简直关爱有加
at Bennigan's, they make a fuss.

148
00:07:14,025 --> 00:07:16,292
我不觉得爱乐乐团会有什么不同
I don't see why the Philharmonic would be any different.

149
00:07:17,195 --> 00:07:19,562
来点更实际点的怎么样?
How about something a little more realistic?

150
00:07:19,564 --> 00:07:22,165
Amy喜欢自己织毛衣
Well, Amy enjoys knitting her own sweaters,

151
00:07:22,167 --> 00:07:24,967
所以我想把费用全包 让她去
so I was thinking of getting her an all-expense-paid trip

152
00:07:24,969 --> 00:07:27,804
参加威斯康辛的绵羊和羊毛节
to the Wisconsin Sheep and Wool Festival.

153
00:07:30,542 --> 00:07:33,576
不好意思 我正等着你说逗你玩呢
Sorry. I was waiting for the bazinga.

154
00:07:34,279 --> 00:07:35,778
等等 可能会很浪漫呀
Hold on. It could be romantic.

155
00:07:35,780 --> 00:07:37,213
两个人远在天边
The two of them away together,

156
00:07:37,215 --> 00:07:40,082
在飘雪的威斯康辛相拥取暖
keeping each other warm in snowy Wisconsin.

157
00:07:40,084 --> 00:07:41,617
不不不 她会一个人去
No, no, no, no. She'd be going alone.

158
00:07:41,619 --> 00:07:43,286
如果你觉得我很怕鸟的话
Well, if you think I'm afraid of birds,

159
00:07:43,288 --> 00:07:44,587
你最好看看我在一群羊旁边是什么样子
you should see me around sheep.

160
00:07:44,589 --> 00:07:46,823
好吧 选择三是什么?
Okay, well, what's the third option?

161
00:07:46,825 --> 00:07:48,291
我和她上床
That I have coitus with her.

162
00:07:56,701 --> 00:07:59,602
你觉得把Sheldon的票给Stuart怎么样?
What do you think about giving Sheldon's ticket to Stuart?

163
00:07:59,604 --> 00:08:01,137
不知道
I don't know.

164
00:08:01,139 --> 00:08:03,606
你之前和Stuart一起看过电影吗?
Have you ever seen a movie with Stuart before?

165
00:08:03,608 --> 00:08:06,142
感觉就像和爷爷一起去看电影
It's like going with your grandpa.

166
00:08:06,144 --> 00:08:07,543
他不吃爆米花
Instead of eating popcorn,

167
00:08:07,545 --> 00:08:09,779
自己带了塑料盒装的鸡肉丁
he brings little pieces of chicken in Tupperware

168
00:08:09,781 --> 00:08:12,181
和一保温瓶的热汤
and a thermos full of soup.

169
00:08:12,183 --> 00:08:14,217
他没那么糟啦
He's not that bad.

170
00:08:14,219 --> 00:08:17,286
嘿 Stuart 你周四晚上有安排吗?
Hey, Stuart, got any plans Thursday night?

171
00:08:17,288 --> 00:08:19,989
呃... 我的医生很担心我的血液循环
My, uh... my doctor's worried about my circulation,

172
00:08:19,991 --> 00:08:22,859
所以我打算在商场周围走一走
so I was thinking about walking around the mall.

173
00:08:22,861 --> 00:08:24,494
为什么?
Why?

174
00:08:24,496 --> 00:08:26,662
嘿 小伙伴们
Well... Hey, you guys.

175
00:08:26,664 --> 00:08:28,297
记得穿双舒服的鞋
Oh, make sure to wear sensible shoes.

176
00:08:28,299 --> 00:08:30,533
Wil 周四想去看星战吗?
Wil, want to go to Star Wars Thursday?

177
00:08:30,535 --> 00:08:31,667
当然
Absolutely.

178
00:08:31,669 --> 00:08:33,236
好的 带上Wil
Fine, take Wil.

179
00:08:33,238 --> 00:08:35,505
看他会不会给你们带奶油蛤蜊汤
See if he brings you clam chowder.

180
00:08:37,675 --> 00:08:39,442
好 好 好 好 好
Okay, okay, okay, okay, okay.

181
00:08:39,444 --> 00:08:41,410
让我们... 让我们... 梳理一下目前的选择
Let's... let's... let's just recap our options.

182
00:08:41,412 --> 00:08:44,614
好吧 有弹竖琴 看绵羊...
All right, we've got harp thing, sheep thing...

183
00:08:44,616 --> 00:08:46,415
还有一夜狂欢
Wild thang.

184
00:08:49,153 --> 00:08:50,987
你们觉得她会喜欢哪一个?
Which do you think she'd prefer?

185
00:08:50,989 --> 00:08:54,757
我查了一下绵羊和羊毛节的网站
Because I checked the Sheep and Wool Festival Web site,

186
00:08:54,759 --> 00:08:57,226
现在只剩8000张票了
and there's only 8,000 tickets left.

187
00:08:59,163 --> 00:09:02,064
Sheldon 和Amy亲近对你来说简直是巨人一跃啊
Sheldon, being physical with Amy is a huge step for you.

188
00:09:02,066 --> 00:09:03,866
你准备好了吗?
Yeah, are you ready for this?

189
00:09:03,868 --> 00:09:07,136
任何形式的亲密对我来说都是挑战
Intimacy in any form has been challenging for me,

190
00:09:07,138 --> 00:09:09,772
但是我想告诉她她对我有多重要
but I'd like to show her how important she is,

191
00:09:09,774 --> 00:09:12,642
感觉现在好像是正确的时机
and it feels like now might be the right time.

192
00:09:12,644 --> 00:09:14,410
sheldon 你这么说好甜蜜
Sheldon, that's so beautiful.

193
00:09:14,412 --> 00:09:16,245
那就这么定了
Then it's settled.

194
00:09:16,247 --> 00:09:18,915
Amy的生日礼物将会是我的小丁丁
Amy's birthday present will be my genitals.

195
00:09:28,543 --> 00:09:29,942
谢谢你们带我出来玩
Thanks for taking me out.

196
00:09:29,944 --> 00:09:32,011
你生日要和Sheldon一起过嘛
Well, you're spending your birthday with Sheldon.

197
00:09:32,013 --> 00:09:33,145
那我们就提前庆祝咯?
Why not celebrate early?

198
00:09:33,147 --> 00:09:34,947
你想去哪?
So where do you want to go?

199
00:09:34,949 --> 00:09:37,483
听说绿街上新开的墨西哥餐厅不错
I heard that new Mexican place on Green Street is good.

200
00:09:37,485 --> 00:09:41,821
可以 或者我们带你去做个比基尼蜜蜡脱毛怎么样
Sure, sure. Or we could take you to get a bikini wax.

201
00:09:43,424 --> 00:09:46,893
我为什么要在生日做比基尼蜜蜡脱毛?
Why would I get a bikini wax for my birthday?

202
00:09:46,895 --> 00:09:49,662
呃 不知道 就是想到了
Uh, I don't know. It was just a thought.

203
00:09:49,664 --> 00:09:51,731
我还是选墨西哥餐厅吧
I think I'll just stick to Mexican.

204
00:09:51,733 --> 00:09:55,902
不错啊 也许在那之后 我们还能看个小黄片什么的
Great. And then maybe after, we can watch a dirty movie,

205
00:09:55,904 --> 00:09:58,738
而且如果那谁有技术细节要咨询的话
and if anybody has any questions about what happened or how,

206
00:09:58,740 --> 00:10:01,073
我们还能顺便解答一下
we can answer them.

207
00:10:01,976 --> 00:10:04,277
好了 到底发生什么了?
Okay, what is going on?

208
00:10:04,279 --> 00:10:06,312
呃 我们只想让你为明天可能的惊喜
Oh, we just want you to be prepared

209
00:10:06,314 --> 00:10:08,648
提前有个心理准备
for any surprises that might happen tomorrow.

210
00:10:08,650 --> 00:10:10,783
什么惊喜?
What surprises?

211
00:10:10,785 --> 00:10:12,718
噢
Oh.

212
00:10:12,720 --> 00:10:14,987
我们不想提前剧透什么
We don't want to spoil anything,

213
00:10:14,989 --> 00:10:19,926
但是你看 Sheldon说他准备好啪啪啪了
but you should know that Sheldon said he's ready to be physical.

214
00:10:19,928 --> 00:10:22,428
你胡扯呢吧!
You shut your damn mouth!

215
00:10:26,067 --> 00:10:28,801
你们真听见他这么说了?
You actually heard him say this?

216
00:10:28,803 --> 00:10:30,102
是的 他说他想做点什么
Yes. He said he wants to do something

217
00:10:30,104 --> 00:10:31,537
来让你知道你对他有多重要
to show you how much you mean to him.

218
00:10:31,539 --> 00:10:36,108
我... 难以置信 我...
I... I can't believe it. I...

219
00:10:37,512 --> 00:10:39,812
我不知道该说什么了
I don't know what to say.

220
00:10:39,814 --> 00:10:41,681
我们真的为你高兴
Well, we're really happy for you,

221
00:10:41,683 --> 00:10:43,382
我们知道他有多么在乎...
and we know how much he cares...

222
00:10:43,384 --> 00:10:45,151
我知道该怎么办了! 去刮蜡吧!
I do know what to say! Let's get me waxed!

223
00:10:54,595 --> 00:10:58,864
这儿怎么不是安吉·迪金森的卧室?
Why isn't it ever Angie Dickinson's bedroom?

224
00:10:54,595 --> 00:10:58,864
{\an8}安吉·迪金森是肯尼迪的情人之一

225
00:10:59,934 --> 00:11:01,600
你回来了
You're back.

226
00:11:01,602 --> 00:11:05,805
似乎... 似乎这个不取决于我
It... it doesn't seem like it's up to me.

227
00:11:05,807 --> 00:11:08,374
我想你在这儿是因为...
I suppose you're here because...

228
00:11:08,376 --> 00:11:11,610
我决定跟我女朋友身体接触了
I've decided to be physical with my girlfriend,

229
00:11:11,612 --> 00:11:14,280
而以前从没这么干过
and I've never done that before.

230
00:11:14,282 --> 00:11:18,417
等... 等一会儿
E... Excuse me for a moment.

231
00:11:34,035 --> 00:11:36,869
反正试试也无妨
Well, it was worth a shot.

232
00:11:38,706 --> 00:11:41,674
所以 你能帮帮我吗?
So, can you help me?

233
00:11:41,676 --> 00:11:44,210
呃 好的 嗯...
Uh, all right. Um...

234
00:11:44,212 --> 00:11:47,680
一旦... 一旦男的褪掉了
once... once the man gets

235
00:11:47,682 --> 00:11:50,649
女人的...女人的小内内...
the... the woman out of her... out of her bloomers...

236
00:11:50,651 --> 00:11:53,652
噢 不是那样的
Oh, no. Not that.

237
00:11:53,654 --> 00:11:56,155
我... 我知道是怎么操作的
I... I understand the mechanics.

238
00:11:56,157 --> 00:11:58,457
噢 好吧 好吧 因为 呃
Oh, good, good. 'Cause, uh,

239
00:11:58,459 --> 00:12:02,261
我不知道现在的年轻人...
I have no idea what kids these days are...

240
00:12:02,263 --> 00:12:05,698
是怎么叫...叫他们的那个的
calling their... their parts.

241
00:12:07,835 --> 00:12:10,503
我想他们称之为"木耳"
I think they say “junk.”

242
00:12:11,873 --> 00:12:14,707
这个世界究竟怎么了?
What is happening to this world?

243
00:12:15,943 --> 00:12:20,079
你究竟想知道什么?
What... what do you actually need to know?

244
00:12:21,516 --> 00:12:24,016
对我们来说 这是个重要的夜晚
This is an important night for us,

245
00:12:24,018 --> 00:12:26,785
我担心自己会发蒙
and I'm worried I might be overwhelmed

246
00:12:26,787 --> 00:12:29,121
然后把一切都搞砸
and ruin everything.

247
00:12:30,291 --> 00:12:33,893
Sheldon 如果...如果你是和对的人一起
Sheldon, if... if you're with the right person,

248
00:12:33,895 --> 00:12:36,529
那么... 不会有问题的
it... it'll be okay.

249
00:12:38,866 --> 00:12:41,133

Thank you, Arthur.

你是最有智慧的智者
You are the wisest of the wise.

251
00:12:44,305 --> 00:12:46,972
呃 你能这么说... 真是个好人
Well, that's... that's very nice of you to say,

252
00:12:46,974 --> 00:12:49,575
可是我觉得自己只是...
but I think I'm just an expression of...

253
00:12:49,577 --> 00:12:52,545
你潜意识里的人物
of your unconscious mind.

254
00:12:52,547 --> 00:12:55,114

263
00:13:15,382 --> 00:13:17,338
我们要比他爽多了
We're gonna have so much more fun than him.

264
00:13:20,041 --> 00:13:22,608
不 他们不会的
No, they're not.

265
00:13:22,610 --> 00:13:26,011
我了解他们 他们会的
Knowing them, they will.

266
00:13:30,218 --> 00:13:32,818
还差15分钟开始!
T minus 15 minutes!

00:13:32,820 --> 00:13:34,119
噢 你们知道Wil在哪吗?
Oh, did you hear from Wil?

268
00:13:34,121 --> 00:13:36,488
他在路上了 检查一下要不要上厕所
Yeah, he's on his way. Time for bladder check.

269
00:13:36,490 --> 00:13:37,890
不上

00:13:37,892 --> 00:13:39,158
不上
Check.

271
00:13:39,160 --> 00:13:41,727
不上 慢着
Check. Wait.

管它呢 我要憋着
Screw it. I'm holding it.

273
00:13:46,234 --> 00:13:48,000
大家都嘘什么呢?
What is everyone booing at?

274
00:13:54,609 --> 00:13:56,108

Star Trek stinks!

278
00:14:04,418 --> 00:14:07,686

我本来还给你买了个气球的
I also got you a balloon,

286
00:14:35,483 --> 00:14:38,183
可惜它飘走了 我还追了一会
but it floated away, and I chased it for a while.

287
00:14:38,185 --> 00:14:40,786
没事的 进来吧

Do you like it?

294
00:14:52,600 --> 00:14:54,833
有点诡异
It's kind of spooky.

295
00:14:54,835 --> 00:14:56,602
我可以恢复原样的
I can change it back.

296
00:14:56,604 --> 00:14:58,137
没事没事 你过生日嘛
No, no, no. It's your birthday.

297
00:14:58,139 --> 00:15:01,840
只要没有戴着面具的怪人跳出来就没事
As long as no one jumps out in a hockey mask, I'll be fine.

298
00:15:05,513 --> 00:15:07,980

300
00:15:11,719 --> 00:15:14,420
我想带你去吃一顿生日大餐
I thought I could take you out to a nice birthday dinner.

301
00:15:14,422 --> 00:15:18,824
如果我们往东边走的话 说不定还能找到气球呢
If we pick a place east of here, we might find the balloon.

302
00:15:18,826 --> 00:15:21,860
嗯 听起来不错 不过...
Um, that sounds nice, but...

303
00:15:21,862 --> 00:15:24,830
我现在还不太饿
I'm not really hungry right now.

304
00:15:24,832 --> 00:15:27,466
我觉得...
I thought maybe...

305
00:15:27,468 --> 00:15:31,103
- 你可以先送我礼物  - 哦
- we could do presents first.  - Oh.

306
00:15:31,972 --> 00:15:33,605
好吧
All right.

307
00:15:33,607 --> 00:15:35,708
呃...
Um...

308
00:15:35,710 --> 00:15:39,511
关于这个礼物 我有些话得告诉你
I should probably tell you something about this gift.

309
00:15:39,513 --> 00:15:43,515
你是说 在你...
You mean before you...

310
00:15:43,517 --> 00:15:46,719
把它给我之前?
give it to me?

311
00:15:48,789 --> 00:15:51,090
是的
Yes.

312
00:15:51,092 --> 00:15:54,960
在我把它给你之前...
May I ask you a question before I...

313
00:15:54,962 --> 00:15:57,796
我能先问你个问题吗?
give it to you?

314
00:15:57,798 --> 00:16:00,566
- 当然  - 我们为什么一直强调
- Of course.  - Why are we saying

315
00:16:00,568 --> 00:16:03,202
"把它给你"?
"give it to you" like that?

316
00:16:03,204 --> 00:16:05,904
呃 Sheldon
Sheldon,

317
00:16:05,906 --> 00:16:09,241
我知道你的礼物是...
I know your present is...

318
00:16:09,243 --> 00:16:13,178
今晚我们亲密一下
for us to be intimate tonight.

319
00:16:13,180 --> 00:16:15,581
我知道了
I see.

320
00:16:15,583 --> 00:16:17,316
这样可以吗?
Is that all right?

321
00:16:22,823 --> 00:16:25,190
抱歉 不过现在人们都超爱打官司
I'm sorry, but this is a litigious society.

322
00:16:25,192 --> 00:16:27,726
我还是需要你明确的口头同意
I'm gonna need verbal consent.

323
00:16:29,530 --> 00:16:31,730
当然可以
Yes.

324
00:16:33,067 --> 00:16:36,268
等一下 我上网找找有没有相关的合同可以签
You know what, let me pull a quick contract off the Internet.

325
00:16:41,242 --> 00:16:44,576
好吧 要是你不喜欢"星球大战"的话 你为什么来这里?
So, if you don't like Star Wars, why are you here?

326
00:16:44,578 --> 00:16:45,711
哦 我就是来看着玩玩
Oh, I'm just having fun.

327
00:16:45,713 --> 00:16:47,546
所有人都把星球大战看的太认真了
Everyone takes Star Wars so seriously.

328
00:16:47,548 --> 00:16:50,416
就好像这要是个烂片的话 他们这辈子都毁了似的
Like if the movie's bad, it's gonna ruin their lives.

329
00:16:50,418 --> 00:16:52,151
是个烂片? 你听说了什么吗?
Is it bad? Did you hear something?

330
00:16:52,153 --> 00:16:55,521
天啊 这电影不好看 你们谁杀了我吧
Oh, my God. It's bad. Somebody kill me.

331
00:16:55,523 --> 00:16:58,090
看到了吧? 我就是这个意思
See? That's what I mean.

332
00:16:58,092 --> 00:16:59,992
当你明早起来时 不管这是
When you wake up in the morning, whether this is

333
00:16:59,994 --> 00:17:02,127
一部史上最好的电影还是超级烂片
the greatest movie ever or a total piece of crap,

334
00:17:02,129 --> 00:17:03,729
你的生活完全不会因此改变
your life isn't gonna change at all.

335
00:17:04,598 --> 00:17:06,632
他说得对
He's right.

336
00:17:06,634 --> 00:17:07,833
是啊
Yeah.

337
00:17:07,835 --> 00:17:09,401
不管发生什么
No matter what happens,

338
00:17:09,403 --> 00:17:11,537
明天我们都会再回来看一遍
we're coming back tomorrow to watch it again.

339
00:17:14,074 --> 00:17:16,442
你觉得Sheldon真的可以完成这件事吗?
Do you think Sheldon's actually gonna go through with it?

340
00:17:16,444 --> 00:17:17,643
我不知道
I don't know.

341
00:17:17,645 --> 00:17:20,045
- 他说他准备好了  - 是啊 但他还宣誓
- He said he's ready.  - Yeah, but he also swore

342
00:17:20,047 --> 00:17:22,614
今年可以把南瓜的内瓤
this was the year he'd be able to pull the guts out

343
00:17:22,616 --> 00:17:24,683
挖出来
of a pumpkin.

344
00:17:24,685 --> 00:17:26,752
我觉得有戏 我们聊过
Well, I'm gonna stay positive. I mean, we talked.

345
00:17:26,754 --> 00:17:29,221
我告诉他女人喜欢什么 他咯咯笑过后
I told him what women like, and after he stopped giggling,

346
00:17:29,223 --> 00:17:31,623
神情还是很镇定的
he seemed pretty sure of himself.

347
00:17:44,505 --> 00:17:45,904
嗨
Hi.

348
00:17:45,906 --> 00:17:48,106
你好
Hello.

349
00:17:49,410 --> 00:17:52,478
所以...
So, um...

350
00:17:52,480 --> 00:17:55,414
我应该钻到被子下面和你一起吗?
should I get under the covers with you?

351
00:17:56,250 --> 00:17:58,517
好的
All right.

352
00:18:18,639 --> 00:18:20,873
- 你好  - 嗨!
- Hello.  - Hi!

353
00:18:23,677 --> 00:18:26,645
你为什么在颤抖? 你冷吗?
Why are you shaking? Are you cold?

354
00:18:26,647 --> 00:18:30,115
我只是... 真的很紧张
I'm just, um... really nervous.

355
00:18:30,117 --> 00:18:31,583
紧张什么?
Why?

356
00:18:31,585 --> 00:18:34,219
呃...
Well...

357
00:18:34,221 --> 00:18:36,655
我等这天等了好久
I've been waiting for this for so long,

358
00:18:36,657 --> 00:18:40,325
我只是... 在脑海中幻想了很久
I've just... built it up in my head.

359
00:18:40,327 --> 00:18:43,228
我不知道会发生什么
I don't know what to expect.

360
00:18:43,230 --> 00:18:46,265
我也是
Neither do I.

361
00:18:46,267 --> 00:18:50,903
但是... 我们可以一起来发现
But... we can find out together.

362
00:18:52,706 --> 00:18:54,907
好的
Okay.

363
00:19:01,649 --> 00:19:04,816
我真的好紧张
I'm really nervous.

364
00:19:05,686 --> 00:19:07,085
我知道
I know.

365
00:19:07,087 --> 00:19:10,289
我们等这天等了好久
We've been waiting so long for this.

366
00:19:10,291 --> 00:19:14,459
我们在脑海中想了好久
And we've built it up in our heads so much.

367
00:19:14,461 --> 00:19:17,396
各位 这只是一部电影
Guys, it's just a movie.

368
00:19:17,398 --> 00:19:18,897
是啊
That's true.

369
00:19:18,899 --> 00:19:20,566
他说得对 这只是一部电影
He's right. It is.

370
00:19:20,568 --> 00:19:24,703
不过 还记得加·加吗
Although, we all remember Jar Jar.

371
00:19:24,705 --> 00:19:28,307
Leonard 我...又害怕了
Leonard, I... I'm scared again.

372
00:19:33,847 --> 00:19:37,916
这比我想象的好多了
Well, I enjoyed that more than I thought I would.

373
00:19:44,725 --> 00:19:47,993
我也是
Me, too.

374
00:19:47,995 --> 00:19:53,198
我期待等你下次生日时我们再来一次
I look forward to your next birthday when we do it again.

375
00:19:54,635 --> 00:19:56,902
我同意
That works for me.

376
00:19:56,904 --> 00:20:00,539
这比我想象的好多了
I enjoyed that more than I thought I would.

377
00:20:03,344 --> 00:20:07,546
我觉得我现在走不了路了
I don't think I can walk right now.

378
00:20:15,634 --> 00:20:18,302
呃 Sheldon?
Uh, Sheldon?

379
00:20:18,304 --> 00:20:20,337
Sheldon啊
Sheldon.

380
00:20:20,339 --> 00:20:21,605
诶 Arthur
Arthur.

381
00:20:21,607 --> 00:20:22,973
你在这干什么?
What are you doing here?

382
00:20:22,975 --> 00:20:24,007
我... 我觉得
I... I don't think

383
00:20:24,009 --> 00:20:26,643
我不需要什么建议了
I need any more advice.

384
00:20:26,645 --> 00:20:29,246
我...我只是很好奇
I... I was just curious.

385
00:20:30,416 --> 00:20:33,884
怎...怎么样?
How... How'd it go?

386
00:20:33,886 --> 00:20:35,652
哦
Oh.

387
00:20:38,324 --> 00:20:39,990
非常赞
It was amazing.

388
00:20:40,759 --> 00:20:42,292
我... 我几天后去看了
I... I saw it a few days later.

389
00:20:42,294 --> 00:20:44,595
多么赞的电影
What a movie.

390
00:20:48,767 --> 00:20:51,668
但 呃... Amy怎么样?
But, uh, what... what about Amy?

391
00:20:51,670 --> 00:20:54,671
哦 呃 她觉得还好
Oh. Uh, uh, she liked it fine.

392
00:20:54,673 --> 00:20:59,176
但是她对这个系列没我这么有感情
But she doesn't have the history with the franchise I do.

393
00:21:00,012 --> 00:21:02,512
好吧 
Okay.

394
00:21:02,514 --> 00:21:05,082
交谈... 愉快
Good... good talk.
