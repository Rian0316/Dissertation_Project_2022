1
00:00:00,968 --> 00:00:03,836
孩子们 2012年的开始实在有些疯狂
Kids, 2012 started out kind of crazy.

2
00:00:04,523 --> 00:00:06,457
巴尼遇到一个叫奎恩的女孩
Barney met a girl named Quinn,

3
00:00:06,472 --> 00:00:08,455
凯文悔婚了
Kevin unproposed to Robin,

4
00:00:08,470 --> 00:00:09,736
我告诉罗宾
I told Robin...

5
00:00:09,747 --> 00:00:11,113
我爱你 罗宾
I love you, Robin.

6
00:00:11,124 --> 00:00:11,956
可是当我问她
When I asked if she

7
00:00:11,963 --> 00:00:13,880
是否一样爱我的时候 她说
loved me back, she said...

8
00:00:13,895 --> 00:00:15,611
不
No.

9
00:00:15,624 --> 00:00:16,773
马修告诉罗宾
Marshall told Robin...

10
00:00:16,783 --> 00:00:18,750
你得搬出去了
You got to move out.

11
00:00:18,765 --> 00:00:21,883
罗宾就搬走了
And Robin did.

12
00:00:29,059 --> 00:00:31,944
我再也不去她的卧室了 好桑心啊
I can't even open her bedroom door anymore.

13
00:00:32,703 --> 00:00:34,671
我为啥这么多愁善感啊
Why do I have to be so sensitive?

14
00:00:34,686 --> 00:00:36,969
我咋知道啊 哥们
I don't know, bro.

15
00:00:36,986 --> 00:00:38,202
你看看我 像被奎恩那小妞勾了魂一样
Look at me and that Quinn chick.

16
00:00:38,212 --> 00:00:39,495
你不会听到我碎碎念
You don't hear me prattling on

17
00:00:39,505 --> 00:00:41,722
说她的微笑多么摄人心魄
about how beautiful her smile is,

18
00:00:41,739 --> 00:00:45,774
说她的头发荡漾着蜜色光芒 如丝倾泻
how her hair is like a waterfall of honey-colored silk,

19
00:00:45,803 --> 00:00:49,221
说她的眼睛深邃如海
how her eyes are like a warm South Sea

20
00:00:49,245 --> 00:00:52,529
闪烁着落日般澄亮如金的神彩
kissed by the fire and gold of sunrise.

21
00:00:52,553 --> 00:00:54,553
我都不记得她的样子了
I don't even remember what she looks like.

22
00:00:54,568 --> 00:00:56,568
-哥们 你明显喜欢她  -你难道不能
-Dude, you obviously like her.  -Can't you read

23
00:00:56,584 --> 00:00:57,767
推理的么 泰德
between the lines, Ted?

24
00:00:57,777 --> 00:00:59,110
我显然是喜欢她啊
I obviously like her.

25
00:00:59,120 --> 00:01:00,703
这事怎么会在我身上发生呢
How did this happen to me?

26
00:01:00,716 --> 00:01:03,950
从何时开始 我变得这么伤感多情啊
When did I become such a gooey romantic?

27
00:01:05,450 --> 00:01:06,868
我觉着吧 你应该
Look, I think it's healthy

28
00:01:06,879 --> 00:01:09,629
真心的对待女人 而不是把她们看成玩意
that you have real feelings for a woman

29
00:01:09,650 --> 00:01:11,650
这样比较健康向上
instead of just seeing her as an object.

30
00:01:11,665 --> 00:01:12,998
换妞
Switch?

31
00:01:13,009 --> 00:01:13,724
换妞
Sure.

32
00:01:15,158 --> 00:01:16,191
可是 为什么是奎恩呢
But why Quinn?

33
00:01:16,200 --> 00:01:17,732
你只是跟她睡了一觉
I mean, you spent one night with her,

34
00:01:17,744 --> 00:01:18,910
而且她还有点卑鄙
and she was kind of mean.

35
00:01:18,920 --> 00:01:20,303
我们有共鸣啊
We just connected.

36
00:01:20,314 --> 00:01:23,265
情感上 心智上 精神上
Emotionally, intellectually, spiritually.

37
00:01:23,286 --> 00:01:24,252
就是说 是灵肉一体呗 
So, mind-blowing sex?

38
00:01:24,261 --> 00:01:27,062
是灵肉一体啊
Mind-blowing sex!

39
00:01:27,082 --> 00:01:30,750
那之后的一个小时 我简直目不交睫
For an hour afterwards, I couldn't uncross my eyes.

40
00:01:30,777 --> 00:01:33,528
我一边看着她 一边回想跟她爱爱
Which was awesome, because when I went back for seconds,

41
00:01:33,548 --> 00:01:35,881
像是跟双胞胎玩三P啊 矮油太爽了
it was like having a three-way with twins.

42
00:01:35,898 --> 00:01:37,982
那给她打电话呗
So... call her.

43
00:01:37,998 --> 00:01:40,231
要是能打 我早打了
I would if I knew how to get in touch with her,

44
00:01:40,248 --> 00:01:42,182
我联系不上她啊 我要崩溃了
but I can't, and it's driving me crazy.

45
00:01:42,197 --> 00:01:43,396
我眼目所及 全都是她
Everywhere I look, I see her.

46
00:01:43,406 --> 00:01:44,822
她在街头漫步
I see her walking on the street;

47
00:01:44,833 --> 00:01:47,450
她在商店购物
I see her shopping in the store;

48
00:01:47,469 --> 00:01:49,486
她还在那跳钢管舞啊
I see her dancing on that pole.

49
00:01:49,502 --> 00:01:51,585
我也看见她在跳钢管舞
I see her dancing on that pole, too.

50
00:01:51,601 --> 00:01:53,935
额滴神啊 那就是奎恩
Oh, my God, that's Quinn.

51
00:01:53,952 --> 00:01:57,136
先生们 有请卡玛
Gentlemen, give it up for Karma.

52
00:01:58,054 --> 00:02:00,313

54
00:02:04,834 --> 00:02:09,353
HIMYM字幕组倾情奉献

55
00:02:10,049 --> 00:02:11,666
真感谢你俩让我住这
I really appreciate you guys taking me in.

56
00:02:11,678 --> 00:02:12,727
我是说
I mean,

57
00:02:12,736 --> 00:02:14,236
现在我无家可归
I'm homeless,

58
00:02:14,248 --> 00:02:16,498
而且和泰德之间还是不清不楚
things between me and Ted are still kind of weird.

59
00:02:16,515 --> 00:02:18,798
能有朋友陪着我 感觉真好啊
So, it's nice to be around friends.

60
00:02:18,815 --> 00:02:20,649
亲爱滴 你想呆多久都行
Well, stay as long as you want, sweetie.

61
00:02:20,664 --> 00:02:21,862
谢谢
Oh, thank you.

62
00:02:21,871 --> 00:02:23,221
唔
Mm.

63
00:02:23,232 --> 00:02:25,399
我给你准备了一本日记
Now, I got you a journal.

64
00:02:25,416 --> 00:02:26,665
虽然听上去挺二的
I know this sounds lame,

65
00:02:26,675 --> 00:02:29,343
但是写写心情 确实能帮你排解郁闷
but it really helps work through stuff to write about it.

66
00:02:29,363 --> 00:02:30,695
喔
Oh.

67
00:02:30,706 --> 00:02:33,440
亲爱的日记 弄死马修他妈的梦想
"Dear Diary. The fantasies of killing Marshall's mom

68
00:02:33,460 --> 00:02:34,643
就快要实现了
"Have become more vivid.

69
00:02:34,652 --> 00:02:36,635
-今天 我扒了她...  -啊喔
-Today, I scalped her with a .."  - Whoops,

70
00:02:36,651 --> 00:02:38,451
这本是我的
that one's mine.

71
00:02:39,555 --> 00:02:41,438
在这儿好好享受吧
You are going to have so much fun here.

72
00:02:41,454 --> 00:02:42,484
噢 你们不用费心
Oh, guys, please, do not

73
00:02:42,485 --> 00:02:44,288
非要给我找点乐子
feel like you have to keep me entertained.

74
00:02:44,644 --> 00:02:46,544
哦 罗宾 要是你不想找乐子的话
Well, you shouldn't have come to East Meadow, Long Island,

75
00:02:46,559 --> 00:02:48,359
那你就不该来东梅多的长岛哦
Robin, if you didn't want to be entertained.

76
00:02:48,373 --> 00:02:50,673
真的么 我真心不觉着这地方有啥好玩的
Really? I didn't think there was a ton to do here.

77
00:02:50,690 --> 00:02:53,024
很明显 某人没听说过
Oh, apparently, someone hasn't heard

78
00:02:53,041 --> 00:02:55,158
尤宁代尔的袖珍博物馆
of the Uniondale Miniatures Museum.

79
00:02:55,174 --> 00:02:57,391
你可以欣赏19世纪的顶针艺术
You'll come for the 19th century thimble art,

80
00:02:57,408 --> 00:03:00,993
不过首先你就会被瓶盖上的荷兰大师吸引住
but you'll stay for the Dutch masters on bottle caps.

81
00:03:01,019 --> 00:03:01,884
还有
Plus,

82
00:03:01,892 --> 00:03:03,058
你可以跟东梅多野猫队的
you'll be bowling with two

83
00:03:03,067 --> 00:03:06,402
两位创始人打保龄哦
charter members of the East Meadow Alley Cats.

84
00:03:07,097 --> 00:03:08,147
我们队致力于
"We're a hot dog eating team

85
00:03:08,156 --> 00:03:09,856
用打保龄的方法吃热狗
with a bowling problem."

86
00:03:09,869 --> 00:03:10,868
这主意
Shirley

87
00:03:10,877 --> 00:03:12,409
是雪莉想出来的
came up with that one.

88
00:03:12,421 --> 00:03:13,471
她玩得很好哦
Great bowler, Shirley.

89
00:03:13,480 --> 00:03:15,480
那天她得了280的高分哦
She hit 280 the other day.

90
00:03:15,495 --> 00:03:19,096
可惜了 那个高分出现在她浴室的体重秤上
Unfortunately, that was on her bathroom scale.

91
00:03:19,910 --> 00:03:21,194
罗宾搬走后
When Robin moved out,

92
00:03:21,205 --> 00:03:22,988
我的生活就像她空空的房间一样
there was a hole in my life

93
00:03:23,001 --> 00:03:24,884
变得空虚 寂寞
in the shape of an empty bedroom.

94
00:03:24,899 --> 00:03:27,516
我找了个新消遣来填满它
I filled it with a new hobby.

95
00:03:30,726 --> 00:03:32,443
你在我以前的屋里干啥呢
What are you doing in my old room?

96
00:03:32,457 --> 00:03:34,290
这屋空荡荡的 搞得我异常沮丧
This room being empty was bumming me out,

97
00:03:34,304 --> 00:03:36,020
所以我决定找点健康向上的活儿干
so I decided to do something healthy

98
00:03:36,033 --> 00:03:37,483
然后我就不会再想你了
that would take my mind off you.

99
00:03:37,495 --> 00:03:38,944
噢 在一个不通风的密室里
Well, nothing says healthy

100
00:03:38,955 --> 00:03:41,089
闻着四十磅熏猪排的滚滚浓烟
like smoking 40 pounds of pork loin

101
00:03:41,105 --> 00:03:42,437
臆想着跟你前女友的对话
in an unventilated room

102
00:03:42,448 --> 00:03:44,949
这真是健康向上哦 亲
while having an imaginary conversation with your ex.

103
00:03:44,968 --> 00:03:47,268
就凭这句话 烤猪排没你的份了
Just for that, you're not getting any.

104
00:03:47,285 --> 00:03:48,484
我分不到烤猪排
I'm not getting any?

105
00:03:48,494 --> 00:03:50,361
你是那个快被油烟熏熟的人
You're the one smoking your own meat.

106
00:03:50,375 --> 00:03:51,424
我闪咯
Oh!

107
00:03:53,281 --> 00:03:55,999
我该怎么处理奎恩这档子事儿啊
What am I gonna do about this Quinn thing?

108
00:03:56,019 --> 00:03:57,418
我想再约她出来一次
I want to ask her out again,

109
00:03:57,429 --> 00:03:59,529
但我又不知道该怎么面对她是个脱衣舞女这现状
but I don't know how I feel about her being a stripper.

110
00:03:59,545 --> 00:04:02,162
你怎么会烦这个
Why would you have an issue with that?

111
00:04:02,181 --> 00:04:04,815
我的意思是 你约会过重刑女犯 军火贩子
I mean, you've dated convicted felons, arms dealers...

112
00:04:04,835 --> 00:04:06,418
选美妈妈
pageant moms.

113
00:04:06,430 --> 00:04:10,382
嘿 我对奎恩这事儿可是真心的
Hey, Quinn is someone I might want to get serious with,

114
00:04:10,410 --> 00:04:14,879
而不是装作能帮她四岁女儿获得儿童选美冠军的裁判
not just pretend to be a judge who can help her four year old clinch Little Miss Biloxi

115
00:04:14,911 --> 00:04:18,163
蒂凡尼的妈妈真的很想让女儿夺冠
Tiffany's mom really wanted that tiara.

116
00:04:18,186 --> 00:04:21,253
这是个拥有八百万人口的城市
In a city of eight million people,

117
00:04:21,276 --> 00:04:24,377
仅仅是因为偶然 让你走进了那家她工作的俱乐部
you happened to walk into the club where she works?

118
00:04:24,399 --> 00:04:25,432
或许就是命运
Maybe it's destiny.

119
00:04:25,441 --> 00:04:27,825
不对 那个叫命运的舞女在马龙派许俱乐部跳舞
No, Destiny strips at The Melon Patch.

120
00:04:27,843 --> 00:04:30,443
她们可都是人 泰德 尽量跟上我的节奏
They're people, Ted; try to keep them straight.

121
00:04:31,200 --> 00:04:33,134
等一等
Wait a minute.

122
00:04:33,149 --> 00:04:36,334
如果这就是命运呢
What if this is destiny?

123
00:04:36,357 --> 00:04:37,239
我刚刚说的
I just said...

124
00:04:37,247 --> 00:04:38,863
如果这是宇宙出于某种原因
What if the universe

125
00:04:38,875 --> 00:04:41,927
将我们推向了彼此的人生道路呢
is throwing us in each other's path for some reason?

126
00:04:41,950 --> 00:04:43,149
这差不多就是我刚刚
More or less exactly what I...

127
00:04:43,159 --> 00:04:45,942
我不管你说了什么 这就是命运
I don't care what you say, this is destiny!

128
00:04:45,962 --> 00:04:47,012
擦嘞 泰德
Damn it, Ted!

129
00:04:47,021 --> 00:04:49,271
你为什么就是不能感受到爱情呢
Why can't you ever root for love?

130
00:04:54,615 --> 00:04:55,598
嘿
Hey.

131
00:04:55,606 --> 00:04:57,240
嘿
Hey.

132
00:04:57,253 --> 00:04:58,385
奎恩
Quinn...

133
00:04:58,395 --> 00:04:59,561
不 听着
No, listen,

134
00:04:59,570 --> 00:05:01,537
在这儿 我叫卡玛 明白
in here I'm Karma, okay?

135
00:05:01,552 --> 00:05:02,650
明白
Got it.

136
00:05:02,660 --> 00:05:03,960
嗯 看啊 卡玛
Uh, look, Karma,

137
00:05:03,970 --> 00:05:04,969
我发誓
I swear

138
00:05:04,978 --> 00:05:07,161
我从来没说过这些 但是
I never say crap like this, but...

139
00:05:07,177 --> 00:05:08,377
我想也许苍天正在
I think maybe the universe

140
00:05:08,387 --> 00:05:10,770
告诉我们一些事情
is telling us something.

141
00:05:10,788 --> 00:05:12,388
你愿意再跟我出去约会一次么
You want to go out again?

142
00:05:12,401 --> 00:05:14,785
哦 不好意思 我从来不和顾客约会的
I'm sorry, I don't date customers.

143
00:05:14,803 --> 00:05:16,102
看在命运的份上呢
What about destiny?

144
00:05:16,112 --> 00:05:18,029
我听说她去马龙派许俱乐部了啊
I heard she's over at The Melon Patch now.

145
00:05:18,044 --> 00:05:21,745
不 我的意思是 老天爷希望我们俩之间能...
No, I mean like fate telling us that we're supposed to be...

146
00:05:21,771 --> 00:05:22,937
哦 听着 巴尼
Oh, listen, Barney,

147
00:05:22,947 --> 00:05:25,197
我的经理一直在给我眼色
my manager is really giving me the stink eye.

148
00:05:25,214 --> 00:05:27,098
我必须得回去工作了
I have to get back to work.

149
00:05:27,113 --> 00:05:28,145
好吧 等等 等一下
Okay, wait, wait.

150
00:05:28,153 --> 00:05:29,869
如果我花钱雇你跳个舞呢
What if I pay for a dance?

151
00:05:29,883 --> 00:05:30,832
这样的话
That way,

152
00:05:30,840 --> 00:05:31,923
你的经理会很乐于此的
your manager's happy,

153
00:05:31,932 --> 00:05:33,264
而且 这样我就能告诉你
and then I can to tell you

154
00:05:33,275 --> 00:05:35,058
你为什么应该和我再去约会一次了
why you should go on another date with me.

155
00:05:35,072 --> 00:05:37,840
我想我没理由不去啊
I guess there's no reason why not.

156
00:05:37,860 --> 00:05:40,594
好的 首先 我们有很多相似点
Okay, first off, we have a lot in common.

157
00:05:40,614 --> 00:05:41,997
比如
For example,

158
00:05:42,008 --> 00:05:44,124
我们俩的工作都是靠
both of our jobs are largely financed

159
00:05:44,140 --> 00:05:47,325
那些喝醉的亚洲阔佬的巨额资金支持的
by drunk Asian businessmen.

160
00:05:47,349 --> 00:05:49,216
亲爱的日记
Dear Diary.

161
00:05:49,230 --> 00:05:51,230
这是来到这个岛上的第四天
It is day four on this island,

162
00:05:51,245 --> 00:05:53,578
这个本地人叫做 长岛 的地方
which the natives have dubbed "Long Island,"

163
00:05:53,596 --> 00:05:55,062
之所以叫这个名字
perhaps referencing

164
00:05:55,073 --> 00:05:57,908
大抵是因为在这个岛上 度日如年
how each hour here feels like it may never end.

165
00:05:57,929 --> 00:06:00,212
目前为止 他们还是欢迎我的
So far, they have welcomed me

166
00:06:00,229 --> 00:06:04,264
让我对他们那奇葩的生活略有所见
and given me a rare glimpse into their bizarre way of life.

167
00:06:04,293 --> 00:06:07,461
如果说娱乐 对他们而言 就是桌面滑球
By "Entertainment," They mean table shuffle board,

168
00:06:07,484 --> 00:06:11,586
手工活儿 或者其他完全没有任何激情的活动
macramé classes, and other non-stimulating activities

169
00:06:11,615 --> 00:06:13,399
这些活动在曼哈顿
which are only used in Manhattan

170
00:06:13,413 --> 00:06:16,881
都是用来戒毒和降低犯罪率的
to calm down drug addicts and the criminally insane.

171
00:06:16,906 --> 00:06:20,674
他们那儿饭店的菜单上居然有图片
A preliterate society, their menus display pictures

172
00:06:20,701 --> 00:06:22,918
好像身处史前社会
of the food they offer,

173
00:06:22,935 --> 00:06:25,202
在餐厅吃饭的时候 一顿饭的功夫
everyone is forced to sing "Happy Birthday"

174
00:06:25,219 --> 00:06:27,786
要被迫唱四五次生日快乐歌
four or five times a meal,

175
00:06:27,805 --> 00:06:31,690
甜点竟然插了烟花
and dessert has fireworks in it.

176
00:06:31,717 --> 00:06:34,852
在家里 莉莉马修总是套着
In their lairs, they often don a primitive shroud

177
00:06:34,875 --> 00:06:38,577
裹尸布一样被称作"窝舒服"的披风
called a "Snugget," And it is not uncommon for them

178
00:06:38,604 --> 00:06:40,720
而且晚上九点前上床对他们俩来说司空见惯
to go to sleep before 9 p.M.,

179
00:06:40,736 --> 00:06:42,569
对夜晚
fearing, as they do,

180
00:06:42,583 --> 00:06:44,216
他们表现的无比恐惧
the night.

181
00:06:44,287 --> 00:06:46,354
还有日记 我认为写你真是愚蠢至极
Also Diary, I think writing in you is stupid,

182
00:06:46,369 --> 00:06:47,635
但是你是莉莉给的礼物
but you were a gift from Lily,

183
00:06:47,646 --> 00:06:49,179
而且现在她在看着我
and she's watching me right now.

184
00:06:49,191 --> 00:06:52,743
伙计们 嗯 我不打算在这里留太久
Guys, um, I don't want to overstay my welcome,

185
00:06:52,768 --> 00:06:55,501
而且帕瑞斯说可以接待我
and Patrice said that she would take me off your hands.

186
00:06:55,521 --> 00:06:58,539
所以 你们有火车的时刻表么
So, do you have a train schedule or...

187
00:06:58,561 --> 00:06:59,811
哦 是的
Oh, yeah,

188
00:06:59,822 --> 00:07:00,821
但是 但是 额
um, but-but

189
00:07:00,829 --> 00:07:03,663
火车出了点问题
there's a-a problem with the train.

190
00:07:03,684 --> 00:07:05,383
老大老大的问题
Big, big problem.

191
00:07:05,396 --> 00:07:06,295
有个
There was a...

192
00:07:06,303 --> 00:07:08,570
- 罢工  - 一道闪电
- Strike.  - A lightning strike.

193
00:07:08,587 --> 00:07:11,788
闪电击中了一个正在罢工的列车员
That hit one of the picketers who was on strike.

194
00:07:11,812 --> 00:07:13,946
在一场雷雨中
During a thunderstorm.

195
00:07:13,962 --> 00:07:17,964
再说了
Plus,

196
00:07:17,992 --> 00:07:21,126
她可能并不希望你去
Yeah, she probably doesn't even want you there.

197
00:07:25,178 --> 00:07:26,596
你们俩怎么这么神神叨叨的
You guys are being weird.

198
00:07:27,143 --> 00:07:29,778
哦 哦
Oh! Oh!

199
00:07:29,798 --> 00:07:32,449
哦 我的天呐 对不起 罗宾
Oh, my God, Robin, I am so sorry.

200
00:07:32,468 --> 00:07:34,068
我会把这些拿去洗的
I'll throw these in the wash.

201
00:07:34,081 --> 00:07:36,998
它们明天一早准干
They'll be dry and folded in the morning.

202
00:07:37,019 --> 00:07:38,502
也有可能周末弄好
Or the weekend.

203
00:07:38,514 --> 00:07:40,180
到时候咱们再好好谈谈你搬走的事情
And we can talk about you leaving then.

204
00:07:40,193 --> 00:07:41,543
要不就永远别谈了
Or never.

205
00:07:41,554 --> 00:07:44,054
等下 莉莉 为啥不
Wait, Lily, why don't...

206
00:07:44,073 --> 00:07:46,073
差一刻钟就九点了 睡觉觉去喽
eight forty-five, time to hit the hay.

207
00:07:46,088 --> 00:07:48,172
晚安咯
Good night!

208
00:07:54,098 --> 00:07:55,932
那 泰德 你现在有啥
So Ted, what healthy,

209
00:07:55,946 --> 00:07:58,480
强身健体充满理智的新爱好了
not-at-all-crazy activity are you up to now?

210
00:07:58,499 --> 00:08:02,167
我之前迷恋过烤肉 但是我现在另有所爱了
I liked smoking meat, but now I've got a new passion:

211
00:08:02,193 --> 00:08:03,793
木工
wood.

212
00:08:03,805 --> 00:08:06,839
你确定你说了什么的 对吧
You hear these things that come out of your mouth, right?

213
00:08:12,537 --> 00:08:14,605
之后我又回到了欲望之豹
So I went back to the Lusty Leopard.

214
00:08:14,621 --> 00:08:16,137
你知道吗 巴尼
You know what, Barney?

215
00:08:16,149 --> 00:08:19,184
我之前立下过不和客人约会的规矩的
I know I said I have a rule about not dating customers,

216
00:08:19,206 --> 00:08:23,108
但是你有点说服我去
but you may have convinced me to...

217
00:08:23,136 --> 00:08:24,685
可惜了
Oh.

218
00:08:24,697 --> 00:08:26,130
音乐停了 我得走了
Song's over, I got to go.

219
00:08:26,141 --> 00:08:28,374
等下 不对 我说服你干什么啊 
Wait, no, what? Convinced you to what?

220
00:08:28,391 --> 00:08:31,359
不好意思啊 可是经理的眼神好凶好凶的
I'm sorry, but manager's giving me the stink eye.

221
00:08:31,381 --> 00:08:33,681
擦 找点事做啊 经理
Ugh, get a life, Manager.

222
00:08:34,739 --> 00:08:36,272
你刚刚想说啥的
What were you saying?

223
00:08:36,284 --> 00:08:38,702
就是 我刚刚想说
Well, I was going to say

224
00:08:38,720 --> 00:08:42,405
那个 我觉得你啊 好迷人的
that I do find you very... charming.

225
00:08:43,169 --> 00:08:44,970
又那么风趣
And funny...

226
00:08:44,984 --> 00:08:46,433
还这么性感呢
and sexy.

227
00:08:46,445 --> 00:08:49,296
而且 是智慧与激情完美结合的说
And exciting and smart.

228
00:08:49,317 --> 00:08:51,651
知老夫者 莫过于君
You so get me.

229
00:08:51,668 --> 00:08:53,367
巴尼 你知道吗
You know what, Barney?

230
00:08:53,380 --> 00:08:55,881
这是人家第一次了啦
I have never done this before,

231
00:08:55,900 --> 00:08:59,601
但是你实在是太太太特别了
but there's just something about you.

232
00:08:59,628 --> 00:09:01,312
所以 我猜 我的答案是
So I guess my answer is...

233
00:09:01,325 --> 00:09:02,857
真糟糕
Oh.

234
00:09:02,869 --> 00:09:03,868
音乐又停了
The song's over.

235
00:09:03,876 --> 00:09:05,593
天呐 快说完啊
Well, just finish the thought!

236
00:09:05,607 --> 00:09:07,140
经理我好怕怕的呀 额滴神啊
But the manager. God,

237
00:09:07,152 --> 00:09:08,151
我恨死经理了
I hate manager.

238
00:09:10,107 --> 00:09:12,474
喏 给你钱 你的答案是
There. Your answer is...

239
00:09:12,492 --> 00:09:14,909
也许我们需要深入了解对方
Maybe if we knew each other a little better.

240
00:09:15,918 --> 00:09:16,934
自我介绍一下啊
Tell me about yourself.

241
00:09:16,942 --> 00:09:18,942
那个 这个 告诉你些什么呢
Well, um, what can I tell you?

242
00:09:18,958 --> 00:09:19,957
我 就是
I'm, um...

243
00:09:19,965 --> 00:09:22,132
迷人 还有 风趣
charming and funny

244
00:09:22,149 --> 00:09:24,766
性感 还有
and sexy and...

245
00:09:24,785 --> 00:09:28,337
激情和智慧
exciting and smart.

246
00:09:28,363 --> 00:09:30,363
是啊 小女子哪有拒绝的本事啊
Well, how can a girl say no to that?

247
00:09:30,378 --> 00:09:32,745
要不我们
How about we...

248
00:09:32,762 --> 00:09:34,728
出去 来
go out on...

249
00:09:34,743 --> 00:09:38,528
一个 呃 就是
aaaaaaaaa...

250
00:09:38,556 --> 00:09:40,390
就是 那个 呃
aaaaaa...

251
00:09:40,404 --> 00:09:42,120
这些音乐时间太短了
Ugh, these songs are so short.

252
00:09:45,087 --> 00:09:48,606
那么 你到底给了奎恩多少钱阿
Uh, how much exactly did you give Quinn?

253
00:09:48,966 --> 00:09:49,499
八 九百 刀吧
Eight, nine hundred bucks,

254
00:09:49,511 --> 00:09:52,345
还有我的劳力士表
plus whatever my Rolex is worth.

255
00:09:52,365 --> 00:09:53,531
这个有点
Whoa.

256
00:09:53,541 --> 00:09:54,573
我懂
I know.

257
00:09:54,582 --> 00:09:57,616
泰德 我觉得我恋爱了
Ted, I think I'm in love.

258
00:10:05,339 --> 00:10:06,957
奎恩就是在玩你呢
Quinn is totally playing you.

259
00:10:06,969 --> 00:10:07,934
啥
What?

260
00:10:07,943 --> 00:10:09,426
乱说
That's ridiculous.

261
00:10:09,438 --> 00:10:10,671
如果她是在玩我的话
If she were playing me,

262
00:10:10,681 --> 00:10:12,664
她会答应和我约会吗
why would she agree to go on a date with me?

263
00:10:12,679 --> 00:10:15,096
你和其他那些臭男人不一样
You're different than the rest of these schlubs.

264
00:10:15,114 --> 00:10:18,615
就只有这一次哦 我会打破我的规矩
This one time only, I'm going to break my rule.

265
00:10:18,640 --> 00:10:20,504
我们明天出去玩吧
Let's go out tomorrow night.

266
00:10:20,542 --> 00:10:21,742
好极了
Sweet!

267
00:10:21,808 --> 00:10:25,170
噢 我去 我明天得上班 擦
Oh, shoot! I have to work tomorrow. Ugh!

268
00:10:25,682 --> 00:10:27,713
要不 头脑风暴一下
Hey! Brainstorm!

269
00:10:27,752 --> 00:10:29,497
如果我们就在这里幽会呢
What if we just have our date here,

270
00:10:30,205 --> 00:10:31,577
说定了
It's a date.

271
00:10:32,040 --> 00:10:33,470
这算哪门子约会 这只是
It's not a date, if you go

272
00:10:33,471 --> 00:10:35,891
在脱衣舞夜总会的钱色交易而已
into a strip club and paying for lap dances.

273
00:10:35,918 --> 00:10:38,826
如果不是约会 她怎么会说来四次送一次呢
If it's not a date, why'd she say, every fifth day was free?

274
00:10:38,877 --> 00:10:40,660
因为这是欲望之豹在每周五晚上的
Because that's the Lusty Leopard's policy

275
00:10:40,674 --> 00:10:43,341
优惠政策啊  连我都知道 奇了怪了
on Friday nights, and I'm so mad at you that I know that!

276
00:10:43,361 --> 00:10:47,046
日记君
Dear Diary.

277
00:10:47,072 --> 00:10:48,989
这是我到这个岛上的第六天
It is day six on this island,

278
00:10:49,004 --> 00:10:52,722
我开始感觉我不是客人 而是被软禁起来了
and I begin to fear I am more captive than guest...

279
00:10:54,663 --> 00:10:56,046
早安 亲爱的
Morning, sweetie.

280
00:10:56,057 --> 00:10:58,057
门球主要是老年人的运动

281
00:10:56,057 --> 00:10:58,057
准备好打门球了吗 
Up for croquet?

282
00:10:59,112 --> 00:11:01,480
嘿 对了 莉儿 我的衣服
Hey, uh, Lil, are you done

283
00:11:01,498 --> 00:11:03,632
你洗好了没有 因为我还
washing my clothes yet? Because I...

284
00:11:03,648 --> 00:11:04,864
噢 非常抱歉
Oh, I am so sorry.

285
00:11:04,874 --> 00:11:06,957
你的衣服无意间混到了
Your clothes accidentally wound up in the bag

286
00:11:06,973 --> 00:11:09,023
我要捐出去的袋子里
I donated to Goodwill.

287
00:11:09,776 --> 00:11:11,226
你把我的衣服送走了
You gave away my clothes?

288
00:11:11,238 --> 00:11:14,206
这个在东梅多还是蛮拉风的
They were a bit fancy for East Meadow.

289
00:11:14,228 --> 00:11:16,395
大伙儿都盯着看呢
People were staring.

290
00:11:16,411 --> 00:11:19,996
另外 我们还有一个多余的窝舒服哦
Besides, we have an extra Snugget.

291
00:11:21,146 --> 00:11:22,696
试试看
Try it.

292
00:11:24,001 --> 00:11:25,885
穿上试试 罗宾
Try it, Robin.

293
00:11:27,830 --> 00:11:29,831
他们打算把我同化成他们那样 日记君
They're trying to make me one of them, Diary.

294
00:11:29,846 --> 00:11:32,763
而且我开始后怕
And I begin to fear...

295
00:11:32,785 --> 00:11:35,169
我可能还蛮喜欢的
I may like it!

296
00:11:37,789 --> 00:11:39,790
我真不敢相信在这个脱衣舞夜总会里
I can't believe we're at a strip club,

297
00:11:39,805 --> 00:11:42,105
最大的蠢蛋就是你啊
and the biggest boob in here is you.

298
00:11:42,122 --> 00:11:44,489
这是个真正的约会 泰德
It's a real date, Ted.

299
00:11:44,507 --> 00:11:47,508
而且很明显你还没看见大傻波的双峰呢
And clearly you haven't seen the DeSalvo twins.

300
00:11:47,530 --> 00:11:48,780
喏 就是她
She's right over there.

301
00:11:48,790 --> 00:11:50,873
巴尼 够大
Barney... Yowza!

302
00:11:50,889 --> 00:11:53,539
你并不是在约会
You are not on a date.

303
00:11:53,558 --> 00:11:54,875
好吧 去证明下 
Okay, look, prove it.

304
00:11:54,886 --> 00:11:57,453
去证明她不是在利用你
Prove that she's not just taking advantage of you.

305
00:11:57,472 --> 00:11:59,889
把她带到别的地方去
Get her to go out with you anywhere but here.

306
00:11:59,907 --> 00:12:01,156
好吧
Fine!

307
00:12:01,166 --> 00:12:03,633
嗨 帅哥 想看我跳个舞吗
Hey, sexy! You want a dance?

308
00:12:03,652 --> 00:12:04,985
好啊
Yeah!

309
00:12:04,995 --> 00:12:06,495
但是 有件事我得说下
Uh, one thing, though.

310
00:12:06,507 --> 00:12:08,840
你不会介意
Um, you'd be okay with us having a date

311
00:12:08,858 --> 00:12:10,674
我们去别的地方约会 对吧
somewhere besides here, wouldn't you?

312
00:12:10,688 --> 00:12:13,239
我一直在等你这句话呢
I was hoping you would ask that.

313
00:12:13,258 --> 00:12:15,976
真抱歉哟 虽然这里有点小贵
I'm sorry it's so expensive in here,

314
00:12:15,996 --> 00:12:18,112
但是既漂亮又私密哟 对吧
but it's nice and private, huh?

315
00:12:18,128 --> 00:12:19,595
当然啦 还超浪漫呢
Absolutely. And romantic!

316
00:12:19,607 --> 00:12:21,723
这可是我们俩第一次单独约会呢
It's our first getaway as a couple!

317
00:12:23,115 --> 00:12:24,449
亲爱的日记 有一个念头变得越来越清晰了
It's become clear to me, Diary,

318
00:12:24,459 --> 00:12:26,342
那就是 我必须上演一场逃亡大戏
that I must attempt a dramatic escape.

319
00:12:26,357 --> 00:12:29,575
我会在晚餐的时候假装胃疼
I will fake a stomach ache during dinner.

320
00:12:29,598 --> 00:12:31,798
在马修和莉莉去渡宾果之夜以后
Then, after Marshall and Lily leave for bingo night,

321
00:12:31,815 --> 00:12:33,949
我会溜到后门
I will sneak out the back.

322
00:12:33,965 --> 00:12:36,832
去偷雪莉的滑轮车 再开去车站
I'll swipe Shirley's Rascal and drive to the train station.

323
00:12:36,853 --> 00:12:38,886
顺便说一下 她都42了居然还骑滑轮车
Shirley's 42, by the way, and rides a Rascal.

324
00:12:38,901 --> 00:12:42,754
我敢说 这儿的人跟机器人总动员里的一样退化了
I swear, it's the second half of Wall-E out here.

325
00:12:44,947 --> 00:12:46,631
抓到你了
Bingo...

326
00:12:47,701 --> 00:12:50,486
宾果之夜取消了
was canceled.

327
00:12:54,234 --> 00:12:57,169
嗨 帅哥 想看我跳舞吗
Hey, sexy, you want a dance?

328
00:12:57,191 --> 00:12:59,558
不 我不是来玩的
No, I'm not a customer.

329
00:12:59,575 --> 00:13:01,057
我女朋友在这里工作
My girlfriend works here.

330
00:13:01,069 --> 00:13:03,870
她在那边呢
She's right over...

331
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:05,959
就这一次 我破例跟我的顾客约会
This one time only, I'm gonna break my rule.

332
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:07,426
我们明晚约会吧
Let's go out tomorrow night!

333
00:13:07,438 --> 00:13:08,387
太棒了
Sweet!

334
00:13:08,395 --> 00:13:09,678
哦 糟糕了
Oh, shoot!

335
00:13:09,688 --> 00:13:12,805
我明天要上班 擦
I have to work tomorrow. Ugh!

336
00:13:12,828 --> 00:13:14,061
嘿 头脑风暴
Hey! Brainstorm!

337
00:13:14,071 --> 00:13:15,988
不如我们在这儿约会
What if we just have our date here,

338
00:13:16,003 --> 00:13:19,454
也许去那个专属包间
maybe in the Champagne Room?

339
00:13:21,660 --> 00:13:24,196
那可是我们地儿
That was our spot.

340
00:13:27,306 --> 00:13:28,923
嗨 帅哥 想看我跳个舞吗
Hey, gorgeous, You want a dance?

341
00:13:29,943 --> 00:13:31,377
又是个圈套么
Is it a jig?

342
00:13:31,388 --> 00:13:33,488
如果是的话 该结束了
'Cause if so, it's up.

343
00:13:34,175 --> 00:13:35,742
抱歉 我的情感跟麻辣老师
Sorry, I only had the last verse

344
00:13:35,754 --> 00:13:38,255
麻辣老师最后一句歌词是"噢 我的天哪"

345
00:13:35,754 --> 00:13:38,255
最后一句一样 刚那算啥
of "Hot For Teacher" To work on that. What was that?

346
00:13:38,274 --> 00:13:42,175
你用昨天对我说的话去糊弄那个男的
You laid exactly the same line on that guy that you did on me!

347
00:13:42,202 --> 00:13:43,218
小甜心 那些话
Sweetie, that is just something

348
00:13:43,227 --> 00:13:45,895
我只对那些容易上当的二货们说
I say to these gullible losers here.

349
00:13:45,915 --> 00:13:47,531
他们每次都会相信哟
They fall for it every time.

350
00:13:47,544 --> 00:13:51,346
一帮笨蛋
Bunch of losers!

351
00:13:51,373 --> 00:13:53,373
噢 天哪 经理又来了
Oh, gosh, manager again.

352
00:13:53,388 --> 00:13:54,587
他看着我好像在说
He's looking at me like,

353
00:13:54,597 --> 00:13:56,347
卡玛 你们为啥不去
"Karma, why aren't you booking more time

354
00:13:56,361 --> 00:13:57,526
专属套房呆会呢
in the Champagne Room?"

355
00:13:57,535 --> 00:13:59,869
当然没问题了
Well, we'll show him.

356
00:13:59,887 --> 00:14:02,504
不 你又在玩我
No! You're playing me again!

357
00:14:02,523 --> 00:14:05,074
你的谎话还真是张口就来啊
And you're not even trying hard!

358
00:14:05,093 --> 00:14:06,893
经理压根就不在 你在指一个盆栽
There's no manager there; You're pointing at a fern!

359
00:14:08,753 --> 00:14:10,370
泰德是对的
Ted was right.

360
00:14:10,383 --> 00:14:13,234
我敢说他一定在家 嘲笑我有多二
I bet he's home right now, laughing at how dumb I am.

361
00:14:18,746 --> 00:14:21,447
我这是不是报应呢 当然了
Did I deserve this? Absolutely.

362
00:14:21,467 --> 00:14:24,468
哥也说过些无耻的谎话
I have told some outrageous lies.

363
00:14:24,490 --> 00:14:26,841
我曾告诉别的妞
I have told women I was famous,

364
00:14:26,858 --> 00:14:28,224
我是个有名的战时英雄
a war hero,

365
00:14:28,235 --> 00:14:30,718
和我滚床单的话 就能够治愈近视
that sex with me would cure their nearsightedness.

366
00:14:30,737 --> 00:14:32,370
巴尼 是你
Barney?!

367
00:14:34,280 --> 00:14:37,699
你对我做的这些 可能都是我应得的报应
I probably deserved everything you did to me and more.

368
00:14:37,724 --> 00:14:39,390
但是我一直在努力
But I have been trying,

369
00:14:39,403 --> 00:14:42,387
努力去成为一个更好的人
and trying hard to be a better person.

370
00:14:43,130 --> 00:14:44,180
谢谢你刚让我明白了
Thanks for showing me

371
00:14:44,189 --> 00:14:45,738
我原来的生活方式没错
I had it right before.

372
00:14:53,290 --> 00:14:57,126
这么说吧 很抱歉让你感觉有点压抑
Look, I'm sorry we made you feel a little suffocated,

373
00:14:57,153 --> 00:15:00,538
但是你真的要偷偷溜走吗
but were you really just gonna sneak away?

374
00:15:00,563 --> 00:15:03,481
我只是  我真的很想念城里
Well, it's just... I really miss the city.

375
00:15:03,502 --> 00:15:05,835
我也知道你们很爱这里 这挺好的
I know you guys love it here, and that's fine,

376
00:15:05,853 --> 00:15:07,169
我们才不爱这里呢
We don't love it here!

377
00:15:07,179 --> 00:15:07,844
啥
What?

378
00:15:07,851 --> 00:15:09,017
拜托 罗宾
Come on, Robin,

379
00:15:09,026 --> 00:15:11,043
你没看到这里的生活是什么样的啊
what kind of life is this?

380
00:15:11,059 --> 00:15:12,642
去参加无聊的凯纳斯特纸牌联赛
Going to canasta tournaments

381
00:15:12,654 --> 00:15:14,354
去高中运动场看所谓的曲棍球季后赛
and high school field hockey playoffs?

382
00:15:14,368 --> 00:15:16,952
噢 我觉得北贝拉莫会得冠军的
Oh, I think North Bellmore can take state.

383
00:15:16,971 --> 00:15:18,971
看看苏菲的踝关节  哥表示怀疑
With Sophie's ankle? Doubtful.

384
00:15:18,986 --> 00:15:21,119
好吧 要是你们俩不开心的话
Okay, but if you two are so unhappy,

385
00:15:21,135 --> 00:15:23,135
为什么不直接搬回曼哈顿呢
why don't you just move back to Manhattan?

386
00:15:23,150 --> 00:15:25,851
因为郊区对宝宝比较好啊
Because the suburbs are better for the baby.

387
00:15:25,871 --> 00:15:29,005
谁说的 连你们俩都住着不开心的地方
Who says? Who says any place is better for the baby

388
00:15:29,028 --> 00:15:31,228
会真的对宝宝好吗
if you two are unhappy in it?

389
00:15:33,208 --> 00:15:35,710
不 不 我们现在就住在这儿了
No, no, we live here now.

390
00:15:36,399 --> 00:15:38,117
其实呢 这个地方
And, you know, this place

391
00:15:38,131 --> 00:15:39,597
也没有那么糟啦
wouldn't seem so bad if...

392
00:15:39,608 --> 00:15:42,492
要是我们有一个朋友也搬来这里了的话
we got one of our friends to move out here.

393
00:15:43,168 --> 00:15:44,951
噢 伙计们
Oh, guys...

394
00:15:44,965 --> 00:15:47,933
噢
Oh...

395
00:15:47,954 --> 00:15:50,688
姐自焚也不会留在这儿的
I would rather set myself on fire.

396
00:15:51,234 --> 00:15:54,219
第二天早上 巴尼知道了即使在这个
The next morning, Barney learned that even in

397
00:15:54,241 --> 00:15:57,543
人口八百万的城市 他也躲不开卡玛(报应)
a city of eight million people, there's no escaping Karma.

398
00:16:04,822 --> 00:16:05,838
噢
Oh.

399
00:16:05,846 --> 00:16:07,512
噢 嗨
Oh, hey.

400
00:16:07,525 --> 00:16:10,309
抱歉 哥不能讲话 经理盯着呢
Sorry, can't talk; manager's watching.

401
00:16:12,260 --> 00:16:13,310
听着 要是伤害到你的感情的话
Look, I am sorry

402
00:16:13,319 --> 00:16:15,236
我很抱歉 这只是份工作
if I hurt your feelings; it's a job.

403
00:16:15,251 --> 00:16:16,617
是吗 哥的工作
Yeah, well, at my job,

404
00:16:16,628 --> 00:16:18,544
我们不会为了钱而让别人心碎
we don't rip out people's hearts for money.

405
00:16:18,559 --> 00:16:23,145
我们短暂的支持过朝鲜的一个
My company briefly backed a lab in North Korea

406
00:16:23,177 --> 00:16:25,261
令人心碎的实验室 但是后来还是卖了它
which did, but we sold it!

407
00:16:25,277 --> 00:16:27,193
你知道么 我在这个俱乐部工作了一年
You know, I've worked at that club for a year.

408
00:16:27,208 --> 00:16:28,591
你一直在那儿
You practically live there,

409
00:16:28,602 --> 00:16:30,552
但我们约会时 你都没认出我来
and you didn't even recognize me the night we went out.

410
00:16:30,567 --> 00:16:33,684
你那套小可怜的受害者形象骗不了我
You can't pretend to be some hurt little victim with me.

411
00:16:33,706 --> 00:16:34,756
我了解你
I know you.

412
00:16:34,765 --> 00:16:35,981
好吧 当然你了解我
Well, of course you do.

413
00:16:35,992 --> 00:16:37,557
一些事情我只告诉过你一个人
I told you things I don't tell anybody.

414
00:16:37,569 --> 00:16:38,752
我对你是坦白的
I was honest with you.

415
00:16:38,762 --> 00:16:40,879
切 我不相信你有一个同性恋的黑人哥哥
Yeah, because I believe you have a gay black brother,

416
00:16:40,895 --> 00:16:42,611
一个孤单到快被自己熏熟的朋友
a friend lonely enough to smoke his own meat

417
00:16:42,624 --> 00:16:44,458
还有个新浪潮乐队的粉儿的老妈
and that your mom was a groupie for Supertramp.

418
00:16:44,472 --> 00:16:47,506
他们以她命的乐队的名
They named their band for her!

419
00:16:49,879 --> 00:16:51,662
这些你竟然都记得
You remembered all that?

420
00:16:51,676 --> 00:16:54,060
好吧 是的 我的意思是说
Well, yeah. I mean,

421
00:16:54,077 --> 00:16:55,360
你的故事比放了八千遍的
you're more interesting than the lyrics

422
00:16:55,371 --> 00:16:58,005
“往我身上倒糖”的歌词要有意思
to "Pour Some Sugar On Me" For the 8,000th time.

423
00:17:00,039 --> 00:17:01,623
你知道么 这很奇怪
You know, it's funny.

424
00:17:01,635 --> 00:17:04,803
几乎我见过的每个女人
Almost every woman I've ever met was wrong

425
00:17:04,826 --> 00:17:06,442
都错误地给了我一次机会
to give me a chance.

426
00:17:06,455 --> 00:17:09,606
你却是第一个因为没给我机会而做错的
You're the first woman who's wrong not to.

427
00:17:13,003 --> 00:17:14,304
大杯黑咖啡
Large black coffee...

428
00:17:14,315 --> 00:17:17,349
还有他点的东西
and whatever he's having.

429
00:17:17,371 --> 00:17:18,971
我一起付
It's on me.

430
00:17:19,888 --> 00:17:22,240
我也要一杯咖啡
The same.

431
00:17:22,258 --> 00:17:23,674
谢谢
Thank you.

432
00:17:23,685 --> 00:17:26,102
别客气
You're welcome.

433
00:17:26,120 --> 00:17:29,121
再请1700杯咖啡 我俩就扯平了
1,700 more of these and we're even.

434
00:17:29,143 --> 00:17:31,126
呀 这首歌刚刚结束了
Uh, the song just ended.

435
00:17:31,141 --> 00:17:32,974
是不是意味着你要走了
That mean you got to get going?

436
00:17:32,988 --> 00:17:35,289
不
No.

437
00:17:35,307 --> 00:17:37,357
你有空和我坐一会吗
Do you have time to sit with me?

438
00:17:37,372 --> 00:17:40,140
不知道 我的表在你那儿
I don't know. You're wearing my watch.

439
00:17:43,417 --> 00:17:46,119
陶艺 现在你迷上陶艺了
Pottery. Now you're making pottery.

440
00:17:46,139 --> 00:17:48,022
我需要一个花瓶
I needed a new vase...

441
00:17:48,036 --> 00:17:49,936
和几个盘子
and some plates.

442
00:17:49,951 --> 00:17:51,217
以及几个碗
And bowls.

443
00:17:51,227 --> 00:17:53,644
好吧 我的瓷器柜子设计得不好
The china cabinet I built had some design flaws.

444
00:17:53,662 --> 00:17:56,413
为什么你不把这改成一间客房
Why don't you just turn this into a guest room?

445
00:17:56,433 --> 00:17:57,799
客房
A guest room?

446
00:17:57,811 --> 00:17:59,844
你的意思是一间等待着
You mean a room ready and waiting

447
00:17:59,859 --> 00:18:01,191
不属于这的人的房间
for someone who isn't there?

448
00:18:01,202 --> 00:18:04,421
还是一间提醒我还是单身的房间
A room devoted to reminding me that I'm still alone?

449
00:18:04,444 --> 00:18:07,862
不 我不需要那样
Yeah, I don't need that.

450
00:18:07,887 --> 00:18:12,723
泰德 无论你放多少东西到这个房间
Ted, no matter how many things you put in this room...

451
00:18:12,757 --> 00:18:15,024
我都在这儿
I'll still be here.

452
00:18:26,728 --> 00:18:27,394
嗨
Hey.

453
00:18:27,400 --> 00:18:29,584
嗨
Hey!

454
00:18:30,087 --> 00:18:31,471
请进吧
Come on in.

455
00:18:31,482 --> 00:18:33,448
谢了
Thanks.

456
00:18:34,571 --> 00:18:37,005
噢 额 谢谢你帮我打包我余下的东西
Oh, um, thanks for packing up the rest of my stuff.

457
00:18:37,023 --> 00:18:39,357
小意思 额你想喝点儿咖啡么
No problem. Uh, you want some coffee?

458
00:18:39,375 --> 00:18:41,709
-额 当然 -是呵 -是的
Uh, sure. Yeah? Yeah.

459
00:18:43,068 --> 00:18:44,185
那啥 最近怎么样呀
So, how are things?

460
00:18:44,195 --> 00:18:46,162
-挺好的 你呢 -我好的不得了
Good! You? Great!

461
00:18:46,177 --> 00:18:48,160
你知道么 这杯子是我亲手做的
You know, I actually made this mug.

462
00:18:48,175 --> 00:18:49,741
哦 是么 噢 天哪
Oh, yeah? Oh! Yeah. Oh!

463
00:18:49,753 --> 00:18:52,421
噢 不好意思 咖啡太浓烈了
Yeah, sorry, coffee's a little strong.

464
00:18:53,564 --> 00:18:56,116
在马修和莉莉那住的怎么样呀
How was your stay with Marshall and Lily?

465
00:18:56,135 --> 00:18:58,168
额 有点儿怪怪的
Uh... A little weird.

466
00:18:58,184 --> 00:19:00,318
其实他们不喜欢长岛
They're not loving Long Island.

467
00:19:00,334 --> 00:19:01,500
喔
Oh.

468
00:19:01,509 --> 00:19:03,041
我想他们心底还是意识到
I think deep down, they realize

469
00:19:03,054 --> 00:19:05,021
他们不适合那儿
it just... isn't a good fit.

470
00:19:05,036 --> 00:19:08,621
有时候要承认这一点很难
It's hard to admit that sometimes.

471
00:19:08,646 --> 00:19:10,513
确实
Sure is.

472
00:19:10,528 --> 00:19:13,829
不过我想最好还是要面对这些 继续自己的人生
But I guess it's better to face it and move on

473
00:19:13,853 --> 00:19:18,556
而不该强求那些本不属于自己的事物 对吧
than try to force something that just isn't meant to be, right?

474
00:19:18,589 --> 00:19:20,305
我也这么觉得
I think so.

475
00:19:20,816 --> 00:19:21,983
那么 你觉得你要怎样
So, what do you think

476
00:19:21,993 --> 00:19:23,543
来处理我原来的房间
you're gonna do with my old room?

477
00:19:23,555 --> 00:19:25,071
我还没完全想好
Haven't really thought about it.

478
00:19:25,083 --> 00:19:26,749
噢
Oh!

479
00:19:32,791 --> 00:19:35,025
谁稀罕曼哈顿啊
Who needs Manhattan?

480
00:19:35,041 --> 00:19:36,374
是啊
Yeah.

481
00:19:38,517 --> 00:19:40,517
恩 是泰德 他想知道
Hmm, it's Ted. He wants to know

482
00:19:40,533 --> 00:19:42,550
我们想不想去市里聚一聚
if we want to hang out in the city.

483
00:19:42,565 --> 00:19:44,432
下一班列车九分钟走
The next train leaves in nine minutes.

484
00:20:01,910 --> 00:20:05,663
亲爱的莉莉和马修 我不知道你们是否知道
Dear Lily and Marshall, I don't know if you know this,

485
00:20:05,690 --> 00:20:08,691
我从来没把你们的名字从租约上删掉
but I never took your names off the lease.

486
00:20:08,713 --> 00:20:12,415
而今天 我把我的名字删了
Well, today I took my name off it.

487
00:20:12,441 --> 00:20:15,442
这个公寓现在属于你们了
The apartment is now yours.

488
00:20:15,464 --> 00:20:18,298
我想我也找到
And I think I finally figured out the best thing

489
00:20:18,319 --> 00:20:20,286
处置罗宾房间的最好方法了
to do with Robin's old room.

490
00:20:29,201 --> 00:20:32,870
对我来说 这个地方已经有鬼影缠绕了
See, for me, this place has begun to feel a little haunted.

491
00:20:32,896 --> 00:20:35,480
开始 我以为我是被的罗宾缠绕着
At first, I thought it was haunted by Robin,

492
00:20:35,499 --> 00:20:38,367
但是现在 我觉得其实我是被自己缠绕着
but now I think it was haunted by me.

493
00:20:38,388 --> 00:20:43,441
直到有新生活开始 那些小鬼才能不闹腾了
Well, no ghost is at peace until it finally moves on.

494
00:20:44,702 --> 00:20:46,703
我需要改变
I need a change.

495
00:20:46,718 --> 00:20:48,751
而且我觉得你们也需要
And I think you do, too.

496
00:20:48,766 --> 00:20:51,433
这个公寓现在需要新生命
This apartment needs some new life.

497
00:20:51,453 --> 00:20:55,789
所以请把我们的旧家装扮成你俩的新家
So, please, make our old home your new home.

498
00:20:55,820 --> 00:20:58,337
它现在再也不会被幽灵缠绕了
It is now ghost-free.

499
00:20:58,355 --> 00:20:59,971
爱你们的 泰德
Love, Ted.
