Sheldon, time to go.

20
00:00:46,791 --> 00:00:48,638
We really need
to get one of these.

21
00:00:48,706 --> 00:00:50,742
What on earth do we need
a computer for?

22
00:00:50,853 --> 00:00:52,904
Yeah, we got you
and your big head.

23
00:00:52,972 --> 00:00:54,997
But we can get
so much accomplished.

24
00:00:55,065 --> 00:00:56,432
I could use
a spreadsheet program

00:00:56,518 --> 00:00:58,091
to keep track of your expenses.

26
00:00:58,178 --> 00:00:59,763
I do that in the back
of my checkbook.

27
00:00:59,831 --> 00:01:03,013
Yes, but does your checkbook
go "beep" when you open it?

00:01:03,412 --> 00:01:04,640
I don't think so.

00:01:04,708 --> 00:01:05,798
Plus, the computer

30
00:01:05,875 --> 00:01:07,243
can organize your recipes.

31
00:01:07,320 --> 00:01:09,130
But my recipes are organized.

It doesn't matter, Sheldon.

36
00:01:15,985 --> 00:01:17,247
We can't afford a computer.

37
00:01:17,346 --> 00:01:19,762
Sure we can. It's only $998,

38
00:01:19,944 --> 00:01:22,312
and Dave says we can buy it
on easy monthly payments.

39
00:01:22,428 --> 00:01:23,442
That's true.

40
00:01:23,510 --> 00:01:24,810
Stay out of this, Dave.

41
00:01:24,951 --> 00:01:25,969
Come on.

42
00:01:26,037 --> 00:01:27,263
We got to get home.

43
00:01:27,340 --> 00:01:29,247

- Sheldon, I said no.

44
00:01:29,432 --> 00:01:30,789

you're getting on my nerves.

47
00:01:35,016 --> 00:01:36,232
It's not fair.

48
00:01:36,300 --> 00:01:38,083
You bought Missy a Ring Pop.

49
00:01:38,154 --> 00:01:39,406
For ten cents.

50
00:01:39,474 --> 00:01:41,747
- And I'm worth every penny.
- Let's go.

51
00:01:42,049 --> 00:01:43,234
Sorry, Dave.

52
00:01:43,302 --> 00:01:44,881

00:02:26,474 --> 00:02:28,708
which starts with an "E"
and ends with a "T."

68
00:02:28,896 --> 00:02:30,232
Coincidence?

69
00:02:30,347 --> 00:02:31,583
I don't think so.

70
00:02:32,232 --> 00:02:34,279
You're gonna live
with us forever, aren't you?

71
00:02:34,647 --> 00:02:36,965
So, Sheldon wants
a computer?

72
00:02:37,033 --> 00:02:38,157
Ever since he could talk.

73
00:02:38,234 --> 00:02:39,437
But now more than ever.

74
00:02:39,505 --> 00:02:41,137
Well, he should get a job
after school.

75
00:02:41,214 --> 00:02:42,130
Save up and buy one.

76
00:02:42,198 --> 00:02:44,012
Get a job? He's nine.

77
00:02:44,073 --> 00:02:45,419
I mowed lawns
when I was his age.

78
00:02:45,487 --> 00:02:46,545
Made pretty good money.

79
00:02:46,613 --> 00:02:48,529
You want Sheldon
to mow lawns?

80
00:02:48,685 --> 00:02:50,716
He's so pale,
five minutes in the sun,

81
00:02:50,826 --> 00:02:52,060
he'd burst into flames.

82
00:02:52,138 --> 00:02:53,451
I would pay to see that.

83
00:02:53,519 --> 00:02:54,755
Shut up, Georgie.

84
00:02:55,050 --> 00:02:56,179
I hope you told him

85
00:02:56,247 --> 00:02:58,263
- we can't afford it.
- Of course.

86
00:02:58,742 --> 00:02:59,976
I could buy it for him,

87
00:03:00,044 --> 00:03:02,490
and then y'all could pay
me back when you can.

88
00:03:02,974 --> 00:03:04,982
Okay, Connie, now you're
just insulting me.

89
00:03:05,105 --> 00:03:06,930
Well, that was not my intention,

90
00:03:07,007 --> 00:03:08,454
but I'm glad to hear it.

91
00:03:08,531 --> 00:03:10,039
I can pay my own bills

92
00:03:10,107 --> 00:03:11,372
and take care of my family.

93
00:03:11,443 --> 00:03:13,726
There are expenses
we could cut back on

94
00:03:13,794 --> 00:03:15,255
so we could afford a computer.

95
00:03:15,372 --> 00:03:17,107
You mean like the money
you give to church?

96
00:03:17,208 --> 00:03:19,326
No, I mean like
the money you give

97
00:03:19,396 --> 00:03:21,021

98
00:03:21,089 --> 00:03:22,336
Good one, Mom.

99
00:03:22,404 --> 00:03:23,532
- Shut up. Shut up, pumpkin.
- Shut up.

100
00:03:23,599 --> 00:03:24,759
We're not getting a computer.

101
00:03:24,857 --> 00:03:26,787
We don't need your money.

102
00:03:27,529 --> 00:03:28,755
Where are you going?

103
00:03:29,028 --> 00:03:31,177

Why are you still up?

108
00:03:46,333 --> 00:03:49,028
Madame Curie is on the roof,

109
00:03:49,154 --> 00:03:51,833
and she's not wearing her hat.

110
00:03:52,099 --> 00:03:53,771
You're just dreaming, baby.

111
00:03:54,146 --> 00:03:56,818
But she'll be cold
without her hat.

112
00:03:56,886 --> 00:03:59,121
I'll give her mine.
Now you go to sleep.

113
00:03:59,525 --> 00:04:00,950
Mm, thanks, Mom.

114
00:04:01,042 --> 00:04:02,771
You're the best.

115
00:04:05,139 --> 00:04:06,774

116
00:04:21,636 --> 00:04:24,270

118
00:04:28,153 --> 00:04:30,850
Oh, come on.
You know how I feel

119
00:04:30,918 --> 00:04:32,660
about your mother meddlin'
in our finances.

120
00:04:32,738 --> 00:04:35,270
She wasn't meddlin',
she was offering to help.

121
00:04:35,384 --> 00:04:37,465
And that computer
is not some silly toy.

122
00:04:37,598 --> 00:04:39,422
Sheldon could use it
for his schoolwork,

123
00:04:39,499 --> 00:04:42,414
and I could use it to...
organize my recipes.

124
00:04:42,491 --> 00:04:44,535
You already got 'em organized
on those little cards.

125
00:04:44,603 --> 00:04:45,995
Yeah, like a cave person.

126
00:04:46,139 --> 00:04:47,848
Well, it doesn't matter.

127
00:04:48,129 --> 00:04:50,195
We can't afford it,
end of story.

128
00:04:50,629 --> 00:04:52,558
Not exactly end of story.

129
00:04:52,796 --> 00:04:53,920
What's that mean?

130
00:04:53,988 --> 00:04:56,067
I've been setting money aside
the last couple of years,

131
00:04:56,134 --> 00:04:57,980
and this might be a good use
for it.

132
00:04:58,746 --> 00:05:00,004
Money from what?

133
00:05:00,072 --> 00:05:01,847
You know, here and there.

134
00:05:02,347 --> 00:05:03,912
Bookkeeping for the church,

135
00:05:03,980 --> 00:05:05,834
some seamstress work,

136
00:05:05,902 --> 00:05:07,980
birthday money
from my Aunt Zelda.

137
00:05:08,065 --> 00:05:10,007
And just how much
of this "here and there" money

138
00:05:10,074 --> 00:05:11,110
you got saved up?

139
00:05:11,187 --> 00:05:12,881
Well, seeing as it's my money,

140
00:05:12,949 --> 00:05:14,605
I don't think
that's any of your business.

141
00:05:14,769 --> 00:05:16,148
None of my business?

142
00:05:16,551 --> 00:05:17,636
You see every nickel

143
00:05:17,704 --> 00:05:19,386

and you got secret money?

144
00:05:19,511 --> 00:05:21,261
It's not secret.
I just told you.

00:05:21,629 --> 00:05:22,918

146
00:05:23,480 --> 00:05:25,582
Well, now you're headed
into secret territory.

00:05:25,664 --> 00:05:27,496
Oh, okay.

00:06:43,156 --> 00:06:44,955
You know what,
I'll bring both.

182
00:06:46,100 --> 00:06:47,754
Should I pack my toothbrush

183
00:06:47,822 --> 00:06:49,986
or use the one
I keep at Meemaw's?

184
00:06:50,263 --> 00:06:51,554
I got this one.

185
00:06:51,642 --> 00:06:53,246
Nobody cares.

186
00:06:53,881 --> 00:06:55,330
I don't want
to go to Meemaw's house.

187
00:06:55,398 --> 00:06:56,979
What if that girl calls back?

188
00:06:57,047 --> 00:06:58,549
Fine, then stay here
with your father.

189
00:06:58,617 --> 00:07:01,297
Sheldon and Missy, we are out
of here in half an hour.

190
00:07:03,322 --> 00:07:06,064
Not a lot of time
to pick a toothbrush.

191
00:07:16,002 --> 00:07:17,166
Come on in.

192
00:07:17,299 --> 00:07:18,963
Mom and Dad need a break.

193
00:07:19,031 --> 00:07:21,088
We don't know how long.

194
00:07:22,528 --> 00:07:23,896
What's he got in there?

195
00:07:23,981 --> 00:07:25,405
Everything.

196
00:07:29,377 --> 00:07:32,353
First and ten in the
closing minutes of the fourth quarter...

197
00:07:32,721 --> 00:07:35,056
I ain't never
getting married.

198
00:07:35,376 --> 00:07:37,488
- That so?
- Yeah.

199
00:07:37,556 --> 00:07:39,908
Women are nothing but trouble.

200
00:07:40,199 --> 00:07:41,757
I'll get it!

201
00:07:42,144 --> 00:07:45,015
Hello, Georgie speaking.

202
00:07:45,090 --> 00:07:47,760
Did you run to the phone?
Do you feel stupid?

203
00:07:50,125 --> 00:07:51,515
Who was it?

204
00:07:51,600 --> 00:07:53,147
Nobody.

205
00:07:54,140 --> 00:07:55,205
This little tiff

206
00:07:55,273 --> 00:07:56,470
between your mom and me
will blow over.

207
00:07:56,537 --> 00:07:57,884
Don't make a big deal of it.

208
00:07:57,952 --> 00:07:59,213
I'm not. I'm just saying

209
00:07:59,281 --> 00:08:01,043
I'm better suited
to the single life.

210
00:08:01,367 --> 00:08:02,726
And how do you picture that?

211
00:08:02,794 --> 00:08:04,969
Okay, well, you know the buffet
at Golden Corral,

212
00:08:05,037 --> 00:08:06,188
where there's all kinds
of choices

213
00:08:06,255 --> 00:08:07,688
and you can have
as much as you want?

214
00:08:07,755 --> 00:08:08,820
Yeah.

215
00:08:08,888 --> 00:08:11,734
It'll be like that,
only with hot girls.

216
00:08:12,625 --> 00:08:14,242
Georgie, I'll bet you
a thousand dollars

217
00:08:14,310 --> 00:08:16,219
you're married before you're 25.

218
00:08:16,937 --> 00:08:18,416
You got a bet.

219
00:08:18,695 --> 00:08:19,719
I feel like

220
00:08:19,787 --> 00:08:21,562
I'm stealing your money.

221
00:08:22,672 --> 00:08:26,250
<i>Georgie married
his first wife at 19.</i>

222
00:08:27,562 --> 00:08:29,555
<i>He never paid my father.</i>

223
00:08:30,062 --> 00:08:33,070
Well, I got to tell you
how happy I am

224
00:08:33,211 --> 00:08:35,726
that y'all are spending
the night with me.

225
00:08:35,813 --> 00:08:38,081
Your house smells
like cigarettes.

226
00:08:38,149 --> 00:08:39,221
So happy.

227
00:08:39,289 --> 00:08:40,703
Sheldon, we've
talked about this.

228
00:08:40,771 --> 00:08:43,047
You don't need to announce
to people how things smell.

229
00:08:43,115 --> 00:08:44,162
Hmm.

230
00:08:44,230 --> 00:08:45,523
All right, you two,
settle in.

231
00:08:45,591 --> 00:08:48,094
Are you and Dad
gonna get a divorce?

232
00:08:48,162 --> 00:08:49,418
Of course not.

233
00:08:49,486 --> 00:08:51,300
Are you sure?
Packing up your kids

234
00:08:51,368 --> 00:08:53,501
in the middle of the night
and moving in with your mom

235
00:08:53,569 --> 00:08:55,497
has all the earmarks
of a divorce.

236
00:08:55,596 --> 00:08:57,390
We're not getting a divorce.

237
00:08:57,576 --> 00:08:58,953
Okay, go to sleep.

238
00:08:59,036 --> 00:09:00,726
Sweet dreams.

239
00:09:08,560 --> 00:09:11,817
I can't believe Mom and Dad
had a fight over beer.

240
00:09:12,294 --> 00:09:14,405
I don't think
the fight was about beer.

241
00:09:14,482 --> 00:09:16,434
I think there was
more subtext.

242
00:09:16,575 --> 00:09:18,114
You're probably right.

243
00:09:18,402 --> 00:09:21,645
Then again,
I don't know what subtext is.

244
00:09:24,897 --> 00:09:26,654
I don't want to get
in your business,

245
00:09:26,722 --> 00:09:28,187
but since you're
getting in my bed,

246
00:09:28,255 --> 00:09:30,683
- I'm getting in your business.
- Go ahead.

247
00:09:30,997 --> 00:09:32,534
When you leaving?

248
00:09:32,645 --> 00:09:34,208
Very funny.

249
00:09:34,276 --> 00:09:35,834
That wasn't a joke.

250
00:09:35,953 --> 00:09:37,845
I love you, and
I love the kids,

251
00:09:37,913 --> 00:09:39,895
but I love you better
living across the street.

252
00:09:39,972 --> 00:09:43,036
Sorry the end of my marriage
is inconveniencing you.

253
00:09:43,104 --> 00:09:44,495
Oh, don't be so dramatic.

254
00:09:44,563 --> 00:09:45,677
It's a little spat.

255
00:09:45,745 --> 00:09:47,934
No, this was
a long time coming.

256
00:09:48,059 --> 00:09:50,911
This goes to the very core
of our relationship.

257
00:09:51,161 --> 00:09:52,911
I see we're sticking
with dramatic.

258
00:09:52,988 --> 00:09:55,505
The minute he found out
I had money set aside,

259
00:09:55,638 --> 00:09:57,292
he felt threatened.
And you know why?

260
00:09:57,369 --> 00:09:59,731
'Cause it meant that I can
live independent of him.

261
00:09:59,866 --> 00:10:01,591
Sleeping in your
mommy's bed?

262
00:10:01,659 --> 00:10:03,116
You know what I mean.

263
00:10:05,219 --> 00:10:07,321
You gonna buy Sheldon
that computer?

264
00:10:07,423 --> 00:10:09,481
Well, now I have to.

265
00:10:09,549 --> 00:10:11,122
Got it.

266
00:10:20,450 --> 00:10:23,450
You do know I still have
an active love life.

267
00:10:23,662 --> 00:10:25,403
Just go to sleep.

268
00:10:30,484 --> 00:10:32,028
On this very bed.

269
00:10:32,096 --> 00:10:33,692
Oh, Mom.

270
00:10:39,622 --> 00:10:41,046
What's for breakfast?

271
00:10:41,294 --> 00:10:42,996
I don't know.
Grab a bowl of cereal.

272
00:10:43,122 --> 00:10:45,107
Mom usually makes us
eggs and toast

273
00:10:45,184 --> 00:10:46,464
and the occasional meat.

274
00:10:46,541 --> 00:10:48,043
Well, Mom isn't here, is she?

275
00:10:48,216 --> 00:10:51,653
Whoa. Somebody woke up
on the wrong side of the bed.

276
00:10:52,005 --> 00:10:54,161
And you had a choice
'cause you had the whole bed.

277
00:10:54,270 --> 00:10:55,355
Georgie.

278
00:10:55,513 --> 00:10:56,833
Walking on thin ice.

279
00:10:57,263 --> 00:10:59,872
Maybe you should go across
the street and apologize.

280
00:11:00,833 --> 00:11:02,052
I can't do that.

281
00:11:02,379 --> 00:11:03,520
Why not?

282
00:11:03,747 --> 00:11:05,770
'Cause if I do,
it sets a bad precedent.

283
00:11:05,838 --> 00:11:07,506
What's Nixon got to do with it?

284
00:11:07,583 --> 00:11:08,671
What?

285
00:11:08,739 --> 00:11:11,669
You said "bad president,"
like Nixon.

286
00:11:11,737 --> 00:11:13,606
You know, this guy.

287
00:11:17,483 --> 00:11:19,309
You going to apologize?

288
00:11:20,354 --> 00:11:21,645
Dad!

289
00:11:21,713 --> 00:11:23,036
Dad!

290
00:11:23,849 --> 00:11:26,091
If you are,
bring back meat!

291
00:11:32,770 --> 00:11:33,828
Hey.

292
00:11:34,294 --> 00:11:35,692
I hope you're happy.

293
00:11:36,094 --> 00:11:38,138
Thank you, Georgie.
That's very kind.

294
00:11:38,322 --> 00:11:39,927
Mom and Dad are fighting
because you want

295
00:11:39,995 --> 00:11:41,708
to get a stupid computer.

296
00:11:42,090 --> 00:11:43,489
What are you talking about?

297
00:11:43,557 --> 00:11:44,708
Mom wanted
to buy it for you,

298
00:11:44,776 --> 00:11:46,051
Dad said they couldn't
afford it,

299
00:11:46,119 --> 00:11:47,317
Meemaw offered
to pay for it,

300
00:11:47,385 --> 00:11:49,231
and now I'm eating
pineapple spears for lunch.

301
00:11:49,316 --> 00:11:51,364
I hate making
my own lunch.

302
00:11:51,432 --> 00:11:53,122
I'm sorry, Georgie,
I didn't know.

303
00:11:53,190 --> 00:11:54,724
Yeah, well,
now you do.

304
00:11:54,792 --> 00:11:55,989
What did you get?

305
00:11:56,057 --> 00:11:58,544
A turkey sandwich Mom cut
in the shape of a heart,

306
00:11:58,612 --> 00:11:59,942
a fruit cup, a brownie,

307
00:12:00,010 --> 00:12:02,809
and a note from Meemaw saying
how much she loves me.

308
00:12:03,330 --> 00:12:05,770
I haven't read it yet,
but I bet it's a lot.

309
00:12:05,869 --> 00:12:08,317
I don't even have
a can opener.

310
00:12:10,334 --> 00:12:13,419
Oh, Sugar Apple,
I love you so much.

311
00:12:13,549 --> 00:12:16,481
Your affection for
inanimate objects frightens me.

312
00:12:16,549 --> 00:12:18,247
I'm glad you're happy,
Missy.

313
00:12:18,315 --> 00:12:21,770
I'm even happier that I got
a toy, and Sheldon got nothin'.

314
00:12:21,838 --> 00:12:23,362
Well, now, we're not exactly

315
00:12:23,430 --> 00:12:24,430
done shopping.

316
00:12:24,525 --> 00:12:27,364
Sheldon,
you still want that computer?

317
00:12:27,661 --> 00:12:29,325
I thought we couldn't
afford it.

318
00:12:29,393 --> 00:12:30,724
Don't you worry about that.

319
00:12:30,792 --> 00:12:32,483
Do you want it or not?

320
00:12:32,697 --> 00:12:34,059
More than anything.

321
00:12:34,127 --> 00:12:36,458
All right, then,
let's go get it.

322
00:12:36,904 --> 00:12:40,427
Wait. He gets a computer
and I get a lousy toy?

323
00:12:40,495 --> 00:12:42,022
I thought you liked it.

324
00:12:42,090 --> 00:12:43,989
Not anymore.

325
00:12:48,530 --> 00:12:50,398
Where's the water come out of?

326
00:12:50,522 --> 00:12:52,927
Well, seeing as that's
the dryer, nowhere.

327
00:12:53,588 --> 00:12:54,779
Hmm.

328
00:12:55,659 --> 00:12:57,099
So this one's the washer?

329
00:12:57,179 --> 00:12:58,559
No foolin' you.

330
00:12:58,887 --> 00:13:00,139
What are you doing?

331
00:13:00,207 --> 00:13:02,341
Separating the whites
from the colors.

332
00:13:02,409 --> 00:13:03,890
Whoa, that's racist.

333
00:13:04,589 --> 00:13:06,824
How did I get a rocket scientist
for one son

334
00:13:06,892 --> 00:13:09,138
- and a rodeo clown for the other?
- Oh, man.

335
00:13:09,376 --> 00:13:11,903
I'd give anything
to be a rodeo clown.

336
00:13:12,395 --> 00:13:13,664
They make
people happy,

337
00:13:13,741 --> 00:13:15,866
and they see the rodeo for free.

338
00:13:17,061 --> 00:13:18,552
Mmm.

339
00:13:24,231 --> 00:13:27,020
<i>The home
computer I had long coveted</i>

340
00:13:27,088 --> 00:13:29,622
<i>was finally in my possession,</i>

341
00:13:29,756 --> 00:13:33,224
<i>but it was also destroying
my home.</i>

342
00:13:33,598 --> 00:13:35,329
<i>Thankfully, it came pre-loaded</i>

343
00:13:35,397 --> 00:13:38,356
<i>with a program to help solve
personal problems.</i>

344
00:13:38,888 --> 00:13:41,169
Hello, I am Eliza.

345
00:13:41,379 --> 00:13:44,817
My... parents...

346
00:13:45,075 --> 00:13:48,367
are... fighting...

347
00:13:48,435 --> 00:13:50,477
a lot.

348
00:13:51,051 --> 00:13:53,656
I see.
Can you elaborate on that?

349
00:13:53,772 --> 00:13:56,133
My mother...

350
00:13:56,316 --> 00:13:59,648
bought... me...

351
00:13:59,739 --> 00:14:01,547
this...

352
00:14:01,701 --> 00:14:04,836
computer...

353
00:14:05,249 --> 00:14:06,669
but...

354
00:14:06,810 --> 00:14:11,523
my dad... says... we can't...

355
00:14:11,803 --> 00:14:14,891
afford it.

356
00:14:15,750 --> 00:14:17,961
Do you have issues
with your mother?

357
00:14:18,122 --> 00:14:20,403
Mmm...
No.

358
00:14:20,694 --> 00:14:23,969

Hello, I am Eliza.

366
00:14:46,084 --> 00:14:48,898
The future might be overrated.

367
00:14:51,150 --> 00:14:52,651
Okay, water's
definitely on.

368
00:14:52,719 --> 00:14:55,313
- Try it now.
- We want delicate or regular?

369
00:14:56,117 --> 00:14:57,836
It doesn't
matter, just turn it on.

370
00:14:58,071 --> 00:15:00,930
Let's go with
delicate to be safe.

371
00:15:02,226 --> 00:15:03,859
Nothin'.

372
00:15:03,965 --> 00:15:05,358

What?

375
00:15:08,092 --> 00:15:10,227
Go across the street
and apologize to Mom.

376
00:15:10,852 --> 00:15:12,586
I got nothin' to apologize for.

377
00:15:12,654 --> 00:15:14,899
You don't have to mean it.
I never do.

378
00:15:14,967 --> 00:15:16,570
Georgie, just mind
your business.

379
00:15:16,638 --> 00:15:17,961
Okay, sorry.

380
00:15:18,143 --> 00:15:19,541
In case you
were wondering,

381
00:15:19,609 --> 00:15:20,891
I didn't mean that.

382
00:15:20,968 --> 00:15:22,893
See how easy it is?

383
00:15:24,695 --> 00:15:27,288
These home computers
are amazing.

384
00:15:27,365 --> 00:15:29,188
I could start a real
bookkeeping business

385
00:15:29,256 --> 00:15:30,315
with that thing.

386
00:15:30,383 --> 00:15:32,219

long way to giving you

What did it say?

394
00:15:46,930 --> 00:15:48,601
It said...

395
00:15:48,906 --> 00:15:51,188

the garage.

399

You think I should apologize
to George?

400
00:15:57,004 --> 00:15:59,605
Well, of course not. That would
set a terrible precedent.
