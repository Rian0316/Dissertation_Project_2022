1
00:00:01,050 --> 00:00:02,040
Once upon a time,

2
00:00:02,040 --> 00:00:03,890
there was a majestic king,

3
00:00:04,970 --> 00:00:06,700
who lived with his noble brother

4
00:00:07,140 --> 00:00:10,930
in a colorful kingdom where
music and art were celebrated.

5
00:00:11,510 --> 00:00:13,650
The king did not foresee having a child,

6
00:00:14,230 --> 00:00:16,420
but he lived in an enchanted land

7
00:00:16,800 --> 00:00:18,530
where all things were possible.

8
00:00:19,320 --> 00:00:23,550
In time, he was blessed with
a beautiful baby daughter

9
00:00:24,120 --> 00:00:27,420
for whom he wished only
peace and happiness.

10
00:00:31,020 --> 00:00:34,030
Still, the king had demons who pursued him.

11
00:00:34,860 --> 00:00:36,970
There was a ruthless
beast who wanted to take

12
00:00:36,970 --> 00:00:38,350
the kingdom for her own.

13
00:00:38,820 --> 00:00:41,480
Armed with a pack of untamed creatures,

14
00:00:41,650 --> 00:00:44,200
She drove the other magical
beings from the land,

15
00:00:44,760 --> 00:00:48,440
And there was a wicked sorceress
with enchanted stones

16
00:00:48,450 --> 00:00:50,670
that weakened the king on every full moon.

17
00:00:52,430 --> 00:00:55,480
Seeing the shadow his
enemies cast upon his home,

18
00:00:56,140 --> 00:00:58,960
the king was driven to send
his beloved princess away,

19
00:00:59,920 --> 00:01:01,600
convincing all who remained

20
00:01:02,180 --> 00:01:03,700
that she was forever lost.

21
00:01:07,310 --> 00:01:10,610
The king, in his sorrow,
turned away from the world.

22
00:01:11,640 --> 00:01:15,080
The castle closed its doors,
and the kingdom fell.

23
00:01:16,870 --> 00:01:19,880
Some say that the only light
that shines in the castle

24
00:01:19,880 --> 00:01:22,440
Illuminates the shadow
of the once mighty king

25
00:01:22,440 --> 00:01:24,460
in the room meant for his child,

26
00:01:25,510 --> 00:01:27,740
But as the ruthless beasts took rule

27
00:01:27,740 --> 00:01:29,820
over the falling king's realm,

28
00:01:30,960 --> 00:01:33,410
little did they know
that he and his brother

29
00:01:33,620 --> 00:01:36,770
would not rest until their
enemies were vanquished...

30
00:01:39,450 --> 00:01:41,570
For they believed that one day

31
00:01:42,080 --> 00:01:44,870
they would heal their kingdom
and bring their princess home

32
00:01:46,590 --> 00:01:51,100
so that she might live happily ever after.

33
00:01:58,400 --> 00:02:00,620
Authentic cast-iron columns.

34
00:02:02,130 --> 00:02:03,220
Look at that.

35
00:02:04,220 --> 00:02:05,730
The original bloomery forge

36
00:02:05,920 --> 00:02:07,500
fueled by a charcoal furnace.

37
00:02:12,350 --> 00:02:14,520
The modern elements blend
very nicely indeed.

38
00:02:15,390 --> 00:02:16,850
My foundation has aligned itself

39
00:02:16,850 --> 00:02:18,730
with the city's historical
preservation society.

40
00:02:18,730 --> 00:02:20,350
We have a vested interest in...

41
00:02:21,360 --> 00:02:22,590
seeing this building protected.

42
00:02:22,590 --> 00:02:25,060
Place is a dump. The Guerrera family

43
00:02:25,060 --> 00:02:26,860
would be doing the city a favor.

44
00:02:29,730 --> 00:02:30,940
Well, unfortunately,

45
00:02:30,940 --> 00:02:32,970
Under the preservation act of 1966,

46
00:02:32,970 --> 00:02:34,780
we cannot allow the Guerreras to demolish

47
00:02:34,780 --> 00:02:36,580
one of the city's original foundries,

48
00:02:36,580 --> 00:02:38,410
even if it is for something as noble

49
00:02:38,640 --> 00:02:39,850
and distinguished

50
00:02:40,720 --> 00:02:41,630
as a casino.

51
00:02:43,680 --> 00:02:44,730
So thank you, gentlemen,

52
00:02:45,080 --> 00:02:46,670
And do give my best to Francesca.

53
00:03:12,490 --> 00:03:14,910
I suppose we shall have to
call this your white period.

54
00:03:15,060 --> 00:03:17,350
I'm missing a crucial color in my palette,

55
00:03:17,640 --> 00:03:19,220
That of my enemy's blood.

56
00:03:19,220 --> 00:03:21,460
Well, I recommend a venetian
red with a dash of rust.

57
00:03:21,460 --> 00:03:22,740
It's been months!

58
00:03:22,880 --> 00:03:24,020
I've adhered to our plan--

59
00:03:24,020 --> 00:03:26,780
Sit and do nothing, sell our grief,

60
00:03:27,070 --> 00:03:29,070
and now my child is safely away,

61
00:03:29,330 --> 00:03:31,470
and another full moon is upon us,

62
00:03:31,570 --> 00:03:33,710
another night of pathetic weakness

63
00:03:33,710 --> 00:03:36,030
as the moonlight rings steal my strength.

64
00:03:39,270 --> 00:03:40,660
The inertia is killing me.

65
00:03:41,310 --> 00:03:43,260
I need to act. I-I need--

66
00:03:43,330 --> 00:03:44,790
I need to spill blood.

67
00:03:45,410 --> 00:03:48,050
Well, then you'll be pleased to know

68
00:03:48,240 --> 00:03:50,280
that I've located the last of the 12 rings

69
00:03:50,280 --> 00:03:51,890
forged with your blood.

70
00:03:53,550 --> 00:03:54,340
Then it's time.

71
00:03:54,340 --> 00:03:55,540
And none too soon.

72
00:03:55,540 --> 00:03:57,120
I'm concerned about Hayley.

73
00:03:59,330 --> 00:04:00,310
She looks well enough.

74
00:04:00,320 --> 00:04:01,960
She looks no better than you, brother.

75
00:04:02,120 --> 00:04:03,420
Now if the two of you
would treat each other

76
00:04:03,420 --> 00:04:05,670
as more than just passing acquaintances--

77
00:04:05,670 --> 00:04:07,320
She has you to help her.

78
00:04:09,920 --> 00:04:10,850
Sadly...

79
00:04:12,020 --> 00:04:13,980
Like the father of her child,

80
00:04:14,020 --> 00:04:16,190
she prefers to fight her demons alone.

81
00:05:42,990 --> 00:05:43,960
What's the hurry?

82
00:05:44,260 --> 00:05:45,550
I have to get back to campus,

83
00:05:45,550 --> 00:05:46,790
meet my new advisor.

84
00:05:46,790 --> 00:05:48,890
Apparently the one I was
supposed to have dropped dead.

85
00:05:48,890 --> 00:05:51,550
Guy did triathlons yet couldn't
climb a flight of stairs.

86
00:05:51,550 --> 00:05:52,650
Will I see you later?

87
00:05:53,850 --> 00:05:55,180
Marcel, you know the deal.

88
00:05:55,810 --> 00:05:58,150
No strings, no plans.

89
00:05:58,390 --> 00:05:59,660
I know, I know.

90
00:05:59,880 --> 00:06:02,080
Just feeling nostalgic, I guess.

91
00:06:04,270 --> 00:06:05,910
You're not missing anything over there.

92
00:06:06,270 --> 00:06:08,510
That bitch Francesca's got her
werewolves on every corner,

93
00:06:08,510 --> 00:06:10,290
and as usual, the humans
in the known don't care

94
00:06:10,290 --> 00:06:12,360
as long as tourism money
keeps rolling through.

95
00:06:12,810 --> 00:06:15,130
Yeah. Got to say, never thought I'd see

96
00:06:15,130 --> 00:06:17,580
the day the vampires were
kicked out of the quarter.

97
00:06:17,850 --> 00:06:19,530
And I never thought I'd
be sleeping with one,

98
00:06:19,530 --> 00:06:22,030
So I guess life is full of surprises.

99
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:32,110
How's klaus?

100
00:06:33,950 --> 00:06:35,080
Nobody knows.

101
00:06:35,480 --> 00:06:36,480
Not even you?

102
00:06:37,320 --> 00:06:38,490
Not even me.

103
00:06:38,910 --> 00:06:40,320
It doesn't make sense.

104
00:06:40,580 --> 00:06:42,170
The wolves attacked him in his home,

105
00:06:42,350 --> 00:06:44,450
took his town, probably killed his kid.

106
00:06:44,660 --> 00:06:46,090
Why hasn't he struck back?

107
00:06:47,100 --> 00:06:48,060
He's in mourning.

108
00:06:48,060 --> 00:06:50,180
No, no. If anyone can mourn and murder

109
00:06:50,180 --> 00:06:51,490
at the same time, it's him.

110
00:06:51,960 --> 00:06:52,970
Something's up.

111
00:06:53,610 --> 00:06:54,840
Just wish I knew what.

112
00:06:58,460 --> 00:06:59,540
I saw Davina.

113
00:07:00,340 --> 00:07:01,470
She's doing well.

114
00:07:01,640 --> 00:07:02,980
She's back in high school.

115
00:07:03,070 --> 00:07:05,110
She told her whole witch coven to shove it.

116
00:07:05,950 --> 00:07:06,710
Good.

117
00:07:08,020 --> 00:07:08,830
Good girl.

118
00:07:13,890 --> 00:07:15,040
Maybe it's better.

119
00:07:16,280 --> 00:07:17,570
Just move forward

120
00:07:18,240 --> 00:07:20,720
instead of holding on to
things we can't change.

121
00:07:23,670 --> 00:07:24,420
Yeah.

122
00:07:26,140 --> 00:07:26,850
Maybe.

123
00:07:35,600 --> 00:07:36,560
Here you go, Davina.

124
00:07:37,250 --> 00:07:39,010
Now sometime, you're gonna
have to give me the lowdown

125
00:07:39,010 --> 00:07:42,610
on why you're so hooked on
ancient icelandic folk music.

126
00:07:42,850 --> 00:07:44,020
It's for someone else.

127
00:07:44,020 --> 00:07:45,240
I sure hope so.

128
00:07:58,290 --> 00:07:59,310
Hey there, cutie.

129
00:07:59,370 --> 00:08:00,640
Don't call me that.

130
00:08:01,060 --> 00:08:03,950
So I heard that you ditched your coven.

131
00:08:04,380 --> 00:08:05,300
That's too bad.

132
00:08:05,310 --> 00:08:07,070
That other harvest girl Cassie,

133
00:08:07,210 --> 00:08:09,650
she has been superhelpful

134
00:08:09,650 --> 00:08:10,640
to all us wolves.

135
00:08:10,640 --> 00:08:12,710
She's making you moonlight rings, Oliver.

136
00:08:12,950 --> 00:08:13,860
I wouldn't call that helpful.

137
00:08:13,860 --> 00:08:15,350
I'd call that an alliance.

138
00:08:16,430 --> 00:08:17,480
Well, you can call it whatever you want.

139
00:08:17,480 --> 00:08:18,740
As long as we don't have to turn

140
00:08:18,740 --> 00:08:20,530
in the full moon anymore,
it works for me...

141
00:08:21,700 --> 00:08:22,440
But look.

142
00:08:23,520 --> 00:08:25,080
I'd take off if I were you.

143
00:08:25,430 --> 00:08:27,080
Things are about to get
a little ugly in here.

144
00:08:28,520 --> 00:08:29,980
Hey, y'all. Store's closed.

145
00:08:29,980 --> 00:08:31,300
- What's going on? - No way!

146
00:08:31,300 --> 00:08:32,530
Get out now!

147
00:08:33,430 --> 00:08:35,030
Hey. What are you doing?

148
00:08:35,720 --> 00:08:36,930
It's Joe Dalton, right?

149
00:08:37,810 --> 00:08:39,700
You see, I've been
studying up on this store.

150
00:08:40,190 --> 00:08:43,680
It's be a stable for the
quarter for 90 years.

151
00:08:44,580 --> 00:08:46,320
It was run by you, your daddy,

152
00:08:46,320 --> 00:08:48,120
and then his daddy before him.

153
00:08:48,870 --> 00:08:49,680
That's right.

154
00:08:50,030 --> 00:08:51,560
Yeah. You see, the thing is, Joe,

155
00:08:52,260 --> 00:08:54,150
There just ain't many photos

156
00:08:54,460 --> 00:08:55,920
of anyone in your family

157
00:08:57,910 --> 00:08:58,780
but you.

158
00:08:59,240 --> 00:09:00,340
Oliver, no!

159
00:09:01,510 --> 00:09:03,450
Stop! Stop it! Stop it!

160
00:09:08,300 --> 00:09:09,630
Joe, get out of here.

161
00:09:15,990 --> 00:09:17,490
We have a deal, Cassie.

162
00:09:17,690 --> 00:09:18,760
Witches don't get in our way

163
00:09:18,760 --> 00:09:20,610
when it comes to killing vampires

164
00:09:20,610 --> 00:09:21,840
who enter the quarter.

165
00:09:21,840 --> 00:09:23,710
Davina's not in our coven anymore.

166
00:09:24,070 --> 00:09:25,190
The rules don't apply to her.

167
00:09:25,190 --> 00:09:26,670
Well, make them apply.

168
00:09:28,060 --> 00:09:29,880
Get everyone out of my face.

169
00:09:30,070 --> 00:09:31,300
They're here hovering all the time.

170
00:09:31,300 --> 00:09:32,310
They're just doing their job.

171
00:09:32,310 --> 00:09:33,420
Their job is to protect me

172
00:09:33,420 --> 00:09:34,530
from Klaus Mikaelson,

173
00:09:34,530 --> 00:09:36,860
who by the way has not set
foot outside his house

174
00:09:36,860 --> 00:09:38,040
in months!

175
00:09:38,390 --> 00:09:40,900
All this waiting, I'm losing my mind.

176
00:09:42,460 --> 00:09:44,760
Anyone who is not paid to protect me, go.

177
00:09:44,760 --> 00:09:45,770
Get out!

178
00:09:55,700 --> 00:09:59,190
She's unraveling. Poor thing.

179
00:09:59,890 --> 00:10:01,750
Cracking under the pressure.

180
00:10:02,100 --> 00:10:05,410
I assume that was Elijah and
Niklaus' goal all along.

181
00:10:06,170 --> 00:10:09,250
Say what you will, they are
impressive strategists.

182
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:11,880
Trait they inherited from you, dear mother.

183
00:10:11,890 --> 00:10:13,680
I suppose they did, Finn.

184
00:10:14,850 --> 00:10:17,690
Francesca Guerrera will be her own undoing.

185
00:10:18,160 --> 00:10:20,310
Let's see how impressive your brothers are

186
00:10:20,610 --> 00:10:22,510
when they finally come up against me.

187
00:10:47,210 --> 00:10:49,230
It never gets old for you guys, does it?

188
00:10:49,340 --> 00:10:51,020
Like a couple of dogs with a bone.

189
00:10:51,080 --> 00:10:53,430
Tell Francesca I'm just
trying to live a normal life.

190
00:10:53,680 --> 00:10:56,460
See if you can get that through
her thick canine skull.

191
00:10:59,120 --> 00:11:00,130
Why do I bother?

192
00:11:00,130 --> 00:11:03,590
Here. You're regular, extra sugar, right?

193
00:11:17,020 --> 00:11:17,810
Hello?

194
00:11:22,830 --> 00:11:23,730
Klaus?

195
00:11:38,550 --> 00:11:39,430
Klaus?

196
00:12:03,210 --> 00:12:04,610
Klaus, I know you're here somewhere.

197
00:12:04,610 --> 00:12:05,860
We need to talk.

198
00:12:06,980 --> 00:12:08,500
He doesn't wish to see you.

199
00:12:08,570 --> 00:12:10,870
Ohh! Elijah.

200
00:12:12,310 --> 00:12:13,630
Where the hell did you come from?

201
00:12:13,860 --> 00:12:14,980
I beg your pardon.

202
00:12:15,730 --> 00:12:17,770
Aren't you the one who is trespassing?

203
00:12:18,650 --> 00:12:20,740
He doesn't care much for
conversation these days,

204
00:12:20,740 --> 00:12:21,930
And he certainly wouldn't care for the fact

205
00:12:21,930 --> 00:12:23,930
that you put yourself in
danger by coming here.

206
00:12:23,930 --> 00:12:25,270
I'm already in danger.

207
00:12:25,270 --> 00:12:27,600
I have Guerreras following
me like it's a police state.

208
00:12:27,600 --> 00:12:28,800
The city's being run by gangsters,

209
00:12:28,800 --> 00:12:30,530
and you guys aren't doing
anything about it.

210
00:12:30,530 --> 00:12:31,870
Marcel took them out a hundred years ago

211
00:12:31,870 --> 00:12:32,540
without any of you.

212
00:12:32,540 --> 00:12:34,550
Don't you think he might be
up for lending you a hand?

213
00:12:36,550 --> 00:12:38,060
Thank you for coming, Camille.

214
00:12:47,060 --> 00:12:48,670
I know your family is grieving,

215
00:12:49,370 --> 00:12:50,680
but I know you don't believe those rumors

216
00:12:50,680 --> 00:12:52,220
that Marcel killed the baby.

217
00:12:52,480 --> 00:12:54,400
So if you want help taking
down the Guerreras,

218
00:12:54,480 --> 00:12:55,320
you have a weapon across the river

219
00:12:55,320 --> 00:12:56,860
just waiting to be fired.

220
00:12:58,370 --> 00:12:59,240
Use it.

221
00:13:11,280 --> 00:13:12,670
I like her spirit.

222
00:13:16,780 --> 00:13:17,830
So do I.

223
00:13:29,370 --> 00:13:30,760
Dude, come on. This is, like,

224
00:13:30,760 --> 00:13:32,510
the 20th group I've brought you.

225
00:13:33,010 --> 00:13:34,740
There's got to be a
keeper in here somewhere.

226
00:13:36,790 --> 00:13:38,150
I'll be the judge of that.

227
00:13:42,450 --> 00:13:44,330
I know you're all wondering
how you got here.

228
00:13:44,800 --> 00:13:46,260
Don't worry about that for now.

229
00:13:46,310 --> 00:13:49,540
Instead, I want you to
think about your lives.

230
00:13:52,850 --> 00:13:54,010
Don't be afraid.

231
00:13:56,690 --> 00:13:58,150
Remember when you were a kid

232
00:13:58,150 --> 00:14:00,010
and you felt like anything was possible,

233
00:14:00,430 --> 00:14:01,470
And then you grew up,

234
00:14:01,610 --> 00:14:03,480
and things didn't turn
out like you planned.

235
00:14:03,600 --> 00:14:07,090
But still there was that part
inside of you that would dream.

236
00:14:07,200 --> 00:14:08,770
Maybe you wanted strength,

237
00:14:08,820 --> 00:14:10,700
Maybe you wanted to be a part of something,

238
00:14:10,700 --> 00:14:12,770
something bigger than yourselves.

239
00:14:13,550 --> 00:14:15,660
Maybe you wanted to be a fighter,

240
00:14:16,190 --> 00:14:17,980
have something worth fighting for.

241
00:14:18,550 --> 00:14:21,710
Maybe some of you even
wanted to live forever.

242
00:14:21,730 --> 00:14:24,650
Well, you can have it, all of it,

243
00:14:25,010 --> 00:14:27,640
Because that's what being
a vampire's all about.

244
00:14:28,840 --> 00:14:30,230
Don't be afraid.

245
00:14:30,670 --> 00:14:33,950
What do you have to fear
when you can do this?

246
00:14:38,330 --> 00:14:39,240
I know.

247
00:14:39,430 --> 00:14:40,480
Pretty cool, right?

248
00:14:41,050 --> 00:14:43,380
When you leave here, you'll forget this,

249
00:14:43,490 --> 00:14:44,680
but somewhere deep down,

250
00:14:44,690 --> 00:14:47,620
you'll know that the offer
still exists to join me.

251
00:14:48,120 --> 00:14:49,290
Be like me.

252
00:14:49,430 --> 00:14:51,940
And only then will you
find your way back here

253
00:14:51,990 --> 00:14:53,280
because you want it,

254
00:14:53,680 --> 00:14:55,290
because you need it.

255
00:14:57,400 --> 00:14:58,650
My money's on the rocker chick.

256
00:14:58,650 --> 00:14:59,720
I wouldn't bet on it.

257
00:14:59,720 --> 00:15:01,700
Be lucky to get one from that group.

258
00:15:01,700 --> 00:15:03,190
How can you tell?

259
00:15:03,190 --> 00:15:04,260
They all seem tough.

260
00:15:04,260 --> 00:15:05,710
What are you looking for?

261
00:15:05,880 --> 00:15:07,640
I'm not looking for tough guys, Josh.

262
00:15:07,640 --> 00:15:09,240
I'm looking for warriors.

263
00:15:09,600 --> 00:15:10,540
What's the difference?

264
00:15:10,540 --> 00:15:13,020
A warrior fights for what they believe in.

265
00:15:16,550 --> 00:15:20,210
A warrior fights for his family.

266
00:15:52,730 --> 00:15:54,200
What do you think you're doing, Elijah?

267
00:15:54,200 --> 00:15:55,260
Welcome back.

268
00:15:55,270 --> 00:15:56,590
What is it, the third night this week?

269
00:15:56,590 --> 00:15:57,980
I don't need a caretaker.

270
00:15:57,990 --> 00:16:00,260
Hybrids are invincible, right?

271
00:16:00,260 --> 00:16:01,760
What are you doing, Elijah?

272
00:16:01,760 --> 00:16:04,520
As we have discussed, our
illusion needs to be flawless.

273
00:16:04,520 --> 00:16:05,820
Now months have passed.

274
00:16:05,820 --> 00:16:06,950
It's the appropriate time.

275
00:16:06,950 --> 00:16:09,050
What's next on the appropriate list,

276
00:16:09,050 --> 00:16:10,800
Klaus and I hold our heads up high

277
00:16:10,800 --> 00:16:12,300
and say we're ready to try again?

278
00:16:12,300 --> 00:16:14,150
I understand that this
is difficult for you.

279
00:16:14,150 --> 00:16:16,030
What's difficult is knowing that

280
00:16:16,030 --> 00:16:17,940
Francesca Guerrera is still breathing

281
00:16:17,940 --> 00:16:19,170
after she was the one that plotted

282
00:16:19,170 --> 00:16:20,580
with the witches to kill my baby.

283
00:16:20,580 --> 00:16:22,170
You will have your vengeance,

284
00:16:22,170 --> 00:16:24,060
I promise you this.

285
00:16:25,850 --> 00:16:29,170
Well, until then, this is my room,

286
00:16:30,580 --> 00:16:32,160
And I'll tell you when it's appropriate

287
00:16:32,160 --> 00:16:33,590
to clean it out.

288
00:17:02,800 --> 00:17:04,760
I don't know why you keep showing off.

289
00:17:04,760 --> 00:17:06,040
You know you can't hurt me.

290
00:17:06,040 --> 00:17:08,850
Oh, but the desire I have to do so.

291
00:17:11,410 --> 00:17:12,930
I am Mikael,

292
00:17:13,340 --> 00:17:15,840
the vampire who hunts vampires.

293
00:17:15,840 --> 00:17:19,170
You know thin human blood
does little to sustain me.

294
00:17:19,180 --> 00:17:20,240
Feed.

295
00:17:29,630 --> 00:17:30,650
Stop.

296
00:17:39,000 --> 00:17:41,080
I wish I could rip this from you

297
00:17:41,380 --> 00:17:43,680
and break that which binds me to you

298
00:17:43,680 --> 00:17:46,890
And complete the task for
which you resurrected me--

299
00:17:47,020 --> 00:17:49,870
Kill the bastard who calls himself my son.

300
00:17:50,240 --> 00:17:51,690
You can't take off the bracelet,

301
00:17:51,690 --> 00:17:53,110
and you can't kill Klaus,

302
00:17:53,110 --> 00:17:53,860
not until I figure out

303
00:17:53,860 --> 00:17:56,270
how to save my friends from dying, too.

304
00:18:02,560 --> 00:18:04,510
I've studied their mother's
spell book for weeks.

305
00:18:04,510 --> 00:18:05,620
I'm getting close.

306
00:18:05,620 --> 00:18:08,710
Once I unlink my friends
from Klaus' sire line,

307
00:18:08,710 --> 00:18:10,220
I will unleash you to be the monster

308
00:18:10,220 --> 00:18:12,320
that you are so eager to be.

309
00:18:12,890 --> 00:18:15,860
Music to my ears, my little witch.

310
00:18:16,350 --> 00:18:17,990
The wolves have the numbers.

311
00:18:17,990 --> 00:18:21,150
Back in 1925, the Guerrera
pack was may 100.

312
00:18:21,150 --> 00:18:22,570
We went Guerrilla warfare on their asses

313
00:18:22,570 --> 00:18:24,850
and wiped them out over a 4-day fight,

314
00:18:25,370 --> 00:18:27,970
but we're not just talking
about Guerreras now.

315
00:18:27,970 --> 00:18:30,440
They've had wolves coming
in from packs all over.

316
00:18:31,190 --> 00:18:32,900
Well, we don't need to hit them all,

317
00:18:32,900 --> 00:18:34,080
just the 12 with the rings

318
00:18:34,080 --> 00:18:35,720
that take me out very full moon.

319
00:18:35,730 --> 00:18:37,400
What, you want to find 12 rings?

320
00:18:37,400 --> 00:18:38,990
Go out and chop off the hand of every wolf

321
00:18:38,990 --> 00:18:40,330
you find until you get what you want.

322
00:18:40,330 --> 00:18:42,290
I mean, come on. You taught me that.

323
00:18:42,480 --> 00:18:44,210
You and Elijah are stalling.

324
00:18:44,210 --> 00:18:45,160
Why?

325
00:18:47,140 --> 00:18:49,290
Because it's possible they're in possession

326
00:18:49,290 --> 00:18:51,660
of something very dangerous to us.

327
00:18:54,340 --> 00:18:56,300
Yeah. The stake that can kill you.

328
00:18:57,260 --> 00:18:58,600
It went missing

329
00:18:59,050 --> 00:19:01,220
the night I lost my child.

330
00:19:03,030 --> 00:19:06,050
So it's in play,

331
00:19:06,050 --> 00:19:08,320
and the thought of that
makes me very nervous,

332
00:19:08,320 --> 00:19:10,380
especially on nights like tonight.

333
00:19:14,330 --> 00:19:15,750
Why would you tell me that?

334
00:19:15,850 --> 00:19:17,110
Depends.

335
00:19:17,490 --> 00:19:18,680
Do you have it?

336
00:19:18,680 --> 00:19:19,530
Of course not.

337
00:19:19,530 --> 00:19:21,390
That kind of weapon does me no good.

338
00:19:21,390 --> 00:19:22,900
You die, I die

339
00:19:23,040 --> 00:19:25,630
Along with every vampire we've ever sired.

340
00:19:26,120 --> 00:19:30,380
Well, then perhaps, you'd
like to help me get it back.

341
00:19:31,390 --> 00:19:33,080
We attack the wolves tonight

342
00:19:33,080 --> 00:19:35,240
when the moon hits its apex.

343
00:19:36,020 --> 00:19:38,110
They won't expect it while I'm weak.

344
00:19:39,300 --> 00:19:41,960
Hey. Bad news or good news?

345
00:19:42,980 --> 00:19:44,110
Klaus, Joe.

346
00:19:44,110 --> 00:19:45,300
Joe, Klaus.

347
00:19:45,300 --> 00:19:47,100
Now you want to talk Guerreras,

348
00:19:47,190 --> 00:19:50,540
nobody fought harder back
in 1925 than Joe here.

349
00:19:50,550 --> 00:19:53,210
Fought so hard, he retired into retail.

350
00:19:53,210 --> 00:19:54,570
Been keeping the peace ever since

351
00:19:54,570 --> 00:19:56,270
and living right under their noses.

352
00:19:56,270 --> 00:19:59,680
Yeah. Well, good news is your
order came in this morning.

353
00:20:00,070 --> 00:20:02,360
The bad news, I got made.

354
00:20:02,360 --> 00:20:03,740
Your friend Davina saved my ass,

355
00:20:03,750 --> 00:20:05,330
but what's done is done,

356
00:20:05,480 --> 00:20:07,330
so pour me a drink, play me a song

357
00:20:07,330 --> 00:20:08,990
because it's gonna be my last.

358
00:20:08,990 --> 00:20:11,300
Joe, don't be dramatic.

359
00:20:11,460 --> 00:20:13,180
Just head out of town
till things blow over.

360
00:20:13,180 --> 00:20:15,590
No way. I don't run from Guerreras.

361
00:20:15,590 --> 00:20:16,960
You don't leave, you won't have to.

362
00:20:16,960 --> 00:20:18,270
They'll sniff you out in a day.

363
00:20:18,270 --> 00:20:20,120
You let them come hunt me down

364
00:20:20,360 --> 00:20:21,850
because I've had a good ride.

365
00:20:23,410 --> 00:20:27,470
How would you like to get
back in the fight, Joe?

366
00:20:35,090 --> 00:20:36,420
So what do you have in mind?

367
00:20:36,940 --> 00:20:39,270
I've been thinking about this
whole thing the wrong way.

368
00:20:41,690 --> 00:20:44,390
Guerrera pack loves to hunt.

369
00:20:44,920 --> 00:20:46,990
They're primal, alphas.

370
00:20:46,990 --> 00:20:48,140
I gave you my reason

371
00:20:48,140 --> 00:20:50,390
for not making a move
these past few months.

372
00:20:50,400 --> 00:20:53,460
What, pray tell, is theirs?

373
00:20:56,680 --> 00:20:58,210
They don't have the stake.

374
00:21:00,390 --> 00:21:01,960
Well, then who the hell does?

375
00:21:02,340 --> 00:21:04,130
Tonight, it doesn't matter.

376
00:21:04,640 --> 00:21:06,260
Because tonight

377
00:21:07,550 --> 00:21:09,520
we're going on a wolf hunt.

378
00:21:17,210 --> 00:21:19,010
We have the Guerreras where we want them,

379
00:21:19,010 --> 00:21:20,400
we have them waiting, we have them worried,

380
00:21:20,400 --> 00:21:21,440
and now we know they're an army

381
00:21:21,440 --> 00:21:23,030
with no defenses against an original.

382
00:21:23,040 --> 00:21:24,520
We don't know that for certain.

383
00:21:24,520 --> 00:21:25,440
I'm willing to gamble.

384
00:21:25,440 --> 00:21:26,630
It's too risky.

385
00:21:26,630 --> 00:21:27,880
The stake didn't just disappear.

386
00:21:27,880 --> 00:21:28,550
Someone has it.

387
00:21:28,550 --> 00:21:29,930
One enemy at a time.

388
00:21:29,930 --> 00:21:31,900
In the end, we'll slay them all.

389
00:21:38,480 --> 00:21:41,840
Tonight, we just have to
plant the right seeds,

390
00:21:41,840 --> 00:21:43,800
and for that, we need help.

391
00:21:54,100 --> 00:21:55,320
You know, I am starting to think

392
00:21:55,320 --> 00:21:57,350
that you have a death wish.

393
00:21:57,350 --> 00:21:59,050
Look. I just want to get my stuff

394
00:21:59,050 --> 00:22:00,200
and get out of town.

395
00:22:02,300 --> 00:22:03,910
And why would we let you do that?

396
00:22:05,230 --> 00:22:06,510
Because I got information

397
00:22:06,510 --> 00:22:09,420
that could be very useful
to Francesca Guerrera.

398
00:22:10,110 --> 00:22:11,850
We're taking the 12 original rings.

399
00:22:11,850 --> 00:22:14,370
Now 4 of them sit on the hands
of the Guerrera brothers,

400
00:22:14,370 --> 00:22:16,110
One on Oliver, one on Francesca,

401
00:22:16,110 --> 00:22:17,410
3 with her home security detail,

402
00:22:17,410 --> 00:22:19,080
and the rest scattered amongst her lackeys.

403
00:22:19,080 --> 00:22:21,430
Now each ring is distinguishable
by its setting--

404
00:22:21,440 --> 00:22:23,820
Gauche like those that wear them.

405
00:22:24,380 --> 00:22:26,630
Klaus thinks you have the white oak stake.

406
00:22:26,630 --> 00:22:27,900
But we don't.

407
00:22:27,910 --> 00:22:29,270
That doesn't matter

408
00:22:29,360 --> 00:22:31,180
because if they think you have it

409
00:22:31,180 --> 00:22:32,910
it means they don't know where it is.

410
00:22:32,910 --> 00:22:33,930
Do a spell.

411
00:22:33,930 --> 00:22:35,470
Find it now.

412
00:22:35,470 --> 00:22:37,280
If they believe they can get
their hands on the stake,

413
00:22:37,280 --> 00:22:39,190
they will come for it when I am weak.

414
00:22:39,190 --> 00:22:41,820
Each ring we retrieve will strengthen me,

415
00:22:41,820 --> 00:22:43,740
but I will still be at a disadvantage.

416
00:22:43,740 --> 00:22:45,030
Ergo any hope of our success

417
00:22:45,030 --> 00:22:47,860
depends entirely upon our working together.

418
00:22:47,880 --> 00:22:49,450
The two of you can no
longer afford to retreat

419
00:22:49,450 --> 00:22:50,920
to separate corners.

420
00:23:01,070 --> 00:23:02,540
This is our fight.

421
00:23:03,840 --> 00:23:05,850
Are you ready for battle, Hayley?

422
00:23:07,390 --> 00:23:08,730
Just promise me that Francesca

423
00:23:08,730 --> 00:23:10,760
doesn't come out of this alive.

424
00:23:13,440 --> 00:23:16,290
Her head will be delivered
to you on a silver platter,

425
00:23:17,400 --> 00:23:19,030
little wolf.

426
00:23:21,550 --> 00:23:23,340
I'll deal with the last
piece of the puzzle.

427
00:23:23,580 --> 00:23:25,450
L'arme filium.

428
00:23:25,450 --> 00:23:27,690
Pa kenbe ex oculus.

429
00:23:27,690 --> 00:23:28,650
Indi--

430
00:23:30,250 --> 00:23:32,330
It's no good. I can't find it.

431
00:23:32,340 --> 00:23:33,930
It must be cloaked.

432
00:23:34,030 --> 00:23:35,850
I'd love to know by whom.

433
00:23:38,170 --> 00:23:39,210
I'm afraid you'll have to tell us

434
00:23:39,210 --> 00:23:40,700
the whole story this time,

435
00:23:40,700 --> 00:23:42,910
not just enough to keep yourself alive.

436
00:23:42,910 --> 00:23:43,990
Francesca, I told you that--

437
00:23:43,990 --> 00:23:45,480
And I'm telling you

438
00:23:45,480 --> 00:23:47,200
give me something I don't already know,

439
00:23:47,200 --> 00:23:48,940
or you die right now.

440
00:23:49,000 --> 00:23:51,880
Spill, and you walk out that door.

441
00:23:53,550 --> 00:23:55,330
Who has the white oak stake?

442
00:23:56,930 --> 00:23:58,320
Rumor has it

443
00:23:58,770 --> 00:24:01,610
it landed in the hands of the priest.

444
00:24:02,420 --> 00:24:03,930
It's not enough I can't even go on a walk.

445
00:24:03,930 --> 00:24:05,090
Now you have to do this?

446
00:24:05,090 --> 00:24:06,870
You know how to stop this.

447
00:24:08,850 --> 00:24:10,220
Where's the stake?

448
00:24:11,480 --> 00:24:13,790
Fine. Whatever.

449
00:24:14,700 --> 00:24:15,690
What do I care?

450
00:24:15,690 --> 00:24:17,320
This is not even my fight.

451
00:24:18,760 --> 00:24:19,680
There.

452
00:24:20,090 --> 00:24:21,530
That's where you'll find what you want.

453
00:24:21,530 --> 00:24:23,410
Now all you need is my uncle's key.

454
00:24:23,730 --> 00:24:24,890
And where's that?

455
00:24:30,280 --> 00:24:32,280
Hiding in plain sight, genius.

456
00:25:08,590 --> 00:25:10,110
Klaus will be at his lowest strength

457
00:25:10,110 --> 00:25:12,230
for the next few hours.

458
00:25:12,230 --> 00:25:14,260
Once you retrieve the white oak stake,

459
00:25:14,260 --> 00:25:15,730
be ready to use it.

460
00:25:16,780 --> 00:25:18,040
You take a group to the compound

461
00:25:18,040 --> 00:25:20,580
and subdue him while he's still weak.

462
00:25:20,600 --> 00:25:21,740
What about Elijah and Hayley?

463
00:25:21,740 --> 00:25:23,330
There's no way they leave his side tonight.

464
00:25:23,330 --> 00:25:25,260
Elijah can be weakened by your bites.

465
00:25:25,270 --> 00:25:26,560
As for Hayley,

466
00:25:26,560 --> 00:25:29,620
whoever rips out her heart gets a bonus.

467
00:25:32,430 --> 00:25:33,480
And where will you be?

468
00:25:33,490 --> 00:25:35,510
Here, where it's safe.

469
00:25:35,510 --> 00:25:36,940
They're vampires.

470
00:25:36,940 --> 00:25:37,980
They can't get into the house

471
00:25:37,980 --> 00:25:39,190
without an invitation.

472
00:25:39,190 --> 00:25:41,070
So we risk our lives while you hide?

473
00:25:41,070 --> 00:25:42,720
I am the top dog.

474
00:25:42,830 --> 00:25:45,530
Your job is to ensure the
battle doesn't come to me.

475
00:25:50,030 --> 00:25:51,600
Start from the corners.

476
00:25:51,710 --> 00:25:53,670
Work the room from the outside in.

477
00:26:00,150 --> 00:26:01,470
Look what we have here.

478
00:26:07,370 --> 00:26:09,080
I know your boss wanted to buy this place,

479
00:26:09,080 --> 00:26:11,380
But I've been stockpiling
wolfs bane for months,

480
00:26:11,380 --> 00:26:14,920
And I just really needed
a place to store it.

481
00:26:20,410 --> 00:26:22,420
Get back! Get back!

482
00:26:24,550 --> 00:26:26,000
I'm gonna need that.

483
00:27:55,340 --> 00:27:56,350
Good evening.

484
00:28:05,050 --> 00:28:08,480
Have I mentioned that I've had
a rotten couple of months?

485
00:28:33,100 --> 00:28:35,010
You think you're strong because
of that ring you wear?

486
00:28:35,010 --> 00:28:36,570
You're nothing. We were strong.

487
00:28:36,570 --> 00:28:37,620
We were part of a pack,

488
00:28:37,620 --> 00:28:39,060
and you ruined it.

489
00:28:45,350 --> 00:28:47,360
If I see you with one of these again,

490
00:28:47,360 --> 00:28:49,360
I will kill you myself.

491
00:29:14,540 --> 00:29:15,700
It's fine.

492
00:29:16,360 --> 00:29:17,730
He can't come in.

493
00:29:18,120 --> 00:29:19,310
Can't I?

494
00:29:20,260 --> 00:29:21,630
Don't bluff me.

495
00:29:22,010 --> 00:29:23,230
You can't win.

496
00:29:23,580 --> 00:29:26,350
You mobsters all suffer from such hubris.

497
00:29:27,270 --> 00:29:31,040
Do you know al capone thought
himself invincible back in his day,

498
00:29:31,570 --> 00:29:33,080
And in the end,

499
00:29:33,420 --> 00:29:35,150
he was sentenced to the wretched filth

500
00:29:35,150 --> 00:29:38,950
of Alcatraz for which of his atrocities?

501
00:29:39,420 --> 00:29:40,520
Anyone?

502
00:29:40,900 --> 00:29:42,980
A failure to pay his taxes.

503
00:29:42,980 --> 00:29:45,230
I suppose the devil's in
the details, isn't it?

504
00:29:47,080 --> 00:29:50,140
My, my, you have a beautiful home here.

505
00:29:50,870 --> 00:29:53,040
I was so pleased when the city

506
00:29:53,040 --> 00:29:56,140
took my suggestion to
protect its heritage status

507
00:29:56,210 --> 00:29:58,140
and invoke eminent domain.

508
00:29:59,000 --> 00:30:01,970
So I suppose that means

509
00:30:01,980 --> 00:30:04,340
this house now belongs to the public,

510
00:30:04,340 --> 00:30:06,830
and as such, anyone can enter...

511
00:30:09,140 --> 00:30:11,200
without invitation.

512
00:30:33,430 --> 00:30:35,400
I'm still not at full strength.

513
00:30:36,900 --> 00:30:38,840
Which of the rings are unaccounted for?

514
00:30:38,840 --> 00:30:39,960
Only one.

515
00:30:40,970 --> 00:30:44,030
I must say the brothers fought valiantly

516
00:30:44,030 --> 00:30:46,070
before Miss Guerrera escaped.

517
00:30:47,940 --> 00:30:49,390
You let her get away.

518
00:30:50,670 --> 00:30:52,010
Not exactly.

519
00:31:24,140 --> 00:31:25,170
Marcel.

520
00:31:25,940 --> 00:31:27,260
They got Joe.

521
00:31:29,860 --> 00:31:32,170
Joe knew what he was getting himself into.

522
00:31:33,550 --> 00:31:35,620
So what? "Hey. Come on. Join our team.

523
00:31:35,620 --> 00:31:37,510
Your reward will be your death"?

524
00:31:40,800 --> 00:31:42,610
Here's what you got to understand.

525
00:31:42,660 --> 00:31:44,060
Vamps like Joe,

526
00:31:44,060 --> 00:31:45,890
they know what it feels
like to be in the battle

527
00:31:45,930 --> 00:31:47,920
and what it is to sit on the sidelines.

528
00:31:47,920 --> 00:31:50,020
Joe sat it out for a long time,

529
00:31:50,020 --> 00:31:52,340
but when the fight came
to him, he got back in

530
00:31:52,340 --> 00:31:54,880
because he'd rather die on his
feet than live on his knees.

531
00:31:54,880 --> 00:31:56,220
That's a warrior.

532
00:31:57,480 --> 00:31:59,150
But what are we fighting for?

533
00:31:59,150 --> 00:32:01,410
Me--I'm fighting for my home,

534
00:32:01,950 --> 00:32:04,630
for the dignity of the vampires
who were run out of there.

535
00:32:05,350 --> 00:32:10,010
The question is what are you fighting for?

536
00:32:12,820 --> 00:32:14,200
That's the problem.

537
00:32:14,200 --> 00:32:15,650
I have no idea.

538
00:32:15,650 --> 00:32:17,000
Look. The werewolves took over the quarter.

539
00:32:17,000 --> 00:32:17,910
We beat them back today,

540
00:32:17,910 --> 00:32:19,080
they'll fight us back tomorrow.

541
00:32:19,080 --> 00:32:20,120
It's nuts!

542
00:32:20,120 --> 00:32:23,030
And all for a few measly
blocks of real estate?

543
00:32:26,170 --> 00:32:29,300
I was born here in a time
far more shameful than now,

544
00:32:29,300 --> 00:32:31,580
and even then, this city
was worth fighting for.

545
00:32:31,580 --> 00:32:34,350
My blood runs through the
gutters of this city

546
00:32:34,350 --> 00:32:36,530
along with the blood of my closest friends,

547
00:32:36,530 --> 00:32:38,390
and, yeah, Klaus and I fought side by side

548
00:32:38,390 --> 00:32:40,190
against the Guerreras, but,
you know, before long,

549
00:32:40,190 --> 00:32:42,310
he's gonna want to be king of the wolves.

550
00:32:42,340 --> 00:32:44,400
His blood runs deep here, too.

551
00:32:47,790 --> 00:32:48,900
You hear that?

552
00:32:51,190 --> 00:32:53,910
That is the first, last, and only album

553
00:32:53,910 --> 00:32:56,540
that my friend Thierry Vanchure ever made.

554
00:32:56,920 --> 00:32:58,750
It could have only been made here.

555
00:33:00,180 --> 00:33:02,360
We're not fighting for real estate.

556
00:33:02,440 --> 00:33:04,610
We're fighting for the soul of this city.

557
00:33:06,220 --> 00:33:07,310
Hello?

558
00:33:11,100 --> 00:33:13,690
Hi. I'm sorry.

559
00:33:14,770 --> 00:33:16,030
This is weird.

560
00:33:16,540 --> 00:33:18,460
I just kind of found my way here.

561
00:33:27,350 --> 00:33:30,170
Hayley, Hayley! Hayley, please.

562
00:33:34,700 --> 00:33:35,920
I killed her.

563
00:33:40,570 --> 00:33:41,930
Francesca looked me in the eye

564
00:33:41,930 --> 00:33:45,380
and begged me for her life
as I tore her apart...

565
00:33:48,110 --> 00:33:50,110
But I don't feel better.

566
00:33:50,120 --> 00:33:53,480
I don't feel peace. I don't feel anything!

567
00:33:53,480 --> 00:33:54,930
It's perfectly natural given
what you've experienced.

568
00:33:54,930 --> 00:33:58,610
Nothing about what I am,
Elijah, is natural.

569
00:33:58,610 --> 00:34:00,730
As a hybrid, you will begin
to experience feelings

570
00:34:00,730 --> 00:34:02,150
with a greater intensity.

571
00:34:02,150 --> 00:34:04,230
It will take time to master control.

572
00:34:04,230 --> 00:34:07,940
I don't want to live like this, Elijah.

573
00:34:09,420 --> 00:34:10,910
I hate it.

574
00:34:13,940 --> 00:34:15,800
When I was living with the
crescents in the bayou,

575
00:34:15,800 --> 00:34:19,240
I finally understood the--the purity

576
00:34:19,320 --> 00:34:21,560
of being a wolf, the nobility.

577
00:34:24,220 --> 00:34:26,990
I killed 8 wolves tonight

578
00:34:27,000 --> 00:34:28,480
before I got to Francesca,

579
00:34:28,490 --> 00:34:31,450
8 of my own people.

580
00:34:32,490 --> 00:34:34,340
What's noble about that?

581
00:34:34,340 --> 00:34:36,900
I acted no better than a--

582
00:34:37,160 --> 00:34:38,720
Than a vampire.

583
00:34:45,400 --> 00:34:47,400
Everything has changed,

584
00:34:49,090 --> 00:34:50,600
And not just for me.

585
00:34:54,340 --> 00:34:56,940
I saw the way you looked at me before,

586
00:34:58,520 --> 00:35:00,810
and I see the way that you look at me now.

587
00:35:04,890 --> 00:35:07,900
I was a mother, and now I'm a monster.

588
00:35:12,220 --> 00:35:13,810
Things are different now.

589
00:35:15,570 --> 00:35:17,490
You can't tell me that they're not.

590
00:35:22,800 --> 00:35:23,840
Hayley.

591
00:35:42,680 --> 00:35:43,940
This sucks.

592
00:35:44,720 --> 00:35:46,050
No trades today.

593
00:35:46,710 --> 00:35:48,420
I mean, worse for you of course.

594
00:35:48,420 --> 00:35:50,310
Guy had the market cornered

595
00:35:50,310 --> 00:35:52,700
on the ancient icelandic folk scene.

596
00:35:53,980 --> 00:35:55,410
Those weren't for me.

597
00:35:56,460 --> 00:35:57,630
I'm Kaleb.

598
00:35:58,560 --> 00:35:59,750
Davina.

599
00:35:59,850 --> 00:36:00,980
Cool name.

600
00:36:01,160 --> 00:36:02,750
Terrible taste in music.

601
00:36:03,580 --> 00:36:04,840
You obviously need me.

602
00:36:07,820 --> 00:36:09,950
Could you not just take
a sledgehammer to them?

603
00:36:10,060 --> 00:36:11,880
These were forged by a witch, brother,

604
00:36:11,880 --> 00:36:15,570
and as such, only the elements of
water and fire can destroy them.

605
00:36:16,350 --> 00:36:18,300
I'd have thought this would
bring you greater pleasure.

606
00:36:18,850 --> 00:36:20,080
As would I.

607
00:36:22,570 --> 00:36:24,100
This was my fault,

608
00:36:26,050 --> 00:36:27,220
all of it.

609
00:36:29,030 --> 00:36:31,160
If had just accepted Hayley's pregnancy

610
00:36:31,160 --> 00:36:34,740
instead of playing king.

611
00:36:37,420 --> 00:36:39,120
I should have listened to you.

612
00:36:40,040 --> 00:36:44,770
Instead, my greed and my envy
robbed me of my daughter.

613
00:36:46,170 --> 00:36:49,660
My actions led to the release of a weapon

614
00:36:49,660 --> 00:36:52,180
that can kill not just me but you.

615
00:36:52,530 --> 00:36:53,240
A thousand years

616
00:36:53,240 --> 00:36:56,090
I've survived your attempts
to destroy me, brother.

617
00:37:00,610 --> 00:37:03,340
I imagine I can survive this.

618
00:37:05,370 --> 00:37:07,230
You chase my redemption

619
00:37:08,210 --> 00:37:11,210
like a man rolling a stone
up an endless mountain.

620
00:37:12,010 --> 00:37:13,930
Well, no mountain is endless, brother.

621
00:37:21,020 --> 00:37:23,090
Some are just steeper than others.

622
00:37:27,890 --> 00:37:29,040
And as much as I would like to be the one

623
00:37:29,040 --> 00:37:31,200
to comfort Hayley in this moment,

624
00:37:31,450 --> 00:37:34,650
I believe that only you
can understand her grief.

625
00:37:35,950 --> 00:37:37,860
We lost our child.

626
00:37:40,850 --> 00:37:44,120
I mean, what could I possibly
say to ease her pain?

627
00:37:48,210 --> 00:37:49,810
Whatever she needs to hear.

628
00:37:55,140 --> 00:37:57,480
Do you think things will be
better in the quarter now?

629
00:37:58,250 --> 00:38:01,950
No, but it as nice fighting
with Klaus for a change.

630
00:38:03,720 --> 00:38:05,510
I'm sorry about Joe.

631
00:38:06,060 --> 00:38:07,460
Guy was brave.

632
00:38:12,380 --> 00:38:13,630
So were you.

633
00:38:17,360 --> 00:38:18,610
Doesn't matter.

634
00:38:20,120 --> 00:38:23,500
This has to stop, Marcel, us.

635
00:38:23,560 --> 00:38:24,510
The deeper I'm in it with you,

636
00:38:24,510 --> 00:38:25,770
the deeper I'm into everything,

637
00:38:25,780 --> 00:38:27,710
and I have to get my certification,

638
00:38:27,710 --> 00:38:32,760
I have to help human people
with their human problems,

639
00:38:33,940 --> 00:38:37,500
and I can't do that if I keep
letting myself get pulled back in.

640
00:38:40,060 --> 00:38:41,970
I'm sorry. This has to end.

641
00:38:52,470 --> 00:38:53,950
It will get better.

642
00:38:54,230 --> 00:38:55,070
When?

643
00:38:57,130 --> 00:38:58,080
I'm immortal now.

644
00:38:58,080 --> 00:38:59,240
If I can't get through today,

645
00:38:59,240 --> 00:39:01,450
how am I supposed to get through forever?

646
00:39:06,790 --> 00:39:08,380
You know, over the years,

647
00:39:08,620 --> 00:39:12,420
I've had my share of friends, enemies,

648
00:39:12,880 --> 00:39:16,430
lovers, losses, and triumphs.

649
00:39:17,540 --> 00:39:20,340
With time, they all begin to run together,

650
00:39:22,850 --> 00:39:24,370
but you will find

651
00:39:25,190 --> 00:39:29,330
the real moments are vibrant.

652
00:39:34,170 --> 00:39:35,940
The rest just fades away.

653
00:39:38,220 --> 00:39:39,910
Your pain will fade.

654
00:39:40,810 --> 00:39:43,650
Not until I can hold my
baby in my arms again.

655
00:39:43,800 --> 00:39:45,410
And so you shall.

656
00:39:47,580 --> 00:39:49,350
But in order to do that,

657
00:39:49,350 --> 00:39:51,120
we need to regain control of the city.

658
00:39:52,380 --> 00:39:55,530
Now we worked separately
once to unite those wolves.

659
00:39:55,530 --> 00:39:57,630
We can work together to do it again.

660
00:39:57,970 --> 00:39:59,970
They don't need to be our enemies.

661
00:40:00,480 --> 00:40:01,570
After ambushing them,

662
00:40:01,570 --> 00:40:03,840
they're not gonna want to
be our friends, Klaus.

663
00:40:03,840 --> 00:40:07,360
You waged a just war on those
who would harm your child.

664
00:40:08,520 --> 00:40:09,910
Not only will they respect you.

665
00:40:09,910 --> 00:40:11,580
They will answer to you.

666
00:40:11,580 --> 00:40:13,170
Why would they do that now?

667
00:40:15,930 --> 00:40:17,500
Because you're their queen.

668
00:40:25,080 --> 00:40:26,890
What about all our other enemies?

669
00:40:27,380 --> 00:40:30,080
The witches don't stop plotting
even after they're dead.

670
00:40:30,190 --> 00:40:33,080
We defeated my mother and her witches

671
00:40:33,080 --> 00:40:35,640
because we stood united.

672
00:40:40,960 --> 00:40:43,830
That is how we will face all our enemies...

673
00:40:46,390 --> 00:40:47,790
As a family.

674
00:41:06,260 --> 00:41:08,220
Mr. Griffith? Cami.

675
00:41:08,220 --> 00:41:11,080
I can't thank you enough for
sponsoring my supervised residency.

676
00:41:11,080 --> 00:41:13,150
Please. Um, call me Vincent.

677
00:41:15,160 --> 00:41:16,440
Did she buy it?

678
00:41:16,810 --> 00:41:19,220
Entirely. The humans are weak.

679
00:41:19,560 --> 00:41:21,280
Their bodies are so strange.

680
00:41:21,680 --> 00:41:23,800
I've forgotten what it feels
like to be this vulnerable.

681
00:41:23,800 --> 00:41:26,430
At least you're not stuck
in the body of a teenager.

682
00:41:26,430 --> 00:41:28,590
Well, I love my body, mother.

683
00:41:29,190 --> 00:41:31,370
I'm pretty sure Davina Claire does, too.

684
00:41:31,370 --> 00:41:34,090
Don't be puerile. We have work to do.

685
00:41:34,680 --> 00:41:37,500
Your brothers did me a favor
by killing Francesca.

686
00:41:37,680 --> 00:41:41,010
Now I will control the
witches and the werewolves.

687
00:41:41,200 --> 00:41:42,910
With the vampires in exile,

688
00:41:42,910 --> 00:41:46,320
we can begin to take root in our new home.

689
00:41:47,270 --> 00:41:49,290
Finn, Kol,

690
00:41:50,730 --> 00:41:52,050
let's get to work.

691
00:41:52,610 --> 00:41:55,180
We have a family reunion to plan.
