weekend if you want to drop by.

175
00:08:13,869 --> 00:08:15,621
Yeah?

176
00:08:15,704 --> 00:08:18,081
Okay, I'll text you the details.

177
00:08:18,165 --> 00:08:20,167
Thanks. Bye.

178
00:08:21,168 --> 00:08:22,711
Maybe found a buyer for the car.

179
00:08:22,794 --> 00:08:24,880
Another one? Great.

180
00:08:24,963 --> 00:08:28,008
You could have sold that car
five times by now.

181
00:08:28,091 --> 00:08:30,177
- Coffee?
- Yup. [sighs]

182
00:08:30,260 --> 00:08:32,179
[Stephanie] The brakes are slow,

183
00:08:32,262 --> 00:08:34,932
so you're alert, predicting
things before they happen.

184
00:08:35,015 --> 00:08:37,768
The steering's rack-and-pinion,
the bushings are pretty worn,

185
00:08:37,851 --> 00:08:39,603
so it's basically
like driving a go-cart.

186
00:08:39,686 --> 00:08:42,397
I mean, you'd need
to get that fixed,

187
00:08:42,481 --> 00:08:45,025
if you do buy it, but, you know,
you probably won't.

188
00:08:45,108 --> 00:08:48,195
Well, you certainly know
your stuff, for a lady.

189
00:08:48,278 --> 00:08:50,697
Yeah, well, you'll need to get
your blood pressure checked

190
00:08:50,781 --> 00:08:52,991
'cause these cars were designed
for a much younger man.

191
00:08:53,075 --> 00:08:54,993
Apologies.

192
00:08:55,077 --> 00:08:58,705
Now, it's just that my wife and
my daughters have zero interest.

193
00:08:58,789 --> 00:09:00,874
Whereas my son and I,

194
00:09:00,958 --> 00:09:03,377
we'll tinker all afternoon,
every Sunday.

195
00:09:05,420 --> 00:09:07,839
My husband taught me everything
I know about this car.

196
00:09:07,923 --> 00:09:11,551
All right. He's a...
he's an enthusiast, too?

197
00:09:11,635 --> 00:09:14,471
- Him? No. My first husband.
- Oh.

198
00:09:14,554 --> 00:09:17,057
He bought this car
when he was a student.

199
00:09:17,140 --> 00:09:20,143
He saved every penny, worked
two jobs through college.

200
00:09:20,227 --> 00:09:22,938
He made sure I understood it
before he'd let me near it.

201
00:09:23,021 --> 00:09:25,315
- Or anyone.
- [chuckles]

202
00:09:25,399 --> 00:09:30,362
I mean, if you were to come down
to 4,700, we could have a deal.

203
00:09:30,445 --> 00:09:33,073
- What do you think?
- Really?

204
00:09:33,156 --> 00:09:35,450
[laughs] Look, are you sure
you want to sell this car?

205
00:09:35,534 --> 00:09:37,077
Yeah.

206
00:09:37,160 --> 00:09:39,371
[man on TV] What's this heap
of old iron doing here?

207
00:09:39,454 --> 00:09:42,332
- Old iron?
- I'll give you ten buck for it.

208
00:09:42,416 --> 00:09:44,918
Don't be daft.
This was once a great car.

209
00:09:45,002 --> 00:09:47,671

buying your car, Mommy?

210
00:09:47,754 --> 00:09:50,340
Oh, no, honey.
That's the mean junkyard man.

211
00:09:50,424 --> 00:09:52,151
The man buying the car
is actually pretty nice.

212
00:09:52,175 --> 00:09:53,802
Oh, thank God.

213
00:09:53,885 --> 00:09:55,804
You're selling your guys' Prius?

214
00:09:55,887 --> 00:09:58,724
Oh, no. Um...

215
00:09:58,807 --> 00:10:02,853
No, I'm actually thinking
about selling the Stag.

216
00:10:02,936 --> 00:10:04,730
It's falling to pieces.
I sent you...

217
00:10:04,813 --> 00:10:06,523
You're-you're selling Dad's car?

218
00:10:06,606 --> 00:10:08,293
Well, I wasn't going to
until I had talked to you.

219
00:10:08,317 --> 00:10:09,877
I mean, I'd keep it
for you if you want.

220
00:10:09,943 --> 00:10:12,696
It's just, it breaks down
every time I get in it.

221
00:10:12,779 --> 00:10:15,282
And I got to fork out thousands
to keep it on the road.

222
00:10:15,365 --> 00:10:17,200
You know?
And we don't have a garage.

223
00:10:17,284 --> 00:10:18,994
I guess.

224
00:10:19,077 --> 00:10:21,955
Love, are you okay
with that? Come on.

225
00:10:22,039 --> 00:10:24,082
I sent you a mail.
Uh, you obviously didn't get it.

226
00:10:24,166 --> 00:10:26,585
Fine. I love that car.

227
00:10:26,668 --> 00:10:28,670
But yeah, I completely get it.

228
00:10:28,754 --> 00:10:30,964
I don't want it
to fall apart in the street.

229
00:10:31,048 --> 00:10:32,090
Are you sure?

230
00:10:32,174 --> 00:10:34,593
Yeah.

231

[Niall] Now, bedtime, Missy!

232
00:10:37,804 --> 00:10:39,014
Hey, girl!

233
00:10:39,097 --> 00:10:40,849
- Hey, Niall.
- [Niall chuckles]

234
00:10:40,932 --> 00:10:42,726
Look at you two.
You little monkey.

235
00:10:42,809 --> 00:10:44,227
Place sucks without you.

236
00:10:44,311 --> 00:10:46,313

- [Niall] Which reminds me.

237
00:10:46,396 --> 00:10:48,690

What do you say? Good night.

- [Melissa] Good night.

240
00:10:52,944 --> 00:10:54,738
[Niall] Good night, Shannon.

241
00:10:54,821 --> 00:10:56,990

- I'll be up to read you

242

- You're grand.

243

- I have an episode
of The Crown to watch.
- Not you.

244

- That's sure to knock me out.
- Yeah.

He's making me sell it.

246
00:11:05,624 --> 00:11:08,168
No, he's right.
It's the grown-up thing to do.

247
00:11:08,251 --> 00:11:12,297
Dad told me never to attach
too much meaning to things.

What we all did in it
that matters.

Those memories are seared
into us forever.

251
00:11:19,012 --> 00:11:21,556
Yeah. I mean, you know...

'Cause the fella said
he was gonna get back to me.

254

He's got to run it by his wife.

255
00:11:26,812 --> 00:11:29,773
So it-it might not
even get sold.

256
00:11:29,856 --> 00:11:31,525
Well, I mean,
you don't fully understand,

257
00:11:31,608 --> 00:11:33,944
because it's 15 years until
we send Melissa to college.

258
00:11:34,027 --> 00:11:36,363
Yeah, but I can totally imagine
what you're going through.

259
00:11:36,446 --> 00:11:37,697
But-but Skyping every night

260
00:11:37,781 --> 00:11:39,533
and physically looking
at each other,

261
00:11:39,616 --> 00:11:41,743
it just makes
the separation harder.

262
00:11:41,827 --> 00:11:43,412
Phones were better.

263
00:11:43,495 --> 00:11:44,704
For all these advancements,

264
00:11:44,788 --> 00:11:46,581
the 21st century
just messes with things.

265
00:11:46,665 --> 00:11:48,750
Well, I spoke to my mom

266
00:11:48,834 --> 00:11:51,670
a handful of times
in four years of college.

267
00:11:51,753 --> 00:11:53,672
It was better.

268
00:11:53,755 --> 00:11:55,590
I don't know.

269
00:11:55,674 --> 00:11:57,717
Maybe she was privately bawling.

270

271

- Mm.

272

If I miss Melissa
one percent as much

273
00:12:03,348 --> 00:12:05,475

I'll be a wreck.
