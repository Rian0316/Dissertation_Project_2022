<i>每个人都沉浸在幸福中</i>
<i>Everyone was happy as can be.</i>

16
00:00:18,960 --> 00:00:22,020
<i>这就意味没什么好故事可以讲</i>
<i>Which means there are absolutely no good stories.</i>

17
00:00:22,020 --> 00:00:23,500
<i>我们直接跳到</i>
<i>Let's skip ahead...</i>

18
00:00:24,680 --> 00:00:26,760
<i>2012年10月</i>

21
00:00:31,520 --> 00:00:35,260
三天前

22
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:33,330
<i>这一切始于巴尼</i>

23
00:00:33,330 --> 00:00:35,660
<i>从同事那里得到一条友好的建议</i>
<i>a little friendly advice from a coworker.</i>

24
00:00:35,660 --> 00:00:36,580
定份婚前协议
Get a prenup,

25
00:00:36,580 --> 00:00:39,210
不然我就在她之前阉了你
or I'll neuter you before she ever has a chance!

26
00:00:39,220 --> 00:00:41,980
首先  你要是吃了洋葱圈
First of all, if you have an onion bagel,

27
00:00:41,980 --> 00:00:44,810
就不要再吃大葱奶油干酪了
you don't need scallion cream cheese.

28
00:00:46,920 --> 00:00:48,960
再说  昆茵是个好女孩
Secondly, Quinn is a great girl.

29
00:00:48,960 --> 00:00:50,160
我信任她
I trust her.

30
00:00:50,160 --> 00:00:52,030
达琳当初也是个好女孩
Oh, Darlene was a great girl.

31
00:00:52,030 --> 00:00:53,080
我也信任过她
I trusted her.

32
00:00:53,080 --> 00:00:54,980
可后来她夺走了一切
And then she took everything!

33
00:00:54,980 --> 00:00:57,190
我的房子  我的车
My house, my car...

34
00:00:57,480 --> 00:00:59,630
我的爱犬小拖船
my dog Tugboat.

35
00:00:59,850 --> 00:01:02,000
我甚至在孩子方面也输了
I even lost out with the kids.

36
00:01:02,010 --> 00:01:03,290
全部监护权
Full custody!

37
00:01:03,290 --> 00:01:06,390
我得到了孩子的全部监护权
I got full custody of those kids!

38
00:01:06,480 --> 00:01:08,030
你的孩子太可怕了
Your kids are horrible.

39
00:01:08,030 --> 00:01:09,070
简直是混世魔王
The worst.

40
00:01:09,070 --> 00:01:10,440
巴尼  我看着达琳
Barney, I watched as Darlene

41
00:01:10,440 --> 00:01:12,580
把我生活中美好的东西一一切除
cut everything good out of my life

42
00:01:12,590 --> 00:01:15,520
就像一个神经错乱的外科医生在切除器官
like a deranged surgeon hacking out organs,

43
00:01:15,520 --> 00:01:17,670
我说这话不是在比喻
and that's not a metaphor.

44
00:01:17,670 --> 00:01:20,170
她真的拿走了我的一颗肾
She got one of my kidneys.

45
00:01:21,780 --> 00:01:23,580
这是她的来电铃声
That's her ringtone.

46
00:01:24,320 --> 00:01:27,700
我已经一无所有了  达琳
I have nothing left to give you, Darlene!

47
00:01:43,230 --> 00:01:45,110
你们不会相信巴尼今天做了什么
You won't believe what Barney did today.

48
00:01:45,120 --> 00:01:47,900
你们不会相信昆茵今天做了什么
You won't believe what Quinn did today.

49
00:01:47,900 --> 00:01:49,490
可以去吃午饭了吗
Hey, you ready for lunch?

50
00:01:49,490 --> 00:01:50,860
她来了
Hey, there she is.

51
00:01:50,860 --> 00:01:53,840
未来的巴尼・斯丁森太太
The future Mrs. Barney Stinson.

52
00:01:53,840 --> 00:01:55,730
你最好珍惜一下签名还能
You better enjoy signing your name "Quinn Garvey"

53
00:01:55,740 --> 00:01:57,510
签"昆茵・加维"的最后时光
while you still can, right?

54
00:01:57,510 --> 00:01:59,570
不如这就签上
Like, I don't know...

55
00:01:59,740 --> 00:02:03,370
这里  这里  这里首字母大写
here, here, here, initial here...

56
00:02:03,370 --> 00:02:04,580
这是什么
What is this?

57
00:02:04,580 --> 00:02:06,780
这是我们的婚前协议
Oh, this is our prenup.

58
00:02:07,040 --> 00:02:09,170
黑笔或蓝笔  完全由你做主
Black or blue? Totally up to you.

59
00:02:09,170 --> 00:02:11,360
我能先看看吗
Um, can I read it first?

60
00:02:11,360 --> 00:02:12,610
难以置信
Can you believe that?

61
00:02:12,620 --> 00:02:14,610
他想让我签婚前协议
He wants me to sign a prenup!

62
00:02:14,620 --> 00:02:15,690
难以置信
Can you believe that?

63
00:02:15,690 --> 00:02:18,360
她还想先看看
She wants to read it first!

64
00:02:18,910 --> 00:02:19,940
你就直接签吧
Just go ahead and sign.

65
00:02:19,940 --> 00:02:21,690
都是些标准化条款
It's all pretty standard.

66
00:02:22,850 --> 00:02:24,180
离婚后
"In the event of divorce,

67
00:02:24,180 --> 00:02:26,770
斯丁森先生可获准每周探视一次
"Mr. Stinson is granted weekly visitation rights

68
00:02:26,770 --> 00:02:29,260
安娜  萨拉和茉莉
to Ann, Sarah and Molly."

69
00:02:29,860 --> 00:02:31,810
你还给我们将来的孩子取了名吗
You named our future kids?

70
00:02:31,880 --> 00:02:33,600
这还蛮贴心的
That's actually pretty sweet.

71
00:02:33,600 --> 00:02:37,770
那些是斯丁森先生为您的三点区域取的名
Those are Mr. Stinson's names for your lady parts.

72
00:02:37,770 --> 00:02:40,220
孩子们要跟爸比维持良好的关系
It's important for the girls to maintain a relationship

73
00:02:40,220 --> 00:02:41,760
这点很重要哦
with their daddy.

74
00:02:43,200 --> 00:02:45,790
你给她的三点区取了名吗
You named her lady parts?

75
00:02:46,110 --> 00:02:47,760
大家都这么做
Everyone does that.

76
00:02:48,030 --> 00:02:50,190
那么  莉莉的是
So... Lily?

77
00:02:50,290 --> 00:02:52,320
噼啪  咔嚓  砰
Snap, Crackle, Pop.

78
00:02:53,030 --> 00:02:55,900
-有默契  -等等
- Solid. - Wait.

79
00:02:55,900 --> 00:02:58,380
这种婚前协议合乎常理吗
Is this prenup in any way legit?

80
00:02:58,380 --> 00:02:59,880
我是说  目前为止  这听起来
I mean, so far, it sounds a lot like

81
00:02:59,880 --> 00:03:02,590
就像是你写在酒吧纸巾上的一夜情协议
that bar napkin document you make one-night stands sign,

82
00:03:02,600 --> 00:03:03,970
好保证事后不会缠着你
promising not to get clingy.

83
00:03:03,980 --> 00:03:05,960
那是滚床单前协议  专利申请中
The Pre-Shtup, patent pending.

84
00:03:05,970 --> 00:03:08,030
天啊  我得多想点好点子
God, I gotta come up with a lot of good stuff!

85
00:03:08,170 --> 00:03:09,520
总之  我意识到
Anyway, I realize

86
00:03:09,520 --> 00:03:12,460
这些并不只是离婚协议  所以我问...
these aren't just terms for divorce, so I ask...

87
00:03:12,460 --> 00:03:15,980
这些是我要在婚后如何表现的规矩吗
Are these rules for how I have to behave in our marriage?

88
00:03:15,980 --> 00:03:17,720
规矩
Rules?

89
00:03:17,720 --> 00:03:19,950
是建议
Suggestions.

90
00:03:19,950 --> 00:03:21,830
那些富人和名人常常把这些
Rich people and celebrities put stuff like this

91
00:03:21,830 --> 00:03:23,120
写进他们的婚前协议里
in their prenups all the time.

92
00:03:23,130 --> 00:03:26,270
而那些婚姻都得以持久
And those are the marriages that last.

93
00:03:27,260 --> 00:03:31,330
我每长一磅就要付你两千美元
I have to pay $2,000 every time I gain a pound?

94
00:03:31,330 --> 00:03:33,320
不是每长一磅就算
Not every time.

95
00:03:33,320 --> 00:03:36,270
只有每周过磅的时候才算
Just if it shows up at the weekly weigh-in.

96
00:03:36,660 --> 00:03:37,990
你不能这么做
See, you can't do that.

97
00:03:37,990 --> 00:03:39,830
加维小姐每年必须发明
"Miss Garvey must invent 12 new

98
00:03:39,830 --> 00:03:41,670
12个新的性爱姿势
sexual positions per year,

99
00:03:41,670 --> 00:03:42,690
其中至少10个姿势
"At least ten of which

100
00:03:42,690 --> 00:03:45,540
是全部或大部分由她主动
involve her doing all or most of the work."

101
00:03:45,550 --> 00:03:47,590
你绝对不能这么做
You definitely can't do that.

102
00:03:47,590 --> 00:03:50,970
加维小姐必须每五年做一次隆乳
"Miss Garvey's breasts must be enhanced every five years

103
00:03:50,970 --> 00:03:54,950
或五万次抓胸  先后次序随意
or 50,000 honka-honkas, whichever comes first."

104
00:03:54,950 --> 00:03:57,260
-这其实不错  -这条我同意
- That's actually not bad. - I'll allow it.

105
00:03:58,000 --> 00:03:59,340
这简直太变态了
That's repulsive.

106
00:03:59,340 --> 00:04:01,160
再说  男人怎么会觉得
And, sidebar: why do men think

107
00:04:01,160 --> 00:04:03,140
女人喜欢被抓胸呢
women like to be honka-honka'd?

108
00:04:03,150 --> 00:04:06,300
什么女人会喜欢自己的胸被挤得像牛角
What woman wants her breasts squeezed like a seal horn?

109
00:04:06,300 --> 00:04:08,390
对啊  就是
Um... totally.

110
00:04:08,610 --> 00:04:12,410
莉莉就很爱被抓胸
Lily like-a-like-a the honka-honka.

111
00:04:13,740 --> 00:04:17,050
脖子以下的毛发必须每周脱一次
"All hair below the neck must be removed weekly."

112
00:04:17,050 --> 00:04:19,510
每周过磅的时候  你会因为少了毛发的重量
Hey, you're gonna be thanking me for that hair loss

113
00:04:19,510 --> 00:04:21,010
而感谢我的
during the weigh-in.

114
00:04:21,450 --> 00:04:23,530
加维的父母可以在我们家
"Miss Garvey's parents may stay at our place

115
00:04:23,530 --> 00:04:25,400
想待多久待多久
as long as they like."

116
00:04:25,400 --> 00:04:28,660
至少这条不错
Well, at least that one's nice.

117
00:04:29,590 --> 00:04:32,990
前提是他们被火化装进骨灰盒
Provided they each arrive in an urn.

118
00:04:33,440 --> 00:04:36,450
妻子二号到八号  每周要有两位做家里的杂务
"Wives two through eight will make a weekly chore wheel.

119
00:04:36,450 --> 00:04:38,790
抱歉  我从一个沙特阿拉伯的苏丹人
I'm sorry, I borrowed a few sections

120
00:04:38,790 --> 00:04:41,330
制定的婚前协议里借鉴了几条
from a prenup I did for a Saudi Arabian sultan.

121
00:04:41,330 --> 00:04:43,610
我会把其他一夫多妻的条款划掉
I'll cross out the extra wives stuff.

122
00:04:43,610 --> 00:04:46,930
-除非...  -划掉
- Unless... - Cross it out.

123
00:04:47,090 --> 00:04:48,810
天啊  巴尼到底觉得
My God! What the hell does Barney think

124
00:04:48,810 --> 00:04:51,120
婚姻意味着什么啊
marriage is going to be like, anyway?

125
00:04:51,120 --> 00:04:53,690
健康现代的婚姻是建立在
Just a healthy, modern-day marriage,

126
00:04:53,690 --> 00:04:57,180
两个平等的人相互尊重的基础上
based on mutual respect between two equals.

127
00:04:57,180 --> 00:05:00,370
主人  准备好享受您的叫醒大腿舞了吗
Ready for your wake-up lap dance, Master?

128
00:05:00,370 --> 00:05:02,370
你是不是忘了什么
Aren't you forgetting something?

129
00:05:02,530 --> 00:05:05,100
天啊  现在早上九点了
Oh, my God, it's 9:00 a.M.

130
00:05:05,270 --> 00:05:09,840
依法须执行的晨间枕头大战时间
Legally mandated morning pillow fight time!

131
00:05:11,910 --> 00:05:13,780
史上最棒老公
Best husband ever.

132
00:05:13,780 --> 00:05:15,830
史上最棒老公
Best husband ever.

133
00:05:15,830 --> 00:05:17,850
史上最棒老公 
Best husband ever.

134
00:05:17,850 --> 00:05:19,710
史上最棒...
Best husband e...

135
00:05:19,710 --> 00:05:21,790
抱歉抱歉  我们划掉妻子二号到八号
Sorry, sorry, we crossed out the wives

136
00:05:21,790 --> 00:05:23,820
只保留您这个大老婆  除非...  
two through eight stuff. Unless...

137
00:05:23,820 --> 00:05:25,370
-没门  -好吧  
- Nope. - Okay.

138
00:05:25,370 --> 00:05:27,630
别担心  我划掉了
Don't worry. I crossed it out.

139
00:05:27,630 --> 00:05:29,350
其实我没划掉
I didn't really cross it out.

140
00:05:29,350 --> 00:05:30,760
我听到了
I can hear you.

141
00:05:30,760 --> 00:05:33,080
我会划掉的
I'll cross it out.

142
00:05:33,710 --> 00:05:36,000
我才不会真划掉
I didn't really cross it out.

143
00:05:37,720 --> 00:05:39,150
伙计们  怎么了
Hey, guys, what's up?

144
00:05:39,150 --> 00:05:40,140
昆茵生气了
Oh, Quinn's pissed

145
00:05:40,140 --> 00:05:42,810
巴尼想让她签一份疯狂的婚前协议
because Barney wants her to sign a crazy prenup.

146
00:05:42,810 --> 00:05:44,300
真有那么疯狂吗
But is it really crazy?

147
00:05:44,300 --> 00:05:46,590
-对  -虽然我刚到  但我猜也是
- Yes. - Well, I'm new to this but guessing yes. Yes.

148
00:05:47,300 --> 00:05:49,700
听着  那我有没有...
Okay, look. Did I go...

149
00:05:49,700 --> 00:05:52,700
做出像一粒沙  一根仙女的睫毛
a speck of sand, a fairy eyelash,

150
00:05:52,700 --> 00:05:54,690
一声独角兽的耳语那么过分的要求呢
a unicorn whisper too far?

151
00:05:54,690 --> 00:05:56,260
或许吧
Perhaps.

152
00:05:57,090 --> 00:05:59,280
但是难道你们就敢说
But can you tell me there's nothing

153
00:05:59,290 --> 00:06:02,000
在你们的感情中  没有一点需要改变的地方吗
in any of your relationships you'd want to change?

154
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:04,170
没有想摒弃的行为吗
No behavior you'd want to outlaw?

155
00:06:04,170 --> 00:06:06,370
没有想重新协商的地位吗
No terms you'd want to renegotiate?

156
00:06:06,370 --> 00:06:09,840
想清楚再看着我的眼睛  说我疯了
Look me in the eye and tell me I'm crazy.

157
00:06:09,840 --> 00:06:11,700
你疯了
You're crazy.

158
00:06:12,590 --> 00:06:14,740
<i>可当晚  有意思的事发生了</i>
<i>But a funny thing happened that night.</i>

159
00:06:16,680 --> 00:06:18,940
我没说他说是对的  可...
Look, I'm not saying he's right, but

160
00:06:18,940 --> 00:06:20,770
巴尼的话的确有点道理
Barney does have a little bit of a point.

161
00:06:20,770 --> 00:06:22,400
在这一点上  他可能说得道理  
But on this one, he may have a point.

162
00:06:22,400 --> 00:06:23,360
我是说 
I mean, look...

163
00:06:23,360 --> 00:06:26,730
重新协商感情中两人地位的想法
the idea of renegotiating the terms of the relationship,

164
00:06:26,730 --> 00:06:28,340
是正确的
that's valid.

165
00:06:28,590 --> 00:06:29,750
才不是
No.

166
00:06:29,750 --> 00:06:33,130
你没有任何我想改变的地方
There isn't anything about you that I'd want to change.

167
00:06:33,630 --> 00:06:36,630
或许是有那么一两个地方
Well, okay, maybe a couple of things.

168
00:06:36,630 --> 00:06:38,430
比如什么
Like what?

169
00:06:38,430 --> 00:06:40,170
<i>就这样</i>
<i>And just like that...</i>

170
00:06:40,490 --> 00:06:44,720
<i>这四对情侣中  有一对会在第二天分手</i>
<i>one of these four couples would break up</i> <i>the very next day.</i>

171
00:06:46,770 --> 00:06:49,080
<i>当然不是莉莉和马修</i>
<i>Okay, it wasn't Lily and Marshall.</i>

172
00:06:49,210 --> 00:06:53,790
<i>这三对中  有一对会在第二天分手</i>
<i>One of these three couples would break up</i>

173
00:06:58,260 --> 00:06:59,750
怎么了
What happened?

174
00:06:59,750 --> 00:07:01,810
昨晚尼克一直在说
So last night Nick was all like,

175
00:07:01,810 --> 00:07:04,590
巴尼在"协商关系"这点上说得有道理
"Barney has a point "About renegotiating the terms

176
00:07:04,590 --> 00:07:06,440
然后说了一堆有的没的废话
of the blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah."

177
00:07:06,440 --> 00:07:07,790
对啊  马修也这样
Yeah, and Marshall was all like,

178
00:07:07,790 --> 00:07:09,620
说什么"我想干嘛干嘛"
"Uh, I want to blah, of the blah,

179
00:07:09,620 --> 00:07:11,610
废话一堆
uh, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah."

180
00:07:11,610 --> 00:07:13,830
如果我闭上眼睛  仿佛能感觉到他们的存在
If I shut my eyes it's like they're here.

181
00:07:13,830 --> 00:07:15,530
他们在借巴尼的婚前协议
They're just using Barney's prenup

182
00:07:15,530 --> 00:07:17,810
来抱怨我们的不是
as a way to complain about us.

183
00:07:17,810 --> 00:07:20,350
我只是说  你禁止了一些
I'm just saying, you've forbidden certain things

184
00:07:20,350 --> 00:07:22,410
我可能还会想去做的事
that I might like to revisit.

185
00:07:22,410 --> 00:07:25,320
马修  你不许再跟一群疯子
Marshall, you're not going on a Sasquatch hunt

186
00:07:25,320 --> 00:07:27,360
去俄勒冈州追寻大脚野人了
in Oregon with a bunch of loonies.

187
00:07:27,360 --> 00:07:28,900
疯子
Loonies?

188
00:07:29,120 --> 00:07:33,120
那些勇敢的大胡子男女都是神秘生物学家
Those brave, bearded men and women are crypto-zoologists,

189
00:07:33,120 --> 00:07:35,770
你起码该对他们的职称有所尊重
and they deserve the respect that title commands.

190
00:07:36,650 --> 00:07:38,830
但那不是我想说的重点
But that's not what I was thinking of.

191
00:07:40,650 --> 00:07:42,670
我想说的是  你太宝贝孩子了
You're too precious with the baby.

192
00:07:42,670 --> 00:07:45,660
好吧  我们第一次带马文回家
Okay, when we first came home with Marvin,

193
00:07:45,660 --> 00:07:47,680
发生了点不愉快
there was a bad moment.

194
00:07:47,680 --> 00:07:49,670
欢迎回家  孩子
Welcome home, buddy.

195
00:07:55,090 --> 00:07:56,500
真有抛那么高吗
Was it really that high?

196
00:07:56,500 --> 00:07:58,530
我不知道  我当时荷尔蒙作祟
I don't know. I was hormonal.

197
00:07:58,530 --> 00:08:00,660
突然间  这个压抑已久
And suddenly, this primal,

198
00:08:00,660 --> 00:08:03,290
充满保护欲的母亲的声音嚷了出来
protective mother voice came out of me.

199
00:08:03,290 --> 00:08:05,620
事实上  是两个声音
Actually, it was two voices.

200
00:08:05,620 --> 00:08:08,900
我严重觉得有一个是我阴道的声音
I seriously think one was coming from my vagina.

201
00:08:09,340 --> 00:08:11,660
以后再也别这样了
Never do that again!

202
00:08:12,500 --> 00:08:14,820
有什么大不了的
What is the big deal?

203
00:08:15,040 --> 00:08:18,650
我爸和我哥哥以前总把我扔来扔去的
My brothers and my dad used to roughhouse with me all the time.

204
00:08:18,690 --> 00:08:22,240
欢迎回家  马修
Welcome home, Marshall.

205
00:08:22,240 --> 00:08:24,620
孩子们
Hi. Boys...

206
00:08:24,620 --> 00:08:26,020
接好
go long.

207
00:08:28,470 --> 00:08:31,480
住手  不许在屋里玩
Stop! Not in the house.

208
00:08:31,480 --> 00:08:33,250
灯就是被你这么打碎的
That's how lamps break.

209
00:08:33,250 --> 00:08:36,260
想玩宝宝  到外面去
Now go pass that baby around outside.

210
00:08:38,630 --> 00:08:40,130
哎呀  没接住
Oh, fumble!

211
00:08:40,420 --> 00:08:42,820
我还不是茁壮成长了吗
And I turned out perfectly fine.

212
00:08:42,820 --> 00:08:44,530
马修  今天早上你还以为
Marshall, this morning you thought

213
00:08:44,530 --> 00:08:46,870
你的烤面包是鬼做的呢
a ghost made your toast.

214
00:08:47,060 --> 00:08:48,720
我没把面包放进去
I didn't put the bread in.

215
00:08:48,720 --> 00:08:50,920
你也没把面包放进去
You didn't put the bread in.

216
00:08:51,150 --> 00:08:53,520
我要跟我的儿子玩
You know what? I will play with my son

217
00:08:53,520 --> 00:08:56,330
我自有分寸  还有就是
however I see fit. And you know what else?

218
00:08:57,000 --> 00:09:00,030
今晚你得"自娱自乐"了
You can honka-honka yourself tonight.

219
00:09:00,420 --> 00:09:03,440
巴尼的婚前协议也毁了我的夜晚
Barney's prenup ruined my night, too.

220
00:09:03,510 --> 00:09:07,500
我哪种行为你不喜欢了
Okay, uh, what behavior of mine don't you like?

221
00:09:07,500 --> 00:09:09,760
我是说看电视那个
I'm talking about the TV thing.

222
00:09:09,760 --> 00:09:12,380
我们因为看电视吵架
Okay, the TV thing is an argument

223
00:09:12,380 --> 00:09:14,820
是从三周前就开始了
from, like, three weeks ago.

224
00:09:22,500 --> 00:09:24,000
抱歉
Oh, I'm sorry.

225
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:26,120
没想到要42英寸
Didn't realize it takes 42 inches

226
00:09:26,120 --> 00:09:27,540
才能让你满足
to keep you satisfied.

227
00:09:27,540 --> 00:09:28,950
电视正好开着
The TV happened to be on.

228
00:09:28,950 --> 00:09:30,320
我正好瞥到一眼
I happened to glance at it.

229
00:09:30,320 --> 00:09:32,150
-那样会很怪吗  -不会啊

230
00:09:32,150 --> 00:09:34,680
-一点也不  -谢谢

我可能是有点怪
I may be a little weird.

232
00:09:43,150 --> 00:09:44,810
真舒服
Oh, yeah.

233
00:09:45,530 --> 00:09:48,950
做爱时  我看着自己播新闻的样子
I get... turned on watching myself

234
00:09:48,950 --> 00:09:51,190
变得无比性奋
do the news during sex.

235
00:09:52,620 --> 00:09:53,980
对  是有点奇怪
Yeah, that's a little weird.

236
00:09:53,980 --> 00:09:56,460
听着  看着电视上的自己
Look, seeing myself on TV makes me

237
00:09:56,460 --> 00:09:58,490
让我觉得自信又性感
feel confident and sexy.

238
00:09:58,500 --> 00:10:01,960
没什么好丢人的  是吧  姐妹们
And that is nothing to be ashamed of, right, sisters?

239
00:10:03,400 --> 00:10:05,040
-这事别再提了  -永远别提
- Never speak of this. - Ever.

240
00:10:05,040 --> 00:10:07,420
好  那是当然
Yeah, of course. Yeah.

241
00:10:08,400 --> 00:10:09,860
其实还有
There's more.

242
00:10:14,670 --> 00:10:15,220
等等
Wait.

243
00:10:15,220 --> 00:10:18,030
你在直播早上七点新闻的时候
So when you're doing the news live at 7:00,

244
00:10:18,030 --> 00:10:22,410
对晚上看十一点重播的自己抛媚眼
you wink to future you watching the rebroadcast at 11:00?

245
00:10:23,980 --> 00:10:25,380
可能吧
Maybe.

246
00:10:26,350 --> 00:10:28,740
-这事别再提了  -永远别提
- Never speak of this.- Ever

247
00:10:28,910 --> 00:10:30,320
你们不会相信
You won't believe

248

249
00:10:32,250 --> 00:10:34,770
你说你很乐意帮他

现在我改主意了

抱歉打扰了  室友
Sorry to interrupt, roomie,

252
00:10:37,880 --> 00:10:38,970
我想做香肠
but I am trying to make sausage.

253
00:10:38,970 --> 00:10:41,270
你家猪肠子放在哪里
Where do you keep your pig intestines?

254
00:10:41,520 --> 00:10:44,450
你的前未婚夫在泰德家干嘛
What's your ex-fiance doing at Ted's?

255

克劳斯几周前来找我
Klaus came to me a few weeks ago.

如果你能让我在你家厨房水槽
If I could just take a quick whore's bath

261

洗洗腋下和胯下  然后我立马走人

这是你的公寓
This is your apartment.

268

把这里当作是我们的公寓吧
Think of this as our apartment.

是呀  过不了五分钟  英雄就会后悔

一个接一个地出来

303

突然之间  没有"我们的"公寓这一说了
Suddenly, it wasn't our apartment anymore.

304
00:12:36,570 --> 00:12:38,520
我没有发言权了
I had no say in the matter.

305
00:12:38,520 --> 00:12:40,350
这些家伙太不像话了
These guys are unbelievable.

306
00:12:40,350 --> 00:12:42,400
我这就回家
You know what, I am gonna go home

307
00:12:42,410 --> 00:12:45,970
自己一个人"看"新闻
and watch the news all by myself.

308
00:12:45,970 --> 00:12:47,250
等等
Wait.

309
00:12:47,560 --> 00:12:49,220
我有个主意
I have an idea.

310
00:12:50,820 --> 00:12:52,180
知道吗
You know what?

311
00:12:52,320 --> 00:12:54,440
我同意签署婚前协议
I'm on board with the whole prenup thing.

312
00:12:54,440 --> 00:12:55,650
太好了
That's great.

313
00:12:55,650 --> 00:12:57,850
婚前协议也是保护你啊  小甜心
It's here to protect you, too, sweetie...

314
00:12:57,850 --> 00:13:01,250
以防你变得对我不具吸引力
from becoming unappealing to me.

315
00:13:01,500 --> 00:13:03,780
事实上  我找人帮了点忙
Actually, I made my own prenup

316
00:13:03,780 --> 00:13:05,430
拟定了自己的婚前协议
with a little help.

317
00:13:05,430 --> 00:13:07,210
女士们
Ladies?

318
00:13:12,490 --> 00:13:15,120
直接签字吧  全是标准的法律条款
Go ahead and sign. It's all pretty standard.

319
00:13:16,530 --> 00:13:18,850
现在可能不太合适问这个
This might not be the best time to ask--

320
00:13:18,850 --> 00:13:20,920
我现在算是重回情场了
I'm sort of getting back in the game.

321
00:13:20,920 --> 00:13:22,310
那个抱孩子的红发妞
The redhead with the baby,

322
00:13:22,310 --> 00:13:24,350
有主了吗
what's her situation?

323
00:13:29,710 --> 00:13:32,380
离婚后  加维小姐将获得  
"In the event of divorce, Miss Garvey shall get

324
00:13:32,380 --> 00:13:35,720
斯丁森先生西服的全部监护权
full custody of Mr. Stinson's suits"?

325
00:13:35,720 --> 00:13:37,170
为什么
Why?

326
00:13:37,170 --> 00:13:39,500
-你怎么处理它们  -置之不理
- What would you do with them? - Nothing.

327
00:13:39,500 --> 00:13:42,320
我就是坐着看它们慢慢过时
I'd just sit around and watch them go out of style.

328
00:13:42,320 --> 00:13:44,620
这也太变态了吧
That is just sick.

329
00:13:44,620 --> 00:13:46,080
继续看吧
Keep reading.

330
00:13:46,260 --> 00:13:48,320
斯丁森先生可以参加
"Mr. Stinson is allowed to attend

331
00:13:48,330 --> 00:13:50,710
花花公子女郎宿舍的任何活动
any function at the Playboy Mansion."

332
00:13:50,710 --> 00:13:52,550
至少这条不错
Well, at least that's nice.

333
00:13:53,610 --> 00:13:56,520
前提是他被火化装进骨灰瓮
"Provided he arrives in an urn."

334
00:13:59,210 --> 00:14:01,090
先生们  来得正好
Gentlemen, just in time.

335
00:14:01,090 --> 00:14:02,620
你们这些贱人来干嘛
What are you bitches doing here?

336
00:14:02,620 --> 00:14:04,200
-莉莉  -他在睡觉
- Lily. - Oh, he's napping.

337
00:14:04,210 --> 00:14:05,960
只有这时候我才能发泄两句
It's the only time I get to go blue.

338
00:14:05,970 --> 00:14:09,130
巴尼发短信说你们集体来找他茬
Barney texted us that you guys were ganging up on him.

339
00:14:09,130 --> 00:14:10,960
所以我们只是来确保
So we're just here to ensure

340
00:14:10,960 --> 00:14:13,150
他不会签什么会让他后悔的东西
he doesn't sign anything he'll regret.

341
00:14:13,150 --> 00:14:16,580
不好意思  这里只有我才是律师
I'm sorry, I don't think anyone here other than me is a lawyer.

342
00:14:16,580 --> 00:14:19,930
一名高薪成功的律师
A well-paid, successful lawyer.

343
00:14:20,880 --> 00:14:22,500
我也是律师
I-I'm a lawyer.

344
00:14:22,700 --> 00:14:24,310
事实上  我们曾共事过几年
Actually, we worked together for years.

345
00:14:24,310 --> 00:14:27,190
闪一边儿去  大高个  是我先瞧见她的
Back off, stretch, I saw her first.

346
00:14:27,450 --> 00:14:28,770
等等
Hang on a second.

347
00:14:28,770 --> 00:14:32,190
只要斯丁森先生不能"随鸡变硬"
"A half million dollar fine any time Mr. Stinson can't

348
00:14:32,190 --> 00:14:34,450
就要处以50万美元的罚款
 'rise to the occasion,'

349
00:14:34,450 --> 00:14:38,100
提示  悲惨的下垂口哨声
cue sad slide whistle sounds"?

350
00:14:39,910 --> 00:14:41,960
这个电击圈是怎么回事
Hey, what's this about a shock collar?

351
00:14:41,960 --> 00:14:44,140
那个啊  我们来解释
Ah, yes, we'll explain.

352
00:14:44,140 --> 00:14:48,380
加维小姐会有很多的迷人的朋友来做客
Miss Garvey has many attractive friends who will come to visit.

353
00:14:48,920 --> 00:14:52,060
来点我做的山羊奶酪酥吗  小姐  
May I offer you some goat cheese puff pastries I made, mistress?

354
00:14:52,060 --> 00:14:54,840
只要你默默端上来就行
As long as you can do it quietly.

355
00:15:02,330 --> 00:15:03,740
慢着  我糊涂了
Wait, I'm confused.

356
00:15:03,750 --> 00:15:04,900
如果不是套在我脖子上  
If it's not around my neck,

357
00:15:04,900 --> 00:15:06,930
那这个电击圈套在哪里啊
then where's the shock collar?

358
00:15:08,300 --> 00:15:10,520
我的娘哟
Oh, God.

359
00:15:10,520 --> 00:15:12,810
我的亲娘哟
Oh, God.

360
00:15:12,810 --> 00:15:15,340
其实说电击环更准确些
It's more of a shock ring, really.

361
00:15:15,350 --> 00:15:16,590
她的主意
Her idea.

362
00:15:16,590 --> 00:15:19,340
原来是美貌与智慧并存啊
Little missy is packing a brain, too.

363
00:15:20,070 --> 00:15:21,300
好吧
Okay, you know what?

364
00:15:21,300 --> 00:15:22,800
既然我们都来了
Since we're all pitching in,

365
00:15:22,800 --> 00:15:25,000
我能建议加项条款吗
may I suggest a provision?

366
00:15:25,020 --> 00:15:29,200
你们生了儿子以后  斯丁森先生有权以
In the event that you have a son, Mr. Stinson is free

367
00:15:29,200 --> 00:15:31,740
他认为适当的方式和儿子玩耍
to play with his child however he sees fit.

368
00:15:31,740 --> 00:15:33,900
再加一条禁止你未来的老公
How about forbidding your future husband

369
00:15:33,900 --> 00:15:36,750
用球棒把孩子打进婴儿床如何
from spiking his child into his crib?

370
00:15:36,750 --> 00:15:39,070
再加一条避免你被她用来
How about a clause protecting you from having to engage

371
00:15:39,070 --> 00:15:42,080
和常规电视节目玩"三人行"的条款如何
in a three-way with her and whatever's on basic cable?

372
00:15:42,080 --> 00:15:44,570
是吗  那要不要禁止
Oh, yeah? How about forbidding...

373
00:15:46,090 --> 00:15:47,550
我想不出来
I got nothing.

374
00:15:47,620 --> 00:15:50,380
再加一条禁止光屁股前德国佬未婚夫
How about a provision barring any nudist German ex-fiance

375
00:15:50,380 --> 00:15:52,560
在我的沙发上磨蹭他的"香肠"如何
from slapping his strudel up and down your sofa?

376
00:15:52,560 --> 00:15:54,280
再加上逞能装英雄
How about pretending to be a hero,

377
00:15:54,280 --> 00:15:57,820
结果被雪貂咬破皮就怂成软蛋了如何
but then caving the moment a ferret bite breaks the skin?

378
00:15:57,820 --> 00:15:59,500
是咬破了我的眼皮
The skin of my eyelid.

379
00:15:59,500 --> 00:16:01,080
那是雪貂亲吻的方式
That's how they kiss.

380
00:16:01,090 --> 00:16:03,110
你是认真的吗
Are you serious?

381
00:16:07,540 --> 00:16:09,640
够了  够了
Enough! Enough!

382
00:16:09,640 --> 00:16:10,890
你们都拥有深爱自己的人
You all have someone who loves you,

383
00:16:10,890 --> 00:16:13,090
却要亲手毁掉这一切  为了什么啊
and you're screwing it up, and over what?

384
00:16:13,090 --> 00:16:14,740
就为了比谁权力大吗
Who has the most power?

385
00:16:14,750 --> 00:16:16,150
这不是真爱
That's not love.

386
00:16:16,150 --> 00:16:18,390
真爱是足够信任对方
Love is trusting someone enough

387
00:16:18,390 --> 00:16:20,420
敢于说出让自己困扰的事情
to tell them what's really bothering you.

388
00:16:20,420 --> 00:16:21,600
所以我们就要这么做
So that's what we're gonna do.

389
00:16:21,600 --> 00:16:23,150
从你开始
You, start.

390
00:16:26,190 --> 00:16:28,670
当你为了马文惊慌失措时
When you got scared about Marvin,

391
00:16:28,670 --> 00:16:31,100
感觉好像你在暗示
it felt like you were saying that

392
00:16:31,460 --> 00:16:34,250
我不是像你这样称职的父母
I'm not as good a parent as you.

393
00:16:34,990 --> 00:16:36,360
你是个很棒的妈妈
You're an amazing mom,

394
00:16:36,360 --> 00:16:39,580
我希望能和你一样
and I want to live up to that.

395
00:16:41,390 --> 00:16:44,040
我可能会对别人缺乏信任
Well, I probably have trust issues

396
00:16:44,040 --> 00:16:46,660
因为小时候爸爸总不在我身边
because my dad wasn't there for me.

397
00:16:46,670 --> 00:16:50,120
但我知道你会永远稳稳地接住马文
But I know that you'll always be there to catch Marvin.

398
00:16:51,270 --> 00:16:53,190
接下来轮到你
You, next.

399
00:16:55,250 --> 00:16:58,120
跟克劳斯住在一起
Having Klaus back in our lives

400
00:16:58,480 --> 00:17:02,130
让我害怕我们永远摆脱不了过去
made me scared we're never gonna escape the past.

401
00:17:02,460 --> 00:17:03,980
我之所以想帮克劳斯
I only wanted to help Klaus

402
00:17:03,990 --> 00:17:07,730
是因为我们的幸福  让我觉得有愧于他
because I feel guilty about how happy I am with you.

403
00:17:09,070 --> 00:17:10,580
到你们了
Next.

404
00:17:11,590 --> 00:17:13,660
我觉得你非常性感
I find you so sexy,

405
00:17:13,660 --> 00:17:17,050
而发现你对我没有同样的感觉  我很受伤
it just hurt that you don't feel the same about me.

406
00:17:18,760 --> 00:17:22,830
我做爱时  会被播新闻的自己挑起"性"致
I get turned on watching myself do the news during sex.

407
00:17:25,670 --> 00:17:27,310
我可以接受
Well, that's cool.

408
00:17:30,550 --> 00:17:32,780
看看  不需要任何法律文件
Look at that, no legal documents needed.

409
00:17:32,780 --> 00:17:34,850
只需坦诚相对  愿意改变
Just honesty and vulnerability.

410
00:17:34,850 --> 00:17:36,120
这就是爱
That's love.

411
00:17:36,120 --> 00:17:38,440
曾经我也深爱过某人
You see, I once loved someone,

412
00:17:38,440 --> 00:17:40,470
可惜我说得不够多
only I didn't say it enough.

413
00:17:40,470 --> 00:17:43,210
现在我希望我每天都大声地说出来
Now I wish I could say it every day.

414
00:17:43,210 --> 00:17:45,280
管它疯不疯狂
Hell, i don't care if it's crazy,

415
00:17:45,280 --> 00:17:47,290
我要弥补回来
I-I'm doing it.

416
00:17:48,020 --> 00:17:49,630
达琳吗
Hello, Darlene?

417
00:17:49,810 --> 00:17:51,830
让小拖船听电话
Put Tugboat on the line.

418
00:17:51,950 --> 00:17:53,060
老伙计
Hey, buddy.

419
00:17:53,060 --> 00:17:54,840
是我啊
Hey, it's the man.

420
00:17:56,700 --> 00:17:57,920
<i>在那一刻</i>
<i>And for a moment,</i>

421
00:17:57,920 --> 00:18:00,180
<i>世界回到了正轨</i>
<i>all felt right with the world.</i>

422
00:18:00,530 --> 00:18:01,960
<i>但当天夜里</i>
<i>But that very night,</i>

423
00:18:01,960 --> 00:18:05,200
<i>分手之秋出现了第一对受害者</i>
<i>the Autumn of Breakups would claim its first victims.</i>

424
00:18:05,200 --> 00:18:07,370
祝您今晚平安  愉快
...wish you a very safe and pleasant evening.

425
00:18:07,370 --> 00:18:08,900
晚安
Good night.

晚安

晚安
Good night.

428
00:18:17,600 --> 00:18:18,970
晚安
Good night.

429
00:18:19,580 --> 00:18:20,610
晚安哟
Gute Nacht.

430
00:18:20,610 --> 00:18:21,740
小宝贝们也晚安哈
And you too, my babies.

431
00:18:21,750 --> 00:18:24,410
谢谢你们甜蜜的眼皮吻
Oh, danke for the sweet eye kisses.

432
00:18:25,420 --> 00:18:26,650
您先请  先生
After you, sir.

433
00:18:26,650 --> 00:18:28,130
女士优先
Ladies first.

434
00:18:28,130 --> 00:18:29,280
你先丢
I insist.

435
00:18:29,280 --> 00:18:30,960
你先丢
I insist.

436
00:18:31,680 --> 00:18:33,980
-我不会先扔掉  -我也不会先扔掉
- I'm not throwing mine out first. - I'm not throwing mine out first.

437
00:18:33,980 --> 00:18:36,240
你跟全纽约一半的女孩都上过床
You've slept with half the women in New York.

438
00:18:36,240 --> 00:18:37,530
我才是需要婚前协议保护的那个
I'm the one who needs a prenup.

439
00:18:37,530 --> 00:18:39,720
你这些年骗走了我好几万大洋
You duped me out of thousands of dollars.

440
00:18:39,720 --> 00:18:41,090
我才是需要婚前协议保护的那个
I'm the one who needs a prenup.

441
00:18:41,090 --> 00:18:42,360
我刚想到还可以加上几条
I just thought of some more stuff to add.

442
00:18:42,360 --> 00:18:44,410
我这还没完成一半呢
I'm not half finished.

443
00:18:51,770 --> 00:18:53,340
我们开始吧
Let's dive in.

444
00:18:58,350 --> 00:19:00,740
婚姻没那么复杂  不是吗
It should be simpler than this, shouldn't it?

445
00:19:00,740 --> 00:19:02,140
是
Yeah.

446
00:19:02,990 --> 00:19:04,540
或许不该这么复杂
Maybe it should be.

447
00:19:06,230 --> 00:19:07,940
巴尼  你相信我吗
Barney, do you trust me?

448
00:19:12,550 --> 00:19:13,930
不
No.

449
00:19:15,380 --> 00:19:16,850
你相信我吗
Do you trust me?

450
00:19:18,570 --> 00:19:19,980
不
No.

451
00:19:23,210 --> 00:19:24,540
如果我们需要这么大费周章
If we really need something

452
00:19:24,540 --> 00:19:27,220
才能够结婚的话
this complicated to get married...

453
00:19:31,740 --> 00:19:33,090
没错
Yeah.

454
00:19:33,880 --> 00:19:38,370

我娶她纯粹因为她爸有钱

可维尔汉姆早就打过一次蜡了
but Wilhelm has already completed this task!

480
00:21:00,410 --> 00:21:03,100
这虽然是喜剧
You know, it's big comedy.

481
00:21:03,100 --> 00:21:06,300
