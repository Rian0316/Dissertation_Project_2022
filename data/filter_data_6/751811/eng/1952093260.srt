1
00:00:03,340 --> 00:00:04,660
At Birmingham East,

2
00:00:04,820 --> 00:00:07,209
the Returning Officer
is declaring the result.

3
00:00:07,380 --> 00:00:11,089
James George Hacker: 21,793.

4
00:00:11,940 --> 00:00:14,773
Arthur William Gaunt: 19,321.

5
00:00:14,940 --> 00:00:19,172
So Jim Hacker's back, and after
many years as a Shadow Minister

6
00:00:19,340 --> 00:00:22,571
seems almost certain to get
a post in the new Government.

7
00:00:57,212 --> 00:00:59,168
- I haven't had a call yet.
- Who from?

8
00:00:59,332 --> 00:01:01,926
- Our new Prime Minister.
- What do you expect?

9
00:01:02,092 --> 00:01:04,367
The car's only just got back
from the Palace.

10
00:01:05,732 --> 00:01:07,484
Any moment now, then.

11
00:01:08,372 --> 00:01:09,885
So who was on the phone?

12
00:01:10,492 --> 00:01:12,608
Frank Wiesel.
He's coming right over.

13
00:01:12,772 --> 00:01:14,569
Why doesn't he just move in?

14
00:01:14,772 --> 00:01:17,286
Annie, he's my political adviser.

15
00:01:17,452 --> 00:01:20,444
- I depend on him.
- Why don't you marry him?

16
00:01:20,612 --> 00:01:23,490
Darling, you do over- react
to everything, so.

17
00:01:23,652 --> 00:01:24,846
Here we are!

18
00:01:25,452 --> 00:01:28,410
Jim Hacker... yes.
Oh, it's you.

19
00:01:28,652 --> 00:01:30,449
Yes, was a good party.

20
00:01:30,652 --> 00:01:33,724
Yes, I've got a bit of a headache...
I will ring you back.

21
00:01:33,892 --> 00:01:37,202
I'm waiting fora rather
important call... bye bye.

22
00:01:39,372 --> 00:01:41,169
Alderman Spottiswood.

23
00:01:41,932 --> 00:01:45,004
I wish people wouldn't ring
to congratulate me.

24
00:01:45,172 --> 00:01:46,969
I'm waiting forthe call.

25
00:01:47,132 --> 00:01:49,248
It's as if you're about
to enterthe Ministry.

26
00:01:49,412 --> 00:01:51,243
Yes, but which Ministry,
that's the point.

27
00:01:51,452 --> 00:01:52,726
Itwas a joke!

28
00:01:53,412 --> 00:01:55,004
Oh, I see.

29
00:01:58,892 --> 00:02:01,087
- Are you very tense?
- No, I'm not.

30
00:02:01,252 --> 00:02:03,891
A politician's wife
is not allowed to.

31
00:02:04,052 --> 00:02:06,441
A happy carefree
politician's wife.

32
00:02:09,572 --> 00:02:12,006
- What are you looking for?
- A cigarette.

33
00:02:12,172 --> 00:02:13,491
Try the cigarette box.

34
00:02:13,652 --> 00:02:15,722
- It's empty.
- Take a librium.

35
00:02:15,892 --> 00:02:19,441
I can't find it, that's why
I'm looking fora cigarette.

36
00:02:20,452 --> 00:02:24,127
Oh, Jim, I've had it. Would you
pop out and get some?

37
00:02:24,292 --> 00:02:26,681
Sorry, I daren't leave the phone.

38
00:02:26,932 --> 00:02:29,844
If the PM wants you to be
in the cabinet,

39
00:02:30,012 --> 00:02:32,606
he'll phone back.
Oryou can phone back.

40
00:02:32,772 --> 00:02:36,242
I ran the campaign against
the PM forthe leadership.

41
00:02:36,412 --> 00:02:39,688
- If I'm out, well, who knows.
- I could take a message.

42
00:02:41,932 --> 00:02:42,967
There it is.

43
00:02:44,892 --> 00:02:46,644
Hello... yes, speaking...

44
00:02:47,252 --> 00:02:49,049
Oh, it's you Michael...

45
00:02:49,892 --> 00:02:51,928
I haven't had a call,
have you?

46
00:02:52,092 --> 00:02:53,525
Bill's had a call?

47
00:02:53,732 --> 00:02:55,848
What's he got? Europe?

48
00:02:56,092 --> 00:02:58,526
- Bill's got Europe.
- Lucky Europe.

49
00:02:59,332 --> 00:03:02,927
- Does Bill speak French?
- He can hardly speak English.

50
00:03:03,732 --> 00:03:07,008
I'll call you back if I hear
anything. Right... Bye.

51
00:03:12,132 --> 00:03:13,451
Fingers crossed.

52
00:03:13,612 --> 00:03:15,603
Hello... Yes, speaking...

53
00:03:16,692 --> 00:03:18,250
The Gas Board.

54
00:03:20,652 --> 00:03:23,041
Good Lord man,
thatwas weeks ago.

55
00:03:23,212 --> 00:03:26,090
I'm waiting
fora rather important call...

56
00:03:27,092 --> 00:03:31,085
Look, there happened to be
a general election yesterday...

57
00:03:31,452 --> 00:03:34,330
You voted forthe otherside,
did you?

58
00:03:34,492 --> 00:03:37,962
How did you get to the polling
booth on the right day?

59
00:03:38,132 --> 00:03:41,249
With two assistants,
three return visits forspare parts?

60
00:03:41,412 --> 00:03:43,403
Look, Mr. Franklin...
Frankly Franklin,

61
00:03:43,572 --> 00:03:46,530
I don't care if the heating system
collapses in ruins.

62
00:03:46,692 --> 00:03:49,252
I've got to get off this phone,
goodbye.

63
00:03:49,452 --> 00:03:50,680
They won't come now.

64
00:03:50,852 --> 00:03:53,605
If I get ConsumerAffairs,
they'll come.

65
00:03:54,772 --> 00:03:56,285
Hello?

66
00:03:56,452 --> 00:03:58,044
Hello? Hello?

67
00:03:58,212 --> 00:04:01,329
Darling, thatwas
the front doorbell.

68
00:04:02,252 --> 00:04:03,651
It'll be Frank.

69
00:04:07,812 --> 00:04:10,326
- Martin's got the Foreign Office.
- Has he?

70
00:04:10,492 --> 00:04:12,403
Jack's got Health
and Fred's got Energy.

71
00:04:12,572 --> 00:04:15,040
- Has anyone got Brains?
- Do you mean Education?

72
00:04:15,212 --> 00:04:17,043
No, I knowwhat I mean.

73
00:04:17,212 --> 00:04:20,170
- What's left? What have I got?
- Rhythm?

74
00:04:21,772 --> 00:04:24,525
Frank, I have heard
absolutely nothing,

75
00:04:24,692 --> 00:04:26,523
not that it's surprising.

76
00:04:26,692 --> 00:04:28,967
My whole career
is going down the drain

77
00:04:29,132 --> 00:04:32,681
because the PM is unable
to reach me on the telephone.

78
00:04:35,252 --> 00:04:37,049
You get it, darling.

79
00:04:39,572 --> 00:04:41,847
- Hello.
- Hello, this is the BBC.

80
00:04:42,012 --> 00:04:46,085
Would Mr. Hacker like to be
interviewed on the PM program?

81
00:04:46,252 --> 00:04:48,163
- PM?
- PM?

82
00:04:49,692 --> 00:04:50,966

Yes. Any time you like.

85
00:04:55,812 --> 00:04:57,882
Could we interview you?

86
00:04:58,052 --> 00:05:00,122
I'd been hoping you'd call.

87
00:05:00,812 --> 00:05:03,610
What job do you think
you're likely to get?

88
00:05:04,532 --> 00:05:05,885
I beg yourpardon?

89
00:05:07,572 --> 00:05:10,086
What job do you think
you're likely to get?

90
00:05:10,692 --> 00:05:12,762
That's foryou to tell me.

91
00:05:13,212 --> 00:05:16,249
- What?
- Well, it's not up to me to say.

92
00:05:16,412 --> 00:05:19,848
That's forthe PM to say.
You're the PM's office...

93
00:05:20,812 --> 00:05:24,646
Oh, I see.
The BBC PM office!

94
00:05:25,212 --> 00:05:29,649
How silly, what a silly mistake,
Yes... yes. Good bye.

95
00:05:31,412 --> 00:05:33,130
I did try and tell you.

96
00:05:34,852 --> 00:05:37,127
You answerthe bloody thing.

97
00:05:38,932 --> 00:05:40,524

98
00:05:41,132 --> 00:05:43,009

Kenneth, isn't he on the young
side fora Cabinet post?

107
00:06:13,652 --> 00:06:16,803
Yes, well, he's in his late forties.

108
00:06:16,972 --> 00:06:19,532
But it's certainly
a jump up forhim.

109
00:06:19,692 --> 00:06:21,648
On the otherhand,
this department's been

110
00:06:21,812 --> 00:06:24,645
a bit of a political graveyard
recently.

111
00:06:28,692 --> 00:06:30,728

112
00:06:30,892 --> 00:06:33,008

00:07:39,772 --> 00:07:42,411
- Precisely, sir.

Oh quite, quite.
I see what you mean.

139
00:08:10,132 --> 00:08:13,249
Do I have to call you Private

Allowme to present
Sir Humphrey Appleby,

144
00:08:27,492 --> 00:08:30,370
Permanent UnderSecretary
of State and Head of the D. A. A.

147
00:08:35,572 --> 00:08:40,123
Yes, we did cross swords in
the Public Accounts Committee.

148
00:08:40,292 --> 00:08:41,361
I wouldn't say that.

149
00:08:41,532 --> 00:08:43,762
You came up
with all the questions.

150
00:08:43,932 --> 00:08:45,888
Opposition's about asking
questions.

151
00:08:46,052 --> 00:08:48,122
And Government's about
not answering them.

152
00:08:48,452 --> 00:08:49,965
You answered mine.

153
00:08:50,332 --> 00:08:51,924
I'm glad you thought so.

154
00:08:54,052 --> 00:08:55,565
Good luck.

155
00:08:56,172 --> 00:09:00,529
- Who else is in this Department?
- I am the Permanent UnderSecretary

156
00:09:00,692 --> 00:09:02,523
known as
the Permanent Secretary.

157
00:09:02,692 --> 00:09:05,889
Wolley is your Principal
Private Secretary.

158
00:09:06,052 --> 00:09:09,089
And I too have a Principal
Private Secretary.

159
00:09:09,932 --> 00:09:12,685
Directly responsible to me
are 10 Deputy Secretaries

160
00:09:12,852 --> 00:09:16,640
87 UnderSecretaries,
and 219 Assistant Secretaries.

161
00:09:16,812 --> 00:09:18,165
Responsible to the PPS

162
00:09:18,332 --> 00:09:20,766
are Parliamentary
Private Secretaries.

163
00:09:20,932 --> 00:09:24,049
The PM will be appointing two
Parliamentary UnderSecretaries,

164
00:09:24,212 --> 00:09:26,851
and you will appoint yourown
Parliamentary Private Secretary.

165
00:09:28,412 --> 00:09:30,050
Can they all type?

166
00:09:31,332 --> 00:09:32,811
None of us can type.

167
00:09:32,972 --> 00:09:34,451
Mrs. McKay types.

168
00:09:34,972 --> 00:09:36,803
She is the Secretary.

169
00:09:37,572 --> 00:09:39,608
Pity we could have opened
an agency.

170
00:09:39,772 --> 00:09:41,842
- Very droll, sir.
- Yes, very very amusing.

171
00:09:42,012 --> 00:09:45,368
- I suppose they all say that.
- Certainly not, Minister.

172
00:09:45,532 --> 00:09:47,284
Not quite all.

173
00:09:47,572 --> 00:09:49,722
Right, now then, to business.

174
00:09:50,492 --> 00:09:55,088
Forgive me if I'm a bit blunt,
but that's the sort of chap I am...

175
00:09:55,332 --> 00:09:57,050
Frankly, this depart...

176
00:09:57,212 --> 00:09:58,850
This chair's a bit...

177
00:09:59,012 --> 00:10:00,889
We can change it, Minister.

178
00:10:01,052 --> 00:10:04,283
We can change the furniture,
decor, office routine...

179
00:10:04,452 --> 00:10:07,364
- Yourwish is ourcommand.
- I'd like a new chair.

180
00:10:07,532 --> 00:10:08,726
Hate swivel chairs.

181
00:10:08,892 --> 00:10:11,884
Two kinds of chairs to go
with the two kinds of Minister.

182
00:10:12,052 --> 00:10:13,724
One sort folds up instantly,

183
00:10:13,892 --> 00:10:16,804
the othersort goes
round and round in circles.

184
00:10:21,972 --> 00:10:24,850
Now, frankly this Department
has got to cut

185
00:10:25,012 --> 00:10:28,561
a great swathe through all this
stuffy Whitehall bureaucracy.

186
00:10:28,732 --> 00:10:31,166
We're going to throw open
the windows,

187
00:10:31,332 --> 00:10:34,051
let in a bit of fresh air,
cut through all the red tape,

188
00:10:34,212 --> 00:10:36,806
streamline this creaking
old bureaucratic machine.

189
00:10:36,972 --> 00:10:39,406
- You mean a clean sweep?
- A clean sweep.

190
00:10:39,572 --> 00:10:42,882
Fartoo many people
just sitting behind desks.

191
00:10:46,172 --> 00:10:47,651
Not like us, of course.

192
00:10:47,812 --> 00:10:50,451
Butwe've got to get rid
of all those people.

193
00:10:50,612 --> 00:10:53,126
- Get rid of them?
- "Redeploy them".

194
00:10:53,292 --> 00:10:56,568
Yes. Good Lord no, I don't mean
put them out of work.

195
00:10:56,732 --> 00:10:59,485
Open Government,
that's what my partybelieves in,

196
00:10:59,652 --> 00:11:01,688
thatwas the main plank
of ourmanifesto.

197
00:11:01,852 --> 00:11:04,241
Taking the nation
into ourconfidence.

198
00:11:04,412 --> 00:11:07,609
Nowhow does that strike you?
Do sit down.

199
00:11:07,772 --> 00:11:10,684
Just as you said in the House
on May 2nd last year,

200
00:11:10,852 --> 00:11:12,444
and again on November 23rd,

201
00:11:12,612 --> 00:11:15,285
and in The Observer
and in The Daily Mail,

202
00:11:15,452 --> 00:11:17,602
and as yourmanifesto
made clear.

203
00:11:17,772 --> 00:11:19,285
You know about that?

204
00:11:19,452 --> 00:11:22,012
Please, have a look
at these proposals.

205
00:11:22,172 --> 00:11:25,289
These are the ways
to implement this policy

206
00:11:25,452 --> 00:11:28,330
and proposals fora white paper
foryourapproval.

207
00:11:28,492 --> 00:11:31,370
The white papermight be called
"Open Government".

208
00:11:32,372 --> 00:11:35,967
- You mean it's all been...
- Taken care of, Minister.

209
00:11:37,292 --> 00:11:40,364
- Who did all this?
- The old bureaucratic machine.

210
00:11:40,532 --> 00:11:42,124
No, quite seriously.

211
00:11:42,932 --> 00:11:45,492
We are seized
of the need forreform.

212
00:11:45,652 --> 00:11:49,088
- And we have taken it on board.
- I'm rathersurprised.

213
00:11:49,252 --> 00:11:52,005
I expected to have
to fight you with this.

214
00:11:52,172 --> 00:11:54,481
People do have funny ideas
about the Civil Service.

215
00:11:54,652 --> 00:11:57,485
We're just here
to implement yourpolicies.

216
00:11:57,652 --> 00:12:00,883
"Proposals forshortening approval
procedures in planning appeals"?

217
00:12:01,052 --> 00:12:05,091
Hansard Volume 497,
page 1102, Column B.

218
00:12:05,252 --> 00:12:06,685
Quote "Mr. Hacker:

219
00:12:06,852 --> 00:12:09,412
Is the Ministeraware
that planning procedures

220
00:12:09,572 --> 00:12:11,403
make building a bungalow
in the 20th century

221
00:12:11,572 --> 00:12:14,370
slowerthan building a cathedral
in the 12th century?

222
00:12:14,532 --> 00:12:17,171
Opposition laughter
and Government cries of shame".

223
00:12:17,332 --> 00:12:21,325
- They didn't actually cry shame.
- Quite so, Minister.

224
00:12:21,612 --> 00:12:26,322
- Right, I think that's it then?
- There are two more things...

225
00:12:26,492 --> 00:12:29,484
This is yourdiary
fornextweek, Minister.

226
00:12:29,652 --> 00:12:32,086
My diary?
You didn't know I was coming.

227
00:12:32,252 --> 00:12:33,924
Norwho'd win the election.

228
00:12:34,092 --> 00:12:37,368
- There'd be a Minister, Minister.
- Don't start that again.

229
00:12:38,372 --> 00:12:40,761
Even though we didn't know
itwould be you.

230
00:12:40,932 --> 00:12:43,492
Her Majesty does like
the business of government

231
00:12:43,652 --> 00:12:46,212
to continue even when
there are no politicians around.

232
00:12:46,372 --> 00:12:49,603
- Bit difficult surely?
- Yes... and no.

233
00:12:51,172 --> 00:12:53,970
It's a busy week.
Nine cabinet committees,

234
00:12:54,132 --> 00:12:56,202
the Annual dinner
of the Law Institute.

235
00:12:56,372 --> 00:12:57,600
You will have to make a speech.

236
00:12:57,772 --> 00:13:00,969
Deputation from the British
ComputerAssociation.

237
00:13:01,132 --> 00:13:03,851
Opening the National Union
of Public Employers meeting.

238
00:13:04,012 --> 00:13:06,367
- Anotherspeech...
- Wait a minute...

239
00:13:06,532 --> 00:13:09,444
- What about all the otherthings?
- What otherthings?

240
00:13:09,612 --> 00:13:11,728
I'm on fourpolicy committees
forthe party.

241
00:13:11,892 --> 00:13:14,884
You won'twant to be putting
partybefore country.

242
00:13:15,612 --> 00:13:17,125
No, no, of course not.

243
00:13:17,292 --> 00:13:20,170
I'll just fetch yourboxes,
Minister.

244
00:13:20,332 --> 00:13:21,526
Boxes? Already.

245
00:13:21,692 --> 00:13:25,480
The last Ministerhad some work
throughout the campaign,

246
00:13:25,652 --> 00:13:28,883
but I fear... well,
it's not forme to criticise...

247
00:13:29,052 --> 00:13:32,328
- What do you mean?
- It's a harsh thing to say.

248
00:13:32,492 --> 00:13:37,247
Some of the boxes actually came
back with the work not done.

249
00:13:39,212 --> 00:13:41,407
If you complete the first four
by Saturday,

250
00:13:41,572 --> 00:13:44,211
yourdriverwill deliver
the othertwo.

251
00:13:47,092 --> 00:13:48,491
Villa's at home to Liverpool.

252
00:13:48,652 --> 00:13:50,768
And I've got a surgery
on Saturday.

253
00:13:50,932 --> 00:13:54,720
If we minimise it, you need only
take the majorpolicy decisions.

254
00:13:54,892 --> 00:13:58,407
No, no. No. No. I take
all the decisions round here.

255
00:13:58,572 --> 00:14:02,201
Now then what time
shall I come in on Monday?

256
00:14:02,372 --> 00:14:04,442
You'll catch the 7.45 train
from New Street,

257
00:14:04,612 --> 00:14:07,331
and yourdriver
will meet you at Euston.

258
00:14:07,492 --> 00:14:10,529
If I could just put in
these draft proposals.

259
00:14:10,692 --> 00:14:13,684
And here, this is yourkey,
Minister.

260
00:14:13,852 --> 00:14:15,729
Out of my way.
I've had enough of this.

261
00:14:15,892 --> 00:14:17,962
- You can't go in there.
- Just try and stop me.

262
00:14:18,132 --> 00:14:21,010
- Jim, what's going on?
- Frank, where've you been?

263
00:14:21,172 --> 00:14:24,721
- Stuck in the waiting room.
- We are in private conference.

264
00:14:24,892 --> 00:14:28,009
- Then I should be here, too.
- Calm down, Frank.

265
00:14:28,172 --> 00:14:31,721
Humphrey, Frank has got
to have an office ofhis own.

266
00:14:31,892 --> 00:14:33,723
- Certainly, if you insist.
- I do insist.

267
00:14:33,892 --> 00:14:38,522
I do think we have some spare
office space in Walthamstow.

268
00:14:40,852 --> 00:14:42,968
- Walthamstow?
- Yes, it's surprising.

269
00:14:43,132 --> 00:14:45,009
The Government owns property
all over London.

270
00:14:45,172 --> 00:14:47,845
- I don'twant to be there.
- It's in a very nice part.

271
00:14:48,012 --> 00:14:51,084
Walthamstow's
a very nice place so I gather.

272
00:14:51,252 --> 00:14:53,163
- I need an office here.
- Why's that?

273
00:14:53,332 --> 00:14:54,970
Yes, I agree with Frank.

274
00:14:55,332 --> 00:14:58,324
Bernard, we must find
an office here for Mr. Weasel.

275
00:14:58,492 --> 00:14:59,845
Wiesel.

276
00:15:01,212 --> 00:15:03,885
Copies of all the papers
that come to me go to Frank.

277
00:15:04,052 --> 00:15:05,052
- All?
- All.

278
00:15:05,212 --> 00:15:06,884
It shall be done.

279
00:15:07,052 --> 00:15:09,441
All the appropriate papers.

280
00:15:18,812 --> 00:15:20,882
How's yournew Minister,
Humphrey?

281
00:15:21,052 --> 00:15:23,361
Learning the rules
very quicklyfora newboy.

282
00:15:23,532 --> 00:15:25,727
- How's yournew Cabinet?
- No problem.

283
00:15:25,892 --> 00:15:27,962
Similarto the last one.

284
00:15:29,012 --> 00:15:32,607
Arnold, I hearthe American
Ambassador's been spending

285
00:15:32,772 --> 00:15:34,922
a lot of time with the PM.

286
00:15:35,092 --> 00:15:36,844
- Yes.
- Defence ortrade?

287
00:15:37,012 --> 00:15:38,127
Both.

288
00:15:38,292 --> 00:15:40,248
The aerospace systems contract?

289
00:15:40,412 --> 00:15:43,563
Ssh. Don'twant the cabinet
to hearabout it yet.

290
00:15:43,732 --> 00:15:47,645
This aerospace thingumy would be

291
00:15:47,812 --> 00:15:50,167
rathera coup forthe PM,
wouldn't it?

292
00:15:50,332 --> 00:15:53,642
Yes, now the new PM
will take the credit.

293
00:15:53,812 --> 00:15:56,167
Sorry to intrude SirArnold,
Sir Humphrey,

294
00:15:56,332 --> 00:15:59,005
if you could just OK
the Minister's speech,

295
00:15:59,172 --> 00:16:00,969
I can get it
straight to the House.

296
00:16:01,132 --> 00:16:03,521
Yes, of course. Like to join us?

297
00:16:03,692 --> 00:16:07,207
Oh, thank you,
so long as I'm not too long.

298
00:16:07,372 --> 00:16:09,363
Get yourself a cup of coffee.

299
00:16:13,252 --> 00:16:16,324
So itwould be rather
an embarrassment to the PM,

300
00:16:16,492 --> 00:16:20,485
wouldn't it? if a hypothetical
Ministerwere to rock

301
00:16:20,652 --> 00:16:22,643
the Anglo American boat?

302
00:16:22,812 --> 00:16:24,404
Grave embarrassment.

303
00:16:24,572 --> 00:16:25,721
How grave?

304
00:16:25,892 --> 00:16:28,167
Man overboard, I should think.

305
00:16:28,692 --> 00:16:32,924
Enough to cut short a promising
new Ministerial career?

306
00:16:33,092 --> 00:16:34,684
No question.

307
00:16:40,052 --> 00:16:41,610
Pull up a chair, Bernard...

308
00:16:41,772 --> 00:16:45,526
And tell us what you think
of ournew Minister.

309
00:16:45,692 --> 00:16:47,444
Well absolutelyfine.

310
00:16:47,612 --> 00:16:51,890
Yes, we'll have him
housetrained in no time.

311
00:16:52,292 --> 00:16:54,089
He swallowed the whole diary,

312
00:16:54,252 --> 00:16:57,130
and I gatherhe did his boxes
like a lamb lastweekend?

313
00:16:57,292 --> 00:16:58,327
Yes. Yes he did.

314
00:16:58,492 --> 00:17:01,131
We must head him off
this Open Government nonsense.

315
00:17:01,452 --> 00:17:04,444
We were calling the White Paper
"Open Government".

316
00:17:04,612 --> 00:17:07,684
Always dispose of the difficult bit
in the title.

317
00:17:07,852 --> 00:17:10,082
Does less harm there
than in the text.

318
00:17:10,252 --> 00:17:12,561
The less you intend
to do about something,

319
00:17:12,732 --> 00:17:14,723
the more you have
to talk about it.

320
00:17:14,892 --> 00:17:17,281
What's wrong
with open government?

321
00:17:17,452 --> 00:17:20,603
Why shouldn't the public know
more about what's going on?

322
00:17:21,132 --> 00:17:23,009
Are you serious?

323
00:17:24,332 --> 00:17:28,120
Well, I mean it's
the Minister's policy, afterall.

324
00:17:28,292 --> 00:17:30,522
It's a contradiction in terms.

325
00:17:30,692 --> 00:17:32,967
You can be open
oryou can have government.

326
00:17:33,132 --> 00:17:38,445
But surely the citizens of a
democracy have a right to know.

327
00:17:38,612 --> 00:17:41,922
No. They have a right
to be ignorant.

328
00:17:42,532 --> 00:17:44,488
Knowledge only means
complicity and guilt.

329
00:17:44,652 --> 00:17:46,688
Ignorance has a certain dignity.

330
00:17:46,852 --> 00:17:48,444
But if the Ministerwants...

331
00:17:48,612 --> 00:17:50,682
You don't just give people
what they want,

332
00:17:50,852 --> 00:17:52,604
if it's not good forthem.

333
00:17:52,772 --> 00:17:55,525
Do you give brandy
to an alcoholic?

334
00:17:56,252 --> 00:17:59,608
Thatway people don't know
what you are doing wrong.

335
00:18:02,172 --> 00:18:05,926
I am the Minister's Private
Secretary, and ifhe wants...

336
00:18:06,092 --> 00:18:10,165
You must not help him
to make a fool ofhimself.

337
00:18:10,332 --> 00:18:12,129
Look at the Ministers we've had.

338
00:18:12,292 --> 00:18:15,284
They would have been
a laughing stock

339
00:18:15,452 --> 00:18:19,843
had it not been forthe most rigid
secrecy about theirdoings.

340
00:18:20,412 --> 00:18:22,448
What do you propose to do?

341
00:18:24,052 --> 00:18:26,441
- Can you keep a secret?
- Of course.

342
00:18:30,692 --> 00:18:32,410
So can I.

343
00:18:33,252 --> 00:18:36,085
Excuse me,
I have to make a phone call.

344
00:18:38,012 --> 00:18:42,210
Well, I'd betterbe getting
this back to the Minister.

345
00:18:44,812 --> 00:18:48,282
Martin. Has the weasel
had a copy of the invoice

346
00:18:48,452 --> 00:18:50,807
forthe new American
addressing machines?

347
00:18:50,972 --> 00:18:53,167
I thought you said
it was sensitive.

348
00:18:53,332 --> 00:18:55,607
So it is.
Get it to him today.

349
00:18:55,772 --> 00:19:00,800
Oh, and Martin, let him find it
nearthe bottom of the pile.

350
00:19:06,332 --> 00:19:07,606
Jim, Jim.

351
00:19:07,772 --> 00:19:09,603
- Yes.
- Look what I've found.

352
00:19:09,852 --> 00:19:13,242
We've got them
by the short and curlies.

353
00:19:13,412 --> 00:19:16,006
We've got Sir Humphrey
Bloody Appleby

354
00:19:16,172 --> 00:19:18,322
and Mr. Toffee Nosed
Snooty Wolley

355
00:19:18,492 --> 00:19:20,960
just where we want them.
See this?

356
00:19:21,132 --> 00:19:23,362
This innocent-looking
piece of paper.

357
00:19:23,532 --> 00:19:25,409
Political dynamite.

358
00:19:25,572 --> 00:19:28,132
Calm down.
What are you talking about?

359
00:19:29,172 --> 00:19:33,848
This is an invoice for 1.000
computervideo display terminals.

360
00:19:34,012 --> 00:19:38,290
At 10.000 pounds each,
that is, ten milion pounds.

361
00:19:38,452 --> 00:19:39,965
So?

362
00:19:40,612 --> 00:19:44,730
Made by the Pittsburgh
Manufacturing Corporation Inc.,

363
00:19:44,892 --> 00:19:47,611
- Imported from America?
- I know.

364
00:19:47,772 --> 00:19:50,332
Butwe make computerperipherals
in this country.

365
00:19:50,492 --> 00:19:52,960
- In my constituency.
- I know!

366
00:19:53,252 --> 00:19:55,447
- What about unemployment?
- I know!

367
00:19:56,332 --> 00:19:58,129
This must be stopped.

368
00:20:01,292 --> 00:20:04,489
- Sir Humphrey to see... oh sorry.
- Oh no. No, come in.

369
00:20:04,652 --> 00:20:06,768
I want to see you both, come on.

370
00:20:06,932 --> 00:20:08,570
Sir Humphrey, take a seat.

371
00:20:08,732 --> 00:20:10,051
Thank you, Minister.

372
00:20:10,212 --> 00:20:13,966
Now then, Frank here
has just discovered this contract

373
00:20:14,132 --> 00:20:16,885
forthe import
of ten million pound's worth

374
00:20:17,052 --> 00:20:19,361
of video display terminals,
from America.

375
00:20:19,532 --> 00:20:21,124
May I see?

376
00:20:23,772 --> 00:20:27,003
Oh yes. Forthe whole
Civil Service in Whitehall.

377
00:20:27,532 --> 00:20:30,046
- But they're not British.
- That is true.

378
00:20:30,372 --> 00:20:33,250
- We make them in this country.
- Not of the same quality.

379
00:20:33,412 --> 00:20:36,085
Betterquality.
In my constituency.

380
00:20:36,812 --> 00:20:40,441
- We were advised...
- This contract must be stopped.

381
00:20:40,612 --> 00:20:44,730
It's beyond my power. This can
only be cancelled by the Treasury.

382
00:20:44,892 --> 00:20:45,927
Why's that?

383
00:20:46,092 --> 00:20:49,129
Would be a majorpolicy change
forthe Civil Service

384
00:20:49,292 --> 00:20:52,489
to cancel contracts, especially
with overseas suppliers.

385
00:20:52,652 --> 00:20:54,324
If you'd like to take it up
with the Cabinet.

386
00:20:54,492 --> 00:20:57,211
How am I to face
my constituency party?

387
00:20:57,692 --> 00:20:59,683
Why need they know?

388
00:20:59,932 --> 00:21:02,127
Why need anybody know?

389
00:21:03,052 --> 00:21:05,282
We can see that it nevergets out.

390
00:21:05,452 --> 00:21:08,046
- Open Government.
- That's right.

391
00:21:08,212 --> 00:21:11,204
- It must be published.
- That's right.

392
00:21:12,132 --> 00:21:13,360
Why?

393
00:21:13,732 --> 00:21:15,370
Well... er...

394
00:21:16,012 --> 00:21:18,048
- Why, Frank?
- The manifesto.

395
00:21:18,212 --> 00:21:20,601
And yourpredecessor
will look like a traitor.

396
00:21:20,772 --> 00:21:24,003
- Two unanswerable reasons.
- You didn't bargain forthis!

397
00:21:24,172 --> 00:21:25,764
You're not suggesting

398
00:21:25,932 --> 00:21:29,561
that the Ministershould make
a positive reference

399
00:21:29,732 --> 00:21:33,122
to this confidential transaction
in a speech?

400
00:21:33,892 --> 00:21:35,450
Speech. That's it.

401
00:21:35,612 --> 00:21:39,969
Jim, what about the speech
to the Union of office Employees?

402
00:21:40,132 --> 00:21:42,930
I'll tell them about
this scandalous contract.

403
00:21:43,092 --> 00:21:44,923
And we'll release it
to the press today.

404
00:21:45,092 --> 00:21:47,083
- Who's running the country now?
- Well... yes.

405
00:21:47,252 --> 00:21:49,208
- You object?
- It might be regrettable,

406
00:21:49,372 --> 00:21:52,250
- if we upset the Americans.
- The Americans.

407
00:21:52,412 --> 00:21:55,165
It's time they lose
theircommercial complacency.

408
00:21:55,332 --> 00:21:59,086
We must think of the British
poor, not the American rich!

409
00:21:59,252 --> 00:22:01,049
If that is yourexpress wish,

410
00:22:01,212 --> 00:22:04,170
the Departmentwill back you,
up to the hilt.

411
00:22:04,332 --> 00:22:05,651
That is my express wish.

412
00:22:05,812 --> 00:22:08,929
I'd bettercirculate
the speech forclearance.

413
00:22:09,092 --> 00:22:11,322
It does not involve
any otherdepartment.

414
00:22:11,492 --> 00:22:15,849
Open Government demands
thatwe include ourcolleagues,

415
00:22:16,012 --> 00:22:18,367
as well as ourfriends
in Fleet Street.

416
00:22:18,532 --> 00:22:21,285
- Oh yes, that's fairenough.
- I'm not sure.

417
00:22:21,452 --> 00:22:23,647
Thank you. And Humphrey...

418
00:22:23,812 --> 00:22:26,201
See that goes
straight to the press.

419
00:22:27,012 --> 00:22:29,731
We shall serve
yourbest interests.

420
00:22:30,652 --> 00:22:31,687
Thank you.

421
00:22:32,732 --> 00:22:34,165
Now then...

422
00:22:35,172 --> 00:22:36,924
Let me see.

423
00:22:38,532 --> 00:22:43,526
We've made a pledge to the
people about open government.

424
00:22:43,692 --> 00:22:45,569
So let's have some.

425
00:22:45,732 --> 00:22:48,963
I have discovered
that the previous government

426
00:22:49,132 --> 00:22:52,807
signed a contract to import
office equipment

427
00:22:52,972 --> 00:22:55,725
- foruse by the Civil Service...
- Bureaucracy!

428
00:22:55,892 --> 00:22:58,281
Used by the Civil Service
bureaucracy.

429
00:22:58,452 --> 00:23:02,001
So, we are being fobbed off
with second rate American junk

430
00:23:02,172 --> 00:23:04,925
by smart Aleck salesmen
from Pittsburgh

431
00:23:05,092 --> 00:23:07,526
while British factories
stand empty

432
00:23:07,692 --> 00:23:10,525
and British workmen
queue up forthe dole.

433
00:23:10,692 --> 00:23:14,401
- Unemployment benefit.
- The dole, Bernard.

434
00:23:15,892 --> 00:23:20,249
"Much as I personally value
the friendship of ourgreat cousins

435
00:23:20,412 --> 00:23:22,368
from across the sea".

436
00:23:31,990 --> 00:23:34,220
- Minister, something's come up.
- Yes?

437
00:23:34,390 --> 00:23:36,950
- A minute from the PM's Office.
- I'm prettybusy.

438
00:23:37,110 --> 00:23:39,544
- You ought to read this.
- What does it say?

439
00:23:39,710 --> 00:23:42,622
The PM is planning
a visit to Washington

440
00:23:42,790 --> 00:23:46,863
fora valuable Anglo American
defence trade agreement.

441
00:23:47,030 --> 00:23:49,669
Its importance
cannot be overestimated.

442
00:23:49,830 --> 00:23:52,219
Fine. Has my speech gone
to the press?

443
00:23:52,390 --> 00:23:54,506
I presume so, as you requested.

444
00:23:55,030 --> 00:23:58,545
I'm sorry, but all hell's just
broken loose at NumberTen.

445
00:23:58,710 --> 00:24:01,543
They're asking why yourspeech
didn't obtain clearance.

446
00:24:01,710 --> 00:24:04,270
- What did you say?
- I mentioned open government.

447
00:24:04,430 --> 00:24:06,819
But it seemed
to make things worse.

448
00:24:06,990 --> 00:24:09,948
The PM wants to see you
in the House, right away.

449
00:24:23,030 --> 00:24:24,941
What's going to happen?

450
00:24:26,110 --> 00:24:29,261
The Prime Ministergiveth
and he taketh away.

451
00:24:32,310 --> 00:24:35,382
Blessed be the name
of the Prime Minister.

452
00:24:51,190 --> 00:24:52,464
Hello, Vic...

453
00:24:52,630 --> 00:24:55,224
Sir Humphrey Appleby,
Vic Gould, ourChiefWhip.

454
00:24:55,390 --> 00:24:58,188
You really are a pain in the arse.

455
00:24:59,710 --> 00:25:01,587
The PM's going up the wall.

456
00:25:01,750 --> 00:25:02,978
Hitting the roof.

457
00:25:03,150 --> 00:25:05,789
You can't go around
making speeches like that.

458
00:25:06,110 --> 00:25:07,748
It's Open Government.

459
00:25:07,910 --> 00:25:10,344
- Shut up, Weasel.
- Wiesel!

460
00:25:10,510 --> 00:25:13,661
But Open Governmentwas
the main plank in ourmanifesto.

461
00:25:13,830 --> 00:25:17,106
- The PM believes in it too.
- Open, yes. But not gaping.

462
00:25:17,270 --> 00:25:21,229
In politics you have to say things
with tact, you berk!

463
00:25:22,150 --> 00:25:24,141
And when to say nothing at all.

464
00:25:24,310 --> 00:25:27,063
- How long you been a Minister?
- Week and half.

465
00:25:27,670 --> 00:25:30,946
You will appear
in the Guinness book of records.

466
00:25:32,030 --> 00:25:33,907
I can see the headlines already.

467
00:25:34,070 --> 00:25:36,061
"Cabinet split on U. S. Trade.

468
00:25:36,230 --> 00:25:38,824
Hacker leads revolt
against Prime Minister.

469
00:25:38,990 --> 00:25:40,946
That's what you want, is it?

470
00:25:42,910 --> 00:25:46,141
Ah, SirArnold, what news?

471
00:25:46,310 --> 00:25:48,870
That speech is causing
the PM some distress.

472
00:25:49,030 --> 00:25:51,066
Has it been released
to the Press?

473
00:25:51,230 --> 00:25:55,018
Well, the Ministergave
express instructions fornoon.

474
00:25:55,190 --> 00:25:57,624
- Isn't that right?
- I'm appalled at you, Humphrey.

475
00:25:57,790 --> 00:26:01,942
How could you let the Minister
put himself in this position?

476
00:26:02,110 --> 00:26:04,066
We believe in open government.

477
00:26:04,230 --> 00:26:08,064
We want to open the windows.
Isn't that right, Minister?

478
00:26:08,230 --> 00:26:09,709
It's good party stuff,

479
00:26:09,870 --> 00:26:13,226
but it puts the PM
in a very difficult situation.

480
00:26:13,390 --> 00:26:15,267
What about Open Government?

481
00:26:15,670 --> 00:26:19,299
This seems to be the closed season
foropen government.

482
00:26:20,670 --> 00:26:23,662
Do you want to give thought

483
00:26:23,830 --> 00:26:26,344
to a draft letterof resignation?

484
00:26:26,510 --> 00:26:27,738
Just in case...

485
00:26:30,910 --> 00:26:33,060
Can'twe hush it up?

486
00:26:33,510 --> 00:26:36,661
- Hush it up?
- Yes, hush it up.

487
00:26:38,390 --> 00:26:40,221
You mean... suppress it?

488
00:26:40,430 --> 00:26:41,943
Yes, I suppose I do.

489
00:26:42,110 --> 00:26:45,500
You mean thatwithin
the framework of the guidelines

490
00:26:45,670 --> 00:26:48,787
about open goverment
that you have laid down,

491
00:26:48,950 --> 00:26:52,226
you're suggesting we should
adopt a more flexible posture?

492
00:26:52,390 --> 00:26:54,585
Am I? Oh yes. Yes.

493
00:26:54,750 --> 00:26:56,786
About the press release...

494
00:26:56,950 --> 00:27:01,023
A development could precipitate
a reappraisal of ourposition.

495
00:27:01,190 --> 00:27:04,944
We forgot the interdepartmental
clearance procedure.

496
00:27:05,590 --> 00:27:08,502
The supplementary stop order
came into effect.

497
00:27:08,990 --> 00:27:12,346
So, yourspeech
hasn't gone to the Press.

498
00:27:13,830 --> 00:27:16,344
It's only gone
to the PM's Private Office

499
00:27:16,510 --> 00:27:20,298
and the Duty Officerhad
no instructions to pass it out

500
00:27:20,470 --> 00:27:23,109
- without clearance.
- But how come?

501
00:27:24,150 --> 00:27:26,744
The fault is entirely mine, Minister.

502
00:27:27,390 --> 00:27:30,666
The holding up
of press releases dates back to

503
00:27:30,830 --> 00:27:32,786
before open government,

504
00:27:32,950 --> 00:27:35,862
and I unaccountably omitted
to rescind it.

505
00:27:36,350 --> 00:27:40,502
- I hope you forgive this lapse.
- Well, yes, of course.

506
00:27:41,430 --> 00:27:44,342
- That's quite all right.
- Thank you, Minister.

507
00:27:44,510 --> 00:27:46,660
Afterall, we all make mistakes.

508
00:27:47,350 --> 00:27:48,783
Yes, Minister.
