1
00:01:59,440 --> 00:02:00,839
Hello, Mr Herriot.

1
00:01:59,440 --> 00:02:00,839
你好，赫里奥特先生。

2
00:02:00,840 --> 00:02:04,599
Hello, Tom. Good of you to
help out the Dalbys like this.

2
00:02:00,840 --> 00:02:04,599
你好，汤姆。你能
像这样帮助达尔比一家，真是太好了。

3
00:02:04,600 --> 00:02:07,279
They've always been good
friends of my grandparents.

3
00:02:04,600 --> 00:02:07,279
他们一直是
我祖父母的好朋友。

4
00:02:07,280 --> 00:02:09,480
Mrs Dalby's up in t' field.
I'll take you.

4
00:02:07,280 --> 00:02:09,480
达尔比夫人在田野里。
我带你去。

5
00:02:21,280 --> 00:02:22,480
Thanks, Tom.

5
00:02:21,280 --> 00:02:22,480
谢谢，汤姆。

6
00:02:24,520 --> 00:02:25,839
Morning, Mr Herriot.

6
00:02:24,520 --> 00:02:25,839
早上好，赫里奥特先生。

7
00:02:25,840 --> 00:02:27,719
Thanks for coming out to see us.

7
00:02:25,840 --> 00:02:27,719
谢谢你出来见我们。

8
00:02:27,720 --> 00:02:30,639
And thank you for
being there yesterday.

8
00:02:27,720 --> 00:02:30,639
谢谢你
昨天在场。

9
00:02:30,640 --> 00:02:32,239
Billy was a good man.

9
00:02:30,640 --> 00:02:32,239
比利是个好人。

10
00:02:32,240 --> 00:02:34,439
I wanted to pay my respects.

10
00:02:32,240 --> 00:02:34,439
我想表达我的敬意。

11
00:02:36,440 --> 00:02:39,279
Their breathing don't
sound right, Mr Herriot.

11
00:02:36,440 --> 00:02:39,279
他们的呼吸
听起来不太对劲，赫里奥特先生。

12
00:02:39,280 --> 00:02:42,199
They were really fit when they
turned out earlier this month.

12
00:02:39,280 --> 00:02:42,199
当他们
本月早些时候出现时，他们真的很健康。

13
00:02:42,200 --> 00:02:44,120
Then, well...

13
00:02:42,200 --> 00:02:44,120
那么，嗯...

14
00:02:45,920 --> 00:02:47,760
Let's have a look, then, shall we?

14
00:02:45,920 --> 00:02:47,760
那我们来看看好吗？

15
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:16,199
The stirks have got husk, I'm afraid.

15
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:16,199
马镫有壳了，恐怕。

16
00:03:16,200 --> 00:03:18,479
For an older cow
this may not be our problem

16
00:03:16,200 --> 00:03:18,479
对于一头老母牛，
这可能不是我们的问题

17
00:03:18,480 --> 00:03:19,959
but as they are still so young...

17
00:03:18,480 --> 00:03:19,959
但因为他们还那么年轻......

18
00:03:19,960 --> 00:03:22,879
Aye, and what is husk, exactly?

18
00:03:19,960 --> 00:03:22,879
是的，什么是外壳？

19
00:03:22,880 --> 00:03:24,439
Well, it's a parasite.

19
00:03:22,880 --> 00:03:24,439
嗯，是寄生虫。

20
00:03:24,440 --> 00:03:26,839
A tiny worm which infests
the bronchial tubes

20
00:03:24,440 --> 00:03:26,839
一种感染
支气管的小蠕虫

21
00:03:26,840 --> 00:03:28,999
and sets up bronchitis.

21
00:03:26,840 --> 00:03:28,999
并引发支气管炎。

22
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:31,039
The larvae climb up the blades of grass

22
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:31,039
幼虫爬上草叶

23
00:03:31,040 --> 00:03:34,039
and the cattle eat them as they graze.

23
00:03:31,040 --> 00:03:34,039
牛在吃草时吃掉它们。

24
00:03:34,040 --> 00:03:36,240
Some pastures are badly
affected with it.

24
00:03:34,040 --> 00:03:36,240
一些牧场受到严重
影响。

25
00:03:38,440 --> 00:03:41,559
I'm sorry but they're pretty bad,
Mrs Dalby.

25
00:03:38,440 --> 00:03:41,559
对不起，他们很糟糕，
达尔比夫人。

26
00:03:41,560 --> 00:03:42,720
A mild attack isn't so bad

26
00:03:41,560 --> 00:03:42,720
轻微的攻击并没有那么糟糕

27
00:03:42,721 --> 00:03:44,639
if you can get them
off the grass right away

27
00:03:42,721 --> 00:03:44,639
如果你能
马上把它们从草地上弄下来

28
00:03:44,640 --> 00:03:48,239
but this has gone
a long way beyond that.

28
00:03:44,640 --> 00:03:48,239
但这
远远不止于此。

29
00:03:48,240 --> 00:03:50,199
What can we do about it, Mr Herriot?

29
00:03:48,240 --> 00:03:50,199
我们能做些什么，赫里奥特先生？

30
00:03:50,200 --> 00:03:52,679
For a start, we can get them
all inside immediately.

30
00:03:50,200 --> 00:03:52,679
首先，我们可以
立即将它们全部放入。

31
00:03:52,680 --> 00:03:55,519
Every mouthful of this grass
is adding to the worm burden.

31
00:03:52,680 --> 00:03:55,519
每一口这种草
都增加了蠕虫的负担。

32
00:03:55,520 --> 00:03:57,320
Right you are, Mr Herriot.

32
00:03:55,520 --> 00:03:57,320
你说得对，赫里奥特先生。

33
00:04:00,800 --> 00:04:05,239
Can I... tempt you with
the last egg, Mrs H?

33
00:04:00,800 --> 00:04:05,239
我可以……用
最后一个鸡蛋诱惑你吗，H 夫人？

34
00:04:05,240 --> 00:04:06,679
No thanks.

34
00:04:05,240 --> 00:04:06,679
不，谢谢。

35
00:04:06,680 --> 00:04:08,120
Seems a shame to waste it.

35
00:04:06,680 --> 00:04:08,120
浪费它似乎很可惜。

36
00:04:10,280 --> 00:04:12,199
I thought you'd be joining your friends

36
00:04:10,280 --> 00:04:12,199
我以为你会加入你的朋友

37
00:04:12,200 --> 00:04:13,799
down in London for the cricket.

37
00:04:12,200 --> 00:04:13,799
在伦敦打板球。

38
00:04:13,800 --> 00:04:15,079
Yes, I thought so too

38
00:04:13,800 --> 00:04:15,079
是的，我也是这么想的

39
00:04:15,080 --> 00:04:19,079
but unfortunately tickets require
money and money requires wages,

39
00:04:15,080 --> 00:04:19,079
但不幸的是门票需要
钱，钱需要工资，

40
00:04:19,080 --> 00:04:20,959
neither of which I possess.

40
00:04:19,080 --> 00:04:20,959
这两个我都不拥有。

41
00:04:20,960 --> 00:04:23,839
So instead, my plan is
three uninterrupted days

41
00:04:20,960 --> 00:04:23,839
所以相反，我的计划是
三天不间断

42
00:04:23,840 --> 00:04:26,599
with my feet up, the radio on
and a lovely, cool glass of...

42
00:04:23,840 --> 00:04:26,599
抬起脚，打开收音机
，喝一杯可爱、凉爽的...

43
00:04:26,600 --> 00:04:28,799
Well, it took all of five hours

43
00:04:26,600 --> 00:04:28,799
嗯，花了五个小时

44
00:04:28,800 --> 00:04:31,319
but Gladys produced
a whopping 18 piglets.

44
00:04:28,800 --> 00:04:31,319
但是格拉迪斯生产
了多达 18 头小猪。

45
00:04:31,320 --> 00:04:33,159
Darrowby record, I believe.

45
00:04:31,320 --> 00:04:33,159
达罗比记录，我相信。

46
00:04:33,160 --> 00:04:34,839
Smells like one, too.

46
00:04:33,160 --> 00:04:34,839
闻起来也很像。

47
00:04:34,840 --> 00:04:37,239
They need cleaning. Get them off.

47
00:04:34,840 --> 00:04:37,239
他们需要清洁。把他们弄下来。

48
00:04:37,240 --> 00:04:38,519
Any chance of some breakfast?

48
00:04:37,240 --> 00:04:38,519
有机会吃早餐吗？

49
00:04:38,520 --> 00:04:40,839
I can make you a bacon sandwich.
And those.

49
00:04:38,520 --> 00:04:40,839
我可以给你做一个培根三明治。
以及那些。

50
00:04:40,840 --> 00:04:43,400
Think I've had enough pig
for one day. Got any eggs?

50
00:04:40,840 --> 00:04:43,400
想想我已经吃够
了一天的猪了。有鸡蛋吗？

51
00:04:48,160 --> 00:04:50,359
You can have the rest
of this one if you like.

51
00:04:48,160 --> 00:04:50,359
如果你愿意，你可以拥有剩下的。

52
00:04:50,360 --> 00:04:52,519
So I'm out working my trousers off

52
00:04:50,360 --> 00:04:52,519
所以我要脱掉裤子

53
00:04:52,520 --> 00:04:56,799
while you're lazing around stuffing
your face with my hard-earned eggs?

53
00:04:52,520 --> 00:04:56,799
当你懒洋洋地
用我辛苦赚来的鸡蛋塞满你的脸时？

54
00:04:56,800 --> 00:04:59,039
Such is life, big brother.
Such is life.

54
00:04:56,800 --> 00:04:59,039
这就是生活，大哥。
这就是人生。

55
00:04:59,040 --> 00:05:01,959
Go and get changed.
I'll make you some toast.

55
00:04:59,040 --> 00:05:01,959
去换衣服。
我给你做些吐司。

56
00:05:04,480 --> 00:05:07,519
You really didn't need to go
to all this trouble. Nonsense.

56
00:05:04,480 --> 00:05:07,519
你真的没有必要
遇到这些麻烦。废话。

57
00:05:07,520 --> 00:05:10,439
I hope that tea isn't too
strong for you. It's perfect.

57
00:05:07,520 --> 00:05:10,439
我希望茶
对你来说不是太浓。这是完美的。

58
00:05:10,440 --> 00:05:12,119
Thank you, Mrs Dalby.

58
00:05:10,440 --> 00:05:12,119
谢谢你，达尔比夫人。

59
00:05:12,120 --> 00:05:14,399
I'll be back up tomorrow
to check on the stirks.

59
00:05:12,120 --> 00:05:14,399
明天我会回来
检查马鞭。

60
00:05:14,400 --> 00:05:17,439
Meanwhile, it's very important
that you keep them inside.

60
00:05:14,400 --> 00:05:17,439
同时，
将它们留在里面非常重要。

61
00:05:17,440 --> 00:05:20,079
Oh. But they'll need feeding.

61
00:05:17,440 --> 00:05:20,079
哦。但他们需要喂食。

62
00:05:20,080 --> 00:05:21,359
Well, at this point,

62
00:05:20,080 --> 00:05:21,359
那么，在这一点上，

63
00:05:21,360 --> 00:05:24,559
I would start by giving
them the best possible food -

63
00:05:21,360 --> 00:05:24,559
我会先给
他们最好的食物——

64
00:05:24,560 --> 00:05:27,799
good hay and high-protein cake.

64
00:05:24,560 --> 00:05:27,799
好干草和高蛋白蛋糕。

65
00:05:27,800 --> 00:05:29,959
Cake?

65
00:05:27,800 --> 00:05:29,959
蛋糕？

66
00:05:29,960 --> 00:05:31,879
That's expensive stuff, isn't it?

66
00:05:29,960 --> 00:05:31,879
那是很贵的东西，不是吗？

67
00:05:31,880 --> 00:05:35,159
And if we give them the hay now,
we'll need to buy more for winter.

67
00:05:31,880 --> 00:05:35,159
如果我们现在给他们干草，
我们将需要购买更多的干草过冬。

68
00:05:35,160 --> 00:05:38,679
I know but a good diet is
our best hope at this stage.

68
00:05:35,160 --> 00:05:38,679
我知道，但
在这个阶段，良好的饮食是我们最大的希望。

69
00:05:38,680 --> 00:05:41,999
And they can't go out to
feed on the grass ever?

69
00:05:38,680 --> 00:05:41,999
他们不能出去
吃草吗？

70
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:44,159
No. I'm sorry, not on those fields.

70
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:44,159
不，对不起，不在那些领域。

71
00:05:44,160 --> 00:05:46,799
If it was a mild attack,
you could have turned them out

71
00:05:44,160 --> 00:05:46,799
如果这是一次轻微的攻击，
你可以把它们赶出去

72
00:05:46,800 --> 00:05:48,999
after the dew had left in the mornings

72
00:05:46,800 --> 00:05:48,999
在早晨露水离开之后

73
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:50,360
but that's not the case here.

73
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:50,360
但这里的情况并非如此。

74
00:05:51,680 --> 00:05:53,439
Right.

74
00:05:51,680 --> 00:05:53,439
对。

75
00:05:53,440 --> 00:05:56,599
Well, thank you, Mr Herriot.
We know where we are anyway.

75
00:05:53,440 --> 00:05:56,599
嗯，谢谢你，赫里奥特先生。
无论如何，我们知道我们在哪里。

76
00:05:56,600 --> 00:05:59,679
Billy, love, why don't you take your
brother outside for a kickaround?

76
00:05:56,600 --> 00:05:59,679
比利，亲爱的，你为什么不带你
弟弟出去玩玩呢？

77
00:05:59,680 --> 00:06:01,879
Have we got a young
Gordon Hodgson in the making?

77
00:05:59,680 --> 00:06:01,879
我们有一个年轻的
戈登霍奇森吗？

78
00:06:01,880 --> 00:06:03,080
He's my favourite player.

78
00:06:01,880 --> 00:06:03,080
他是我最喜欢的球员。

79
00:06:03,080 --> 00:06:04,160
Good choice.

79
00:06:03,080 --> 00:06:04,160
好的选择。

80
00:06:04,160 --> 00:06:05,360
Go on, Billy, love.

80
00:06:04,160 --> 00:06:05,360
继续，比利，亲爱的。

81
00:06:06,880 --> 00:06:08,319
Oi, you.

81
00:06:06,880 --> 00:06:08,319
Oi, you.

82
00:06:08,320 --> 00:06:10,519
Excuse me.

82
00:06:08,320 --> 00:06:10,519
打扰一下。

83
00:06:10,520 --> 00:06:11,480
Come on.

83
00:06:10,520 --> 00:06:11,480
来吧。

84
00:06:11,481 --> 00:06:12,760
So cheeky.

84
00:06:11,481 --> 00:06:12,760
好厚脸皮

85
00:06:17,040 --> 00:06:19,199
Do you think we can save them?

85
00:06:17,040 --> 00:06:19,199
你觉得我们能救他们吗？

86
00:06:19,200 --> 00:06:21,360
Well... we can always hope.

86
00:06:19,200 --> 00:06:21,360
嗯……我们总是可以希望的。

87
00:06:23,680 --> 00:06:25,639
Funny.

87
00:06:23,680 --> 00:06:25,639
有趣的。

88
00:06:25,640 --> 00:06:27,920
That's what my Billy
always used to say.

88
00:06:25,640 --> 00:06:27,920
这就是我的比利
经常说的话。

89
00:06:29,280 --> 00:06:31,599
He was ever the optimist.

89
00:06:29,280 --> 00:06:31,599
他一直是个乐观主义者。

90
00:06:31,600 --> 00:06:33,359
Even when the doctor
said it was cancer,

90
00:06:31,600 --> 00:06:33,359
即使医生
说是癌症，

91
00:06:33,360 --> 00:06:35,120
Billy still insisted he'd be fine.

91
00:06:33,360 --> 00:06:35,120
比利仍然坚持他会没事的。

92
00:06:39,720 --> 00:06:42,160
Time is so fleeting, Mr Herriot.

92
00:06:39,720 --> 00:06:42,160
时间太快了，赫里奥先生。

93
00:06:49,640 --> 00:06:51,319
Any other calls come in?

93
00:06:49,640 --> 00:06:51,319
还有其他电话打进来吗？

94
00:06:51,320 --> 00:06:52,520
Nothing.

94
00:06:51,320 --> 00:06:52,520
没有。

95
00:06:53,920 --> 00:06:55,199
Shame.

95
00:06:53,920 --> 00:06:55,199
耻辱。

96
00:06:55,200 --> 00:06:58,319
I guess we will be taking a day off.
Not so fast.

96
00:06:55,200 --> 00:06:58,319
我想我们会请一天假。
没那么快。

97
00:06:58,320 --> 00:06:59,999
Equipment needs polishing. Done.

97
00:06:58,320 --> 00:06:59,999
设备需要抛光。完毕。

98
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:02,279
Well, then, the medicines
need topping up. Done.

98
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:02,279
那么，药物
需要补充。完毕。

99
00:07:02,280 --> 00:07:04,839
All done. Play starts
in five minutes, Mrs H.

99
00:07:02,280 --> 00:07:04,839
全部完成。比赛
在五分钟后开始，H 夫人。

100
00:07:04,840 --> 00:07:07,679
Wait a minute. Wait a minute.
What about the...?

100
00:07:04,840 --> 00:07:07,679
等一下。等一下。
怎么样...？

101
00:07:07,680 --> 00:07:10,439
What's wrong with Tristan
enjoying the cricket?

101
00:07:07,680 --> 00:07:10,439
特里斯坦
喜欢板球有什么问题？

102
00:07:10,440 --> 00:07:13,479
He spent all last night
polishing and topping things up.

102
00:07:10,440 --> 00:07:13,479
他昨晚花了一整晚的时间
打磨和补足东西。

103
00:07:13,480 --> 00:07:14,879
There's always more to be done.

103
00:07:13,480 --> 00:07:14,879
总是有更多的事情要做。

104
00:07:14,880 --> 00:07:17,359
Lambing season's almost over.

104
00:07:14,880 --> 00:07:17,359
羔羊季节快结束了。

105
00:07:17,360 --> 00:07:19,359
Summer's our quietest time of year.

105
00:07:17,360 --> 00:07:19,359
夏天是我们一年中最安静的时候。

106
00:07:19,360 --> 00:07:22,479
Surely the lad's earned
a day or two off now.

106
00:07:19,360 --> 00:07:22,479
这小伙子
现在肯定休息了一两天。

107
00:07:22,480 --> 00:07:23,520
Earned?

107
00:07:22,480 --> 00:07:23,520
赚了？

108
00:07:23,521 --> 00:07:26,600
Well, now he's passed
his exams and all.

108
00:07:23,521 --> 00:07:26,600
好吧，现在他已经通过
了考试。

109
00:07:49,200 --> 00:07:50,599
Oh!

109
00:07:49,200 --> 00:07:50,599
哦！

110
00:07:50,600 --> 00:07:53,279
James, I'm so sorry.
I didn't see you there.

110
00:07:50,600 --> 00:07:53,279
詹姆斯，我很抱歉。
我没有在那里看到你。

111
00:07:53,280 --> 00:07:55,120
I've probably had worse flung at me.

111
00:07:53,280 --> 00:07:55,120
我可能遭受了更糟糕的事情。

112
00:07:56,600 --> 00:08:00,159
I wanted to drop in and see
how you were after yesterday.

112
00:07:56,600 --> 00:08:00,159
我想进去看看
你昨天过得怎么样。

113
00:08:00,160 --> 00:08:02,319
Oh, I'm all right, thanks.

113
00:08:00,160 --> 00:08:02,319
哦，我没事，谢谢。

114
00:08:02,320 --> 00:08:04,959
It's Phyllis we're worried about.

114
00:08:02,320 --> 00:08:04,959
我们担心的是菲利斯。

115
00:08:04,960 --> 00:08:06,999
I was just over there now.

115
00:08:04,960 --> 00:08:06,999
我现在刚好在那儿。

116
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:08,879
Her stirks have got husk.

116
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:08,879
在这里搅拌已经记住了。

117
00:08:08,880 --> 00:08:11,759
Oh, on top of everything else.

117
00:08:08,880 --> 00:08:11,759
哦，在其他一切之上。

118
00:08:11,760 --> 00:08:13,759
We offered to help
her out with the kids

118
00:08:11,760 --> 00:08:13,759
我们主动提出要帮
她带孩子

119
00:08:13,760 --> 00:08:15,640
but she's determined she can manage.

119
00:08:13,760 --> 00:08:15,640
但她确定她可以应付。

120
00:08:16,960 --> 00:08:20,919
Our Jenny was around the same
age as Billy when my mam died.

120
00:08:16,960 --> 00:08:20,919
我
妈妈去世时，我们的珍妮和比利差不多大。

121
00:08:20,920 --> 00:08:23,520
All the things that family
never got to do together.

121
00:08:20,920 --> 00:08:23,520
家人
从来没有一起做的所有事情。

122
00:08:24,720 --> 00:08:26,759
Now they never will.

122
00:08:24,720 --> 00:08:26,759
现在他们永远不会。

123
00:08:26,760 --> 00:08:29,799
Must have brought back
a lot of painful memories.

123
00:08:26,760 --> 00:08:29,799
一定勾起
了很多痛苦的回忆。

124
00:08:29,800 --> 00:08:31,120
Life's cruel sometimes.

124
00:08:29,800 --> 00:08:31,120
生活有时很残酷。

125
00:08:36,040 --> 00:08:38,000
Be seeing you again soon? I hope so.

125
00:08:36,040 --> 00:08:38,000
很快又要见面了吗？但愿如此。

126
00:08:40,800 --> 00:08:42,719
What are you doing tomorrow night?

126
00:08:40,800 --> 00:08:42,719
明天晚上你在做什么？

127
00:08:42,720 --> 00:08:45,759
Going out with you by the sounds of it.

127
00:08:42,720 --> 00:08:45,759
听着它的声音和你一起出去。

128
00:08:45,760 --> 00:08:47,400
I could pick you up at seven?

128
00:08:45,760 --> 00:08:47,400
我可以七点来接你吗？

129
00:08:48,440 --> 00:08:49,840
I'd like that.

129
00:08:48,440 --> 00:08:49,840
我愿意。

130
00:08:56,560 --> 00:08:57,760
Thank you.

130
00:08:56,560 --> 00:08:57,760
谢谢你。

131
00:09:01,040 --> 00:09:02,279
What on earth?

131
00:09:01,040 --> 00:09:02,279
到底怎么回事？

132
00:09:02,280 --> 00:09:03,839
Tristan, just the man.

132
00:09:02,280 --> 00:09:03,839
特里斯坦，就是那个男人。

133
00:09:03,840 --> 00:09:05,439
Help me carry these out to the barn.

133
00:09:03,840 --> 00:09:05,439
帮我把这些带到谷仓。

134
00:09:05,440 --> 00:09:07,120
What's going on? You'll see.

134
00:09:05,440 --> 00:09:07,120
这是怎么回事？你会看到的。

135
00:09:11,160 --> 00:09:13,759
Now, one cannot be a great vet

135
00:09:11,160 --> 00:09:13,759
现在，一个人不可能成为一名出色的兽医

136
00:09:13,760 --> 00:09:17,399
until one has reared one's own animals.

136
00:09:13,760 --> 00:09:17,399
直到一个人饲养了自己的动物。

137
00:09:17,400 --> 00:09:20,039
Funny, never heard that one before.
Mm-hm.

137
00:09:17,400 --> 00:09:20,039
搞笑，以前没听过。
嗯嗯。

138
00:09:20,040 --> 00:09:21,839
So here you are, Tristan.

138
00:09:20,040 --> 00:09:21,839
所以你来了，特里斯坦。

139
00:09:21,840 --> 00:09:24,440
Meet your new brood.

139
00:09:21,840 --> 00:09:24,440
认识你的新成员。

140
00:09:28,480 --> 00:09:29,719
Wait, what?

140
00:09:28,480 --> 00:09:29,719
等等，什么？

141
00:09:29,720 --> 00:09:32,519
May I suggest you make a start
building a nest box for them?

141
00:09:29,720 --> 00:09:32,519
我可以建议你开始
为他们建造一个巢箱吗？

142
00:09:32,520 --> 00:09:35,680
A nest box? Nothing like
a fresh egg, warm from the nest.

142
00:09:32,520 --> 00:09:35,680
巢箱？没有什么像
新鲜的鸡蛋，从巢中温暖。

143
00:09:39,360 --> 00:09:42,200
Hang on, how come James never
had to rear his own animals?

143
00:09:39,360 --> 00:09:42,200
等等，为什么詹姆斯从来不需要
饲养自己的动物？

144
00:09:50,200 --> 00:09:51,960
This better not be a flock of sheep.

144
00:09:50,200 --> 00:09:51,960
这最好不是一群羊。

145
00:09:54,560 --> 00:09:56,999
Is Uncle Herriot here?

145
00:09:54,560 --> 00:09:56,999
赫里奥叔叔在吗？

146
00:09:57,000 --> 00:10:00,599
No, Uncle...
Mr Herriot is not here, I'm afraid.

146
00:09:57,000 --> 00:10:00,599
不，叔叔……
恐怕赫里奥先生不在。

147
00:10:00,600 --> 00:10:02,959
As I'm sure you're aware,
Mrs Pumphrey is attending

147
00:10:00,600 --> 00:10:02,959
我相信你知道，
Pumphrey 夫人正在参加

148
00:10:02,960 --> 00:10:05,559
the Test match in London and
I am under strict instruction

148
00:10:02,960 --> 00:10:05,559
伦敦的测试赛，
我受到严格的指导

149
00:10:05,560 --> 00:10:08,760
to deposit Tricki Woo into his
guardianship for the duration.

149
00:10:05,560 --> 00:10:08,760
在此期间将 Tricki Woo 存入他的
监护权。

150
00:10:10,600 --> 00:10:13,559
I'm sure Mr Farnon can
provide temporary guardianship

150
00:10:10,600 --> 00:10:13,559
我相信法农先生可以
提供临时监护权

151
00:10:13,560 --> 00:10:15,439
until Uncle Herriot returns.

151
00:10:13,560 --> 00:10:15,439
直到赫里奥叔叔回来。

152
00:10:15,440 --> 00:10:16,640
Most kind.

152
00:10:15,440 --> 00:10:16,640
最亲切。

153
00:10:34,040 --> 00:10:37,079
Now the evening sun sends
long shadows over the gasometers,

153
00:10:34,040 --> 00:10:37,079
现在傍晚的太阳
在煤气表上投下长长的阴影，

154
00:10:37,080 --> 00:10:39,839
Hutton has reached 150

154
00:10:37,080 --> 00:10:39,839
赫顿已达到 150

155
00:10:39,840 --> 00:10:43,440
and, with Leyland by his side,
looks like going on to 1,000.

155
00:10:39,840 --> 00:10:43,440
并且，有了 Leyland 在他身边，
看起来就像是 1,000。

156
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:49,079
Oh, thought you were Siegfried.

156
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:49,079
哦，还以为你是齐格弗里德。

157
00:10:49,080 --> 00:10:50,479
Since when do we have hens?

157
00:10:49,080 --> 00:10:50,479
我们什么时候有母鸡了？

158
00:10:50,480 --> 00:10:53,719
Since my big brother decided I need
to rear my own animals.

158
00:10:50,480 --> 00:10:53,719
由于我的大哥决定我需要
饲养自己的动物。

159
00:10:53,720 --> 00:10:55,639
What for? Exactly.

159
00:10:53,720 --> 00:10:55,639
做什么的？确切地。

160
00:10:55,640 --> 00:10:57,559
I thought now that
I'm a fully qualified vet

160
00:10:55,640 --> 00:10:57,559
我想现在
我是一个完全合格的兽医

161
00:10:57,560 --> 00:10:59,039
he'd finally stop hectoring me.

161
00:10:57,560 --> 00:10:59,039
他终于不再威胁我了。

162
00:10:59,040 --> 00:11:01,359
Perhaps he just
doesn't know how to yet.

162
00:10:59,040 --> 00:11:01,359
也许他只是
还不知道该怎么做。

163
00:11:01,360 --> 00:11:02,759
I don't know.

163
00:11:01,360 --> 00:11:02,759
我不知道。

164
00:11:02,760 --> 00:11:05,440
Doesn't seem to matter
what I do, it's never enough.

164
00:11:02,760 --> 00:11:05,440
我做什么似乎无关紧要，这永远不够。

165
00:11:06,760 --> 00:11:09,079
Then why don't you try
standing up to him?

165
00:11:06,760 --> 00:11:09,079
那你为什么不试着
站起来反对他呢？

166
00:11:09,080 --> 00:11:10,319
Worked for me.

166
00:11:09,080 --> 00:11:10,319
为我工作。

167
00:11:10,320 --> 00:11:11,919
You make it sound easy.

167
00:11:10,320 --> 00:11:11,919
你让这听起来很容易。

168
00:11:11,920 --> 00:11:13,559
Perhaps it is.

168
00:11:11,920 --> 00:11:13,559
也许是。

169
00:11:13,560 --> 00:11:15,040
Have you met my brother?

169
00:11:13,560 --> 00:11:15,040
你见过我哥吗？

170
00:11:17,160 --> 00:11:18,999
What is this supposed to be?

170
00:11:17,160 --> 00:11:18,999
这应该是什么？

171
00:11:19,000 --> 00:11:21,159
A nest box?

171
00:11:19,000 --> 00:11:21,159
巢箱？

172
00:11:21,160 --> 00:11:23,320
Give it here.

172
00:11:21,160 --> 00:11:23,320
给这里。

173
00:11:32,480 --> 00:11:34,679
How was your visit to the Dalbys?

173
00:11:32,480 --> 00:11:34,679
您对 Dalbys 的访问如何？

174
00:11:34,680 --> 00:11:36,199
It's not looking good.

174
00:11:34,680 --> 00:11:36,199
看起来不太好。

175
00:11:36,200 --> 00:11:37,400
Oh, dear.

175
00:11:36,200 --> 00:11:37,400
哦亲爱的。

176
00:11:41,440 --> 00:11:43,279
This is Maggie, by the way.

176
00:11:41,440 --> 00:11:43,279
顺便说一下，这是玛吉。

177
00:11:43,280 --> 00:11:44,959
Say hello, Maggie.

177
00:11:43,280 --> 00:11:44,959
打个招呼，玛吉。

178
00:11:44,960 --> 00:11:47,919
And, oh, look, this one here is Brenda.

178
00:11:44,960 --> 00:11:47,919
而且，哦，看，这里的这个是布伦达。

179
00:11:47,920 --> 00:11:51,079
Let me guess - they're all named
after your ex-girlfriends.

179
00:11:47,920 --> 00:11:51,079
让我猜猜——他们都是以
你前女友的名字命名的。

180
00:11:51,080 --> 00:11:52,919
No, not at all.

180
00:11:51,080 --> 00:11:52,919
一点都不。

181
00:11:52,920 --> 00:11:54,159
Here she is.

181
00:11:52,920 --> 00:11:54,159
她在这。

182
00:11:54,160 --> 00:11:57,239
This is Helen,
especially for you, James.

182
00:11:54,160 --> 00:11:57,239
这是海伦，
特别是对你来说，詹姆斯。

183
00:11:57,240 --> 00:12:00,040
Who knows? This one might
even let you take her out.

183
00:11:57,240 --> 00:12:00,040
谁知道？这个
甚至可以让你带她出去。

184
00:12:01,560 --> 00:12:03,519
I'll have you know that Helen and I

184
00:12:01,560 --> 00:12:03,519
我会让你知道海伦和我

185
00:12:03,520 --> 00:12:05,799
are going out on a date tomorrow night.

185
00:12:03,520 --> 00:12:05,799
明天晚上要出去约会。

186
00:12:05,800 --> 00:12:09,039
James!
That's fantastic... Sorry... news!

186
00:12:05,800 --> 00:12:09,039
詹姆士！
太棒了......对不起......消息！

187
00:12:09,040 --> 00:12:11,239
And where are you taking
the lovely Helen?

187
00:12:09,040 --> 00:12:11,239
你要把
可爱的海伦带到哪里去？

188
00:12:11,240 --> 00:12:12,919
Probably just the Drovers.

188
00:12:11,240 --> 00:12:12,919
可能只是 Drovers。

189
00:12:12,920 --> 00:12:14,199
The Drovers?

189
00:12:12,920 --> 00:12:14,199
德罗人？

190
00:12:14,200 --> 00:12:17,639
Look, tomorrow is your big chance
to finally impress Helen.

190
00:12:14,200 --> 00:12:17,639
听着，明天就是你
给海伦留下深刻印象的大好机会。

191
00:12:17,640 --> 00:12:19,839
You should take her to the Renniston.

191
00:12:17,640 --> 00:12:19,839
你应该带她去伦尼斯顿。

192
00:12:19,840 --> 00:12:22,239
Trust me, women like
to be wined and dined.

192
00:12:19,840 --> 00:12:22,239
相信我，女人喜欢
喝酒吃饭。

193
00:12:22,240 --> 00:12:23,440
Seems a bit grand.

193
00:12:22,240 --> 00:12:23,440
好像有点大。

194
00:12:23,441 --> 00:12:24,799
Can't you see it, Jim?

194
00:12:23,441 --> 00:12:24,799
你看不出来吗，吉姆？

195
00:12:24,800 --> 00:12:27,399
The music oozing out of
Benny Thornton's trombone

195
00:12:24,800 --> 00:12:27,399
从
本尼·桑顿的长号中渗出的音乐

196
00:12:27,400 --> 00:12:31,079
and you full of champagne,
and Helen leaning across the table,

196
00:12:27,400 --> 00:12:31,079
你喝着香槟，
海伦斜靠在桌子对面，

197
00:12:31,080 --> 00:12:33,639
the look of love in her eyes.

197
00:12:31,080 --> 00:12:33,639
她眼中的爱意。

198
00:12:33,640 --> 00:12:35,560
Oh, kiss me, Helen.

198
00:12:33,640 --> 00:12:35,560
哦，吻我，海伦。

199
00:12:37,440 --> 00:12:38,640
Oh, OK.

199
00:12:37,440 --> 00:12:38,640
哦好的。

200
00:12:40,120 --> 00:12:41,280
Maybe.

200
00:12:40,120 --> 00:12:41,280
也许。

201
00:12:41,280 --> 00:12:42,400
I mean, after Hugh,

201
00:12:41,280 --> 00:12:42,400
我的意思是，在休之后，

202
00:12:42,401 --> 00:12:45,480
she is probably more used
to the finer things in life.

202
00:12:42,401 --> 00:12:45,480
她可能更习惯于
生活中的美好事物。

203
00:12:59,280 --> 00:13:00,480
You still at it?

203
00:12:59,280 --> 00:13:00,480
你还在吗？

204
00:13:02,480 --> 00:13:04,199
Sorry.

204
00:13:02,480 --> 00:13:04,199
对不起。

205
00:13:04,200 --> 00:13:07,640
I'm still struggling to find
anything that might help Mrs Dalby.

205
00:13:04,200 --> 00:13:07,640
我仍在努力寻找
任何可能对达尔比夫人有帮助的东西。

206
00:13:09,040 --> 00:13:10,759
Don't worry.

206
00:13:09,040 --> 00:13:10,759
别担心。

207
00:13:10,760 --> 00:13:13,280
Here, I'll make a fresh pot.

207
00:13:10,760 --> 00:13:13,280
在这里，我会做一个新鲜的锅。

208
00:13:14,280 --> 00:13:16,599
Oh, Mrs Hall,
do you have a spare stamp?

208
00:13:14,280 --> 00:13:16,599
哦，霍尔太太，
你有备用邮票吗？

209
00:13:16,600 --> 00:13:18,639
Leave it here and I'll post it for you.

209
00:13:16,600 --> 00:13:18,639
把它留在这里，我会为你发布。

210
00:13:18,640 --> 00:13:19,840
Thank you.

210
00:13:18,640 --> 00:13:19,840
谢谢你。

211
00:13:21,200 --> 00:13:24,319
How is your mother?
Still struggling.

211
00:13:21,200 --> 00:13:24,319
你妈妈好吗？
还在挣扎。

212
00:13:24,320 --> 00:13:26,520
I'm just trying to help out
where I can but it's...

212
00:13:24,320 --> 00:13:26,520
我只是想尽
我所能提供帮助，但它...

213
00:13:27,760 --> 00:13:30,319
I'm sure she's grateful
for any help you can manage.

213
00:13:27,760 --> 00:13:30,319
我相信她会感激
你能提供的任何帮助。

214
00:13:30,320 --> 00:13:32,520
It still doesn't feel like it's enough.

214
00:13:30,320 --> 00:13:32,520
还是觉得不够。

215
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:35,839
To be honest, I just...

215
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:35,839
老实说，我只是...

216
00:13:35,840 --> 00:13:37,119
I still have no idea

216
00:13:35,840 --> 00:13:37,119
我还是不知道

217
00:13:37,120 --> 00:13:39,440
what I'm supposed to do
about the Glasgow job.

217
00:13:37,120 --> 00:13:39,440
我应该对
格拉斯哥的工作做些什么。

218
00:13:51,800 --> 00:13:54,239
Tricki's finally grown on you, then?

218
00:13:51,800 --> 00:13:54,239
特里奇终于对你长大了，然后？

219
00:13:54,240 --> 00:13:55,360
Like a fungus.

219
00:13:54,240 --> 00:13:55,360
像真菌一样。

220
00:13:55,361 --> 00:13:57,559
Well, he's definitely
taken a shine to you.

220
00:13:55,361 --> 00:13:57,559
嗯，他肯定
对你很有吸引力。

221
00:13:57,560 --> 00:14:00,079
I assure you I've given him
absolutely no reason to.

221
00:13:57,560 --> 00:14:00,079
我向你保证，我
绝对没有给他任何理由。

222
00:14:00,080 --> 00:14:02,239
Could say the same about Tristan.

222
00:14:00,080 --> 00:14:02,239
可以对特里斯坦说同样的话。

223
00:14:02,240 --> 00:14:04,439
He'd follow you
to the ends of the earth.

223
00:14:02,240 --> 00:14:04,439
他会跟着你
到天涯海角。

224
00:14:04,440 --> 00:14:05,640
Only to push me off.

224
00:14:04,440 --> 00:14:05,640
只是为了推开我。

225
00:14:09,480 --> 00:14:12,559
How are Phyllis's stirks
getting on? Not good.

225
00:14:09,480 --> 00:14:12,559
Phyllis 的情绪
如何发展？不好。

226
00:14:12,560 --> 00:14:14,959
It's the worst case of
husk I think I've seen.

226
00:14:12,560 --> 00:14:14,959
这是
我见过的最糟糕的外壳。

227
00:14:14,960 --> 00:14:16,080
Where are you up to?

227
00:14:14,960 --> 00:14:16,080
你到哪里去了？

228
00:14:16,081 --> 00:14:17,839
So we've taken the stirks off the field

228
00:14:16,081 --> 00:14:17,839
所以我们已经把马鞭从球场上拿走了

229
00:14:17,840 --> 00:14:20,599
and I've suggested
a diet of hay and cake. Mm-hm.

229
00:14:17,840 --> 00:14:20,599
我建议
吃干草和蛋糕。嗯嗯。

230
00:14:20,600 --> 00:14:22,799
But without an effective
treatment to speak of,

230
00:14:20,600 --> 00:14:22,799
但没有有效的
治疗可言，

231
00:14:22,800 --> 00:14:26,239
I'm a bit lost as to what else
I can do to try and save them.

231
00:14:22,800 --> 00:14:26,239
对于
我还能做些什么来尝试拯救它们，我有点迷茫。

232
00:14:26,240 --> 00:14:29,239
Perhaps you can't save them.

232
00:14:26,240 --> 00:14:29,239
也许你救不了他们。

233
00:14:29,240 --> 00:14:32,399
Every problem has a solution.
I just need to find it.

233
00:14:29,240 --> 00:14:32,399
每个问题都有解决方案。
我只需要找到它。

234
00:14:32,400 --> 00:14:35,159
I take it you've given them
the throat injection.

234
00:14:32,400 --> 00:14:35,159
我认为你已经给他们
注射了喉咙。

235
00:14:35,160 --> 00:14:37,319
That's just an old farmer's tale.

235
00:14:35,160 --> 00:14:37,319
这只是一个老农民的故事。

236
00:14:37,320 --> 00:14:38,999
Don't say that to their faces.

236
00:14:37,320 --> 00:14:38,999
不要当着他们的面说这些。

237
00:14:39,000 --> 00:14:42,279
I don't want to give her any more
false hope than I already have done.

237
00:14:39,000 --> 00:14:42,279
我不想给她
比我已经做的更多的虚假希望。

238
00:14:42,280 --> 00:14:45,239
And there's not much evidence
to suggest it actually helps.

238
00:14:42,280 --> 00:14:45,239
而且没有太多证据
表明它确实有帮助。

239
00:14:45,240 --> 00:14:47,679
There's not much evidence
that it doesn't help either.

239
00:14:45,240 --> 00:14:47,679
没有太多证据
表明它也没有帮助。

240
00:14:47,680 --> 00:14:50,759
So what have you got to lose?

240
00:14:47,680 --> 00:14:50,759
那你有什么损失？

241
00:14:50,760 --> 00:14:53,439
Morning, all.
Morning. Morning, Tristan.

241
00:14:50,760 --> 00:14:53,439
大家早。
早晨。早上好，特里斯坦。

242
00:14:53,440 --> 00:14:55,279
Fresh eggs coming right up.

242
00:14:53,440 --> 00:14:55,279
新鲜的鸡蛋马上上来了。

243
00:14:55,280 --> 00:14:56,920
We'll make a poulterer of you yet.

243
00:14:55,280 --> 00:14:56,920
我们会让你成为一个保镖。

244
00:15:10,840 --> 00:15:13,799
Good morning, ladies.

244
00:15:10,840 --> 00:15:13,799
早安女士们。

245
00:15:13,800 --> 00:15:16,120
What have you got
for me today, then, hey?

245
00:15:13,800 --> 00:15:16,120
那么，你
今天给我准备了什么，嘿？

246
00:15:25,120 --> 00:15:27,319
They're just getting used
to their new home.

246
00:15:25,120 --> 00:15:27,319
他们只是习惯
了他们的新家。

247
00:15:27,320 --> 00:15:28,440
Poppycock, they're chickens.

247
00:15:27,320 --> 00:15:28,440
罂粟花，它们是鸡。

248
00:15:28,441 --> 00:15:30,199
They don't know their beak
from their feet.

248
00:15:28,441 --> 00:15:30,199
他们
从脚上不知道自己的喙。

249
00:15:30,200 --> 00:15:33,239
It's your job to know what's
best for them. My job - exactly.

249
00:15:30,200 --> 00:15:33,239
知道什么
对他们最好是你的工作。我的工作 - 正是。

250
00:15:33,240 --> 00:15:35,479
And I say they just need a bit of
time and they'll figure it out

250
00:15:33,240 --> 00:15:35,479
我说他们只需要一点
时间 他们就会弄明白

251
00:15:35,480 --> 00:15:37,719
for themselves.
What they need is guidance.

251
00:15:35,480 --> 00:15:37,719
为他们自己。
他们需要的是指导。

252
00:15:37,720 --> 00:15:40,479
Find yourself something resembling
an egg then put it in the nest...

252
00:15:37,720 --> 00:15:40,479
给自己找一个类似
鸡蛋的东西，然后把它放进窝里……

253
00:15:40,480 --> 00:15:42,119
No.

253
00:15:40,480 --> 00:15:42,119
不。

254
00:15:42,120 --> 00:15:45,399
No, what? No, I'm not
listening to you any more.

254
00:15:42,120 --> 00:15:45,399
不，什么？不，我不再
听你的了。

255
00:15:45,400 --> 00:15:48,119
You put me in charge of these hens
so I'm going to do it my way.

255
00:15:45,400 --> 00:15:48,119
你让我负责这些母鸡，
所以我会按照我的方式去做。

256
00:15:48,120 --> 00:15:49,559
You're being ridiculous.

256
00:15:48,120 --> 00:15:49,559
你太可笑了。

257
00:15:49,560 --> 00:15:51,799
And I can guarantee that
by tomorrow morning,

257
00:15:49,560 --> 00:15:51,799
我可以保证到
明天早上，

258
00:15:51,800 --> 00:15:54,079
these hens will have eggs
coming out of their...

258
00:15:51,800 --> 00:15:54,079
这些母鸡会
从它们的...

259
00:15:55,400 --> 00:15:56,799
..ears.

259
00:15:55,400 --> 00:15:56,799
..耳朵。

260
00:15:56,800 --> 00:15:58,039
Wh...

260
00:15:56,800 --> 00:15:58,039
什...

261
00:16:01,760 --> 00:16:06,159
Oh, God damn it,
you stupid bloody animal.

261
00:16:01,760 --> 00:16:06,159
哦，该死的，
你这个愚蠢的血腥动物。

262
00:16:06,160 --> 00:16:07,400
God!

262
00:16:06,160 --> 00:16:07,400
上帝！

263
00:16:38,120 --> 00:16:41,039
Morning, Mrs Dalby.
Hello. How are they today?

263
00:16:38,120 --> 00:16:41,039
早上好，达尔比夫人。
你好。他们今天怎么样？

264
00:16:41,040 --> 00:16:44,880
Still fighting. I've been giving
them the cake and hay like you said.

264
00:16:41,040 --> 00:16:44,880
还在战斗。
就像你说的，我一直在给他们蛋糕和干草。

265
00:16:45,880 --> 00:16:48,159
I emptied my penny jar to pay for cake.

265
00:16:45,880 --> 00:16:48,159
我清空了我的便士罐来买蛋糕。

266
00:16:48,160 --> 00:16:50,879
You're a good lad, Billy.
Your dad would be proud.

266
00:16:48,160 --> 00:16:50,879
你是个好孩子，比利。
你爸爸会很自豪的。

267
00:16:50,880 --> 00:16:53,240
Hey, Billy, give us a hand with this.

267
00:16:50,880 --> 00:16:53,240
嘿，比利，帮我们解决这个问题。

268
00:16:54,600 --> 00:16:58,919
I actually dipped into the family
savings to pay for the cake.

268
00:16:54,600 --> 00:16:58,919
我实际上动用了家庭
储蓄来支付蛋糕。

269
00:16:58,920 --> 00:17:00,799
But Billy was so desperate to help

269
00:16:58,920 --> 00:17:00,799
但是比利非常想帮忙

270
00:17:00,800 --> 00:17:03,039
that I let him think
we used his pennies.

270
00:17:00,800 --> 00:17:03,039
我让他认为
我们用了他的便士。

271
00:17:03,040 --> 00:17:05,439
Probably scatter them on the farm
when he's not looking,

271
00:17:03,040 --> 00:17:05,439
可能
在他不注意的时候把它们撒在农场上，

272
00:17:05,440 --> 00:17:06,999
let him think he's found more.

272
00:17:05,440 --> 00:17:06,999
让他觉得他找到了更多。

273
00:17:07,000 --> 00:17:10,119
What about a throat injection?
Farmers round here swear by it.

273
00:17:07,000 --> 00:17:10,119
喉咙注射怎么办？
这里的农民发誓。

274
00:17:10,120 --> 00:17:11,719
We could try.

274
00:17:10,120 --> 00:17:11,719
我们可以试试。

275
00:17:11,720 --> 00:17:14,679
It's a mix of chloroform,
turpentine and creosote.

275
00:17:11,720 --> 00:17:14,679
它是氯仿、
松节油和杂酚油的混合物。

276
00:17:14,680 --> 00:17:18,999
There's no guarantee that it will
help but... We can always hope.

276
00:17:14,680 --> 00:17:18,999
不能保证它会
有所帮助，但是......我们总是可以希望。

277
00:17:19,000 --> 00:17:21,960
Right, Mr Herriot? Right, aye.

277
00:17:19,000 --> 00:17:21,960
对吧，赫里奥特先生？对，对。

278
00:17:26,440 --> 00:17:28,599
It's nothing serious.

278
00:17:26,440 --> 00:17:28,599
没什么大不了的。

279
00:17:28,600 --> 00:17:30,439
Just a small cut, by the looks of it.

279
00:17:28,600 --> 00:17:30,439
看起来只是一个小切口。

280
00:17:30,440 --> 00:17:32,479
Well, thank God for that.

280
00:17:30,440 --> 00:17:32,479
嗯，为此感谢上帝。

281
00:17:32,480 --> 00:17:34,719
Mrs Pumphrey would
have our guts for garters.

281
00:17:32,480 --> 00:17:34,719
Pumphrey 夫人
对吊袜带有我们的胆量。

282
00:17:34,720 --> 00:17:36,959
That'll teach him to get
involved with the chickens.

282
00:17:34,720 --> 00:17:36,959
那会教他如何
与鸡打交道。

283
00:17:36,960 --> 00:17:38,879
Will it? What?

283
00:17:36,960 --> 00:17:38,879
会吗？什么？

284
00:17:38,880 --> 00:17:40,599
You know very well, what.

284
00:17:38,880 --> 00:17:40,599
你很清楚，什么。

285
00:17:40,600 --> 00:17:42,919
If you'd left well alone,
none of this would have happened.

285
00:17:40,600 --> 00:17:42,919
如果你一个人呆着，
这一切都不会发生。

286
00:17:42,920 --> 00:17:46,039
How is it my fault that he...?
All he wants to do is make you proud

286
00:17:42,920 --> 00:17:46,039
他……怎么是我的错？
他只想让你骄傲

287
00:17:46,040 --> 00:17:50,279
but you set these standards for him
that are impossible to meet.

287
00:17:46,040 --> 00:17:50,279
但是你为他设定了这些
不可能达到的标准。

288
00:17:50,280 --> 00:17:55,079
If you just left him to it once
in a while, maybe he'd surprise you.

288
00:17:50,280 --> 00:17:55,079
如果你只是
偶尔放过他，也许他会让你大吃一惊。

289
00:17:55,080 --> 00:17:59,159
We're not talking about Tricki Woo
any more, are we?

289
00:17:55,080 --> 00:17:59,159
我们不再谈论崔奇雨
了，是吗？

290
00:17:59,160 --> 00:18:02,119
We're simple folk, really, Mr Farnon.

290
00:17:59,160 --> 00:18:02,119
我们是普通人，真的，法农先生。

291
00:18:02,120 --> 00:18:04,959
We all just want the occasional
pat on the head.

291
00:18:02,120 --> 00:18:04,959
我们都只想偶尔
拍拍头。

292
00:18:04,960 --> 00:18:07,159
Isn't that right, Tricki?

292
00:18:04,960 --> 00:18:07,159
不是吗，崔基？

293
00:18:07,160 --> 00:18:08,919
Hm?

293
00:18:07,160 --> 00:18:08,919
嗯？

294
00:18:08,920 --> 00:18:10,120
Mm?

294
00:18:08,920 --> 00:18:10,120
毫米？

295
00:18:12,680 --> 00:18:14,879
Thanks for helping us
with all of this, Mr Herriot.

295
00:18:12,680 --> 00:18:14,879
感谢您帮助我们
解决所有这些问题，Herriot 先生。

296
00:18:14,880 --> 00:18:16,639
Yeah, thank you, Mr Herriot.

296
00:18:14,880 --> 00:18:16,639
好的，谢谢你，赫里奥特先生。

297
00:18:16,640 --> 00:18:18,959
Not at all.
You did all the hard work.

297
00:18:16,640 --> 00:18:18,959
一点也不。
你做了所有的努力。

298
00:18:18,960 --> 00:18:20,719
I had the easy job.

298
00:18:18,960 --> 00:18:20,719
我有一份轻松的工作。

299
00:18:20,720 --> 00:18:22,440
Mr Herriot! Mrs Dalby!

299
00:18:20,720 --> 00:18:22,440
赫里奥特先生！达尔比夫人！

300
00:18:33,400 --> 00:18:37,680
Hey, Billy, why don't you give me
a hand to fetch them some more hay?

300
00:18:33,400 --> 00:18:37,680
嘿，比利，你为什么不帮我
拿些干草给他们呢？

301
00:18:44,000 --> 00:18:45,200
I'm so sorry.

301
00:18:44,000 --> 00:18:45,200
我很抱歉。

302
00:18:48,720 --> 00:18:50,159
I'm not a farmer.

302
00:18:48,720 --> 00:18:50,159
我不是农民。

303
00:18:50,160 --> 00:18:51,799
Billy was the farmer.

303
00:18:50,160 --> 00:18:51,799
比利是农民。

304
00:18:51,800 --> 00:18:53,519
He knew everything there was to know

304
00:18:51,800 --> 00:18:53,519
他知道所有需要知道的

305
00:18:53,520 --> 00:18:57,039
and he was so proud the life we'd
built here and I'm letting him down.

305
00:18:53,520 --> 00:18:57,039
他为我们在
这里建立的生活感到非常自豪，我让他失望了。

306
00:18:57,040 --> 00:18:59,639
Phyllis, you're not
letting anyone down.

306
00:18:57,040 --> 00:18:59,639
菲利斯，你不会
让任何人失望的。

307
00:18:59,640 --> 00:19:01,279
I know it can feel like that sometimes

307
00:18:59,640 --> 00:19:01,279
我知道有时会有这种感觉

308
00:19:01,280 --> 00:19:03,439
but you're doing the best you can.

308
00:19:01,280 --> 00:19:03,439
但你正在尽你所能。

309
00:19:03,440 --> 00:19:05,680
But what if my best isn't good enough?

309
00:19:03,440 --> 00:19:05,680
但是如果我的最好的还不够好怎么办？

310
00:19:07,080 --> 00:19:09,800
What you're trying to do here is hard.

310
00:19:07,080 --> 00:19:09,800
你在这里尝试做的事情很难。

311
00:19:11,200 --> 00:19:13,080
Anyone would doubt themselves.

311
00:19:11,200 --> 00:19:13,080
任何人都会怀疑自己。

312
00:19:14,280 --> 00:19:15,920
Mum, are we going to be all right?

312
00:19:14,280 --> 00:19:15,920
妈妈，我们会没事吗？

313
00:19:18,400 --> 00:19:19,600
Come here, love.

313
00:19:18,400 --> 00:19:19,600
来这里，爱。

314
00:19:24,640 --> 00:19:25,840
Of course we are.

314
00:19:24,640 --> 00:19:25,840
我们当然是。

315
00:19:33,040 --> 00:19:34,839
Here we go, James.

315
00:19:33,040 --> 00:19:34,839
我们走了，詹姆斯。

316
00:19:34,840 --> 00:19:37,039
All fresh and aired.

316
00:19:34,840 --> 00:19:37,039
所有新鲜空气。

317
00:19:37,040 --> 00:19:38,440
Thanks, Mrs H.

317
00:19:37,040 --> 00:19:38,440
谢谢，H太太。

318
00:19:41,520 --> 00:19:43,839
Oh, very handsome.

318
00:19:41,520 --> 00:19:43,839
好帅哦

319
00:19:43,840 --> 00:19:46,319
It'll be a miracle if they
make it through the night.

319
00:19:43,840 --> 00:19:46,319
如果他们
能熬过一夜，那将是一个奇迹。

320
00:19:46,320 --> 00:19:48,519
Having been proved wrong
more than once,

320
00:19:46,320 --> 00:19:48,519
不止一次被证明是错误的
，

321
00:19:48,520 --> 00:19:52,080
I've learned never to underestimate
the resilience of nature.

321
00:19:48,520 --> 00:19:52,080
我学会了永远不要低估
大自然的弹性。

322
00:19:54,400 --> 00:19:55,919
Right, well, I best be off.

322
00:19:54,400 --> 00:19:55,919
好吧，我最好离开。

323
00:19:55,920 --> 00:19:57,759
Cheerio. Good luck.

323
00:19:55,920 --> 00:19:57,759
啦啦队。祝你好运。

324
00:19:57,760 --> 00:19:59,319
Oh...

324
00:19:57,760 --> 00:19:59,319
哦...

325
00:19:59,320 --> 00:20:00,640
Wait a sec.

325
00:19:59,320 --> 00:20:00,640
等一下。

326
00:20:02,440 --> 00:20:05,079
I've posted your letter for you.
Thanks.

326
00:20:02,440 --> 00:20:05,079
我已经把你的信寄给你了。
谢谢。

327
00:20:05,080 --> 00:20:07,399
I know it's hard but you've done
what you can today

327
00:20:05,080 --> 00:20:07,399
我知道这很难，但你
今天已经做了你能做的

328
00:20:07,400 --> 00:20:09,879
for Phyllis and your mother.

328
00:20:07,400 --> 00:20:09,879
为了菲利斯和你妈妈。

329
00:20:09,880 --> 00:20:13,680
Now go have a wonderful time
with Helen. It's important.

329
00:20:09,880 --> 00:20:13,680
现在去
和海伦一起度过美好的时光吧。这一点很重要。

330
00:20:24,040 --> 00:20:26,679
Mr Ingledew. Good evening.

330
00:20:24,040 --> 00:20:26,679
英格杜先生。晚上好。

331
00:20:26,680 --> 00:20:27,919
I presume this is yours.

331
00:20:26,680 --> 00:20:27,919
我想这是你的。

332
00:20:27,920 --> 00:20:30,359
I saw them arrive yesterday.

332
00:20:27,920 --> 00:20:30,359
我昨天看到他们到了。

333
00:20:30,360 --> 00:20:31,560
Tristan?

333
00:20:30,360 --> 00:20:31,560
特里斯坦？

334
00:20:32,760 --> 00:20:33,960
Tristan!

334
00:20:32,760 --> 00:20:33,960
特里斯坦！

335
00:20:40,040 --> 00:20:41,320
Thanks, James.

335
00:20:40,040 --> 00:20:41,320
谢谢，詹姆斯。

336
00:20:53,160 --> 00:20:55,120
Come on, Annabel, let's get you home.

336
00:20:53,160 --> 00:20:55,120
来吧，安娜贝尔，让我们送你回家。

337
00:20:58,600 --> 00:21:00,039
God!

337
00:20:58,600 --> 00:21:00,039
上帝！

338
00:21:00,040 --> 00:21:01,240
That was close.

338
00:21:00,040 --> 00:21:01,240
那很接近了。

339
00:21:08,120 --> 00:21:09,400
Damn it.

339
00:21:08,120 --> 00:21:09,400
该死的。

340
00:21:14,240 --> 00:21:15,480
Oh, no!

340
00:21:14,240 --> 00:21:15,480
不好了！

341
00:21:33,640 --> 00:21:34,880
Damn it.

341
00:21:33,640 --> 00:21:34,880
该死的。

342
00:21:48,040 --> 00:21:49,599
Oh, dear.

342
00:21:48,040 --> 00:21:49,599
哦亲爱的。

343
00:21:49,600 --> 00:21:51,080
You'd better come in, James.

343
00:21:49,600 --> 00:21:51,080
你最好进来，詹姆斯。

344
00:22:00,440 --> 00:22:01,919
Oh, dear, indeed.

344
00:22:00,440 --> 00:22:01,919
哦，亲爱的，确实如此。

345
00:22:01,920 --> 00:22:04,119
The car ran into a bit of
a ditch on the way over.

345
00:22:01,920 --> 00:22:04,119
车子
在路上撞到了一条沟。

346
00:22:04,120 --> 00:22:05,839
Perhaps you can borrow
a pair of my dad's shoes.

346
00:22:04,120 --> 00:22:05,839
也许你可以借
一双我爸爸的鞋子。

347
00:22:05,840 --> 00:22:08,399
Oh, no, that's quite all right.
You can't go out like that.

347
00:22:05,840 --> 00:22:08,399
哦，不，没关系。
你不能就那样出去。

348
00:22:08,400 --> 00:22:10,759
Dad, lend James some shoes
and socks, will you?

348
00:22:08,400 --> 00:22:10,759
爸爸，借给詹姆斯一些鞋子
和袜子，好吗？

349
00:22:10,760 --> 00:22:13,840
There's really no need...
Nonsense. Dad don't mind.

349
00:22:10,760 --> 00:22:13,840
真的没必要……
废话。爸爸不介意。

350
00:22:19,600 --> 00:22:23,000
Here. You can wipe your trousers
down with this. Thanks.

350
00:22:19,600 --> 00:22:23,000
这里。你可以
用这个擦你的裤子。谢谢。

351
00:22:27,800 --> 00:22:29,279
There you go.

351
00:22:27,800 --> 00:22:29,279
你去吧。

352
00:22:29,280 --> 00:22:31,440
My old dancing shoes.

352
00:22:29,280 --> 00:22:31,440
我的旧舞鞋。

353
00:22:32,400 --> 00:22:35,439
Been a while since
they've had an outing.

353
00:22:32,400 --> 00:22:35,439
已经有一段时间，因为
他们已经去春游。

354
00:22:35,440 --> 00:22:38,199
Oh... Honestly, I'll be fine.

354
00:22:35,440 --> 00:22:38,199
哦...老实说，我会没事的。

355
00:22:38,200 --> 00:22:39,960
Are they not to your liking, James?

355
00:22:38,200 --> 00:22:39,960
他们不是你喜欢的吗，詹姆斯？

356
00:22:41,200 --> 00:22:44,359
No, no, these are...

356
00:22:41,200 --> 00:22:44,359
不不不，这些是……

357
00:22:44,360 --> 00:22:45,560
They're perfect.

357
00:22:44,360 --> 00:22:45,560
他们是完美的。

358
00:22:47,280 --> 00:22:48,639
Thank you, Mr Alderson.

358
00:22:47,280 --> 00:22:48,639
谢谢你，奥尔德森先生。

359
00:22:48,640 --> 00:22:50,599
Aye.

359
00:22:48,640 --> 00:22:50,599
是的。

360
00:22:50,600 --> 00:22:52,120
I'll go see what Helen's up to.

360
00:22:50,600 --> 00:22:52,120
我去看看海伦在做什么。

361
00:22:56,920 --> 00:22:58,120
James is here.

361
00:22:56,920 --> 00:22:58,120
詹姆斯来了。

362
00:22:58,121 --> 00:23:00,479
Can you make sure dad checks
the tarpaulin on the barn roof

362
00:22:58,121 --> 00:23:00,479
你能确保爸爸检查
谷仓屋顶的防水油布吗

363
00:23:00,480 --> 00:23:03,919
and make sure...?
Stop worrying. Go enjoy yourself.

363
00:23:00,480 --> 00:23:03,919
并确保...？
别担心了。去享受吧。

364
00:23:03,920 --> 00:23:05,920
Me and Dad will be
just fine without you.

364
00:23:03,920 --> 00:23:05,920
没有你，我和爸爸会过得很好。

365
00:23:14,600 --> 00:23:15,800
Sorry, James.

365
00:23:14,600 --> 00:23:15,800
对不起，詹姆斯。

366
00:23:19,720 --> 00:23:22,639
I thought we could go to the
Renniston for dinner.

366
00:23:19,720 --> 00:23:22,639
我想我们可以去
伦尼斯顿吃晚饭。

367
00:23:22,640 --> 00:23:25,120
I should go and get changed, then.
No, you look...

367
00:23:22,640 --> 00:23:25,120
那我该去换衣服了。
不，你看起来...

368
00:23:27,400 --> 00:23:28,600
..perfect.

368
00:23:27,400 --> 00:23:28,600
..完美的。

369
00:23:31,920 --> 00:23:34,480
Go on, then. Don't want to
be late for the Renniston.

369
00:23:31,920 --> 00:23:34,480
那么继续吧。不想
迟到伦尼斯顿。

370
00:23:36,320 --> 00:23:38,479
I won't be late.

370
00:23:36,320 --> 00:23:38,479
我不会迟到的。

371
00:23:38,480 --> 00:23:39,680
Enjoy yourself, love.

371
00:23:38,480 --> 00:23:39,680
享受自己，爱。

372
00:23:58,160 --> 00:23:59,360
Goodbye.

372
00:23:58,160 --> 00:23:59,360
再见。

373
00:24:04,281 --> 00:24:05,960
I'll get it!

373
00:24:04,281 --> 00:24:05,960
我会得到它的！

374
00:24:13,800 --> 00:24:15,000
Tristan!

374
00:24:13,800 --> 00:24:15,000
特里斯坦！

375
00:24:15,960 --> 00:24:19,359
I give you this simple, little job
one would have thought even you

375
00:24:15,960 --> 00:24:19,359
我给了你一份简单的小工作，
即使是你也会想到

376
00:24:19,360 --> 00:24:22,599
would be hard put to make a mess
of it and look at the situation.

376
00:24:19,360 --> 00:24:22,599
很难把
它弄得一团糟，看看情况。

377
00:24:22,600 --> 00:24:25,399
Not one solitary egg have we seen,

377
00:24:22,600 --> 00:24:25,399
我们没有见过一个单独的鸡蛋，

378
00:24:25,400 --> 00:24:28,119
the bloody hens are flying
about the place like pigeons

378
00:24:25,400 --> 00:24:28,119
血腥的母鸡
像鸽子一样在这个地方飞来飞去

379
00:24:28,120 --> 00:24:30,559
and we are now permanently
estranged from our neighbours.

379
00:24:28,120 --> 00:24:30,559
我们现在
与我们的邻居永久疏远了。

380
00:24:30,560 --> 00:24:33,879
I'm sorry, Siegfried.
I'm sure I put the latch down.

380
00:24:30,560 --> 00:24:33,879
对不起，齐格弗里德。
我确定我把门闩放下了。

381
00:24:33,880 --> 00:24:36,120
I always double-check.
I don't...

381
00:24:33,880 --> 00:24:36,120
我总是仔细检查。
我不...

382
00:24:38,600 --> 00:24:43,279
..want to hear it. Just... try not to
burn the house down while I'm out.

382
00:24:38,600 --> 00:24:43,279
..想听。只是……
我不在的时候尽量不要把房子烧毁。

383
00:24:43,280 --> 00:24:44,799
Who's up for games night?

383
00:24:43,280 --> 00:24:44,799
谁在玩游戏之夜？

384
00:24:44,800 --> 00:24:46,999
Sorry, Mrs Hall, I'm out
with Diana tonight.

384
00:24:44,800 --> 00:24:46,999
抱歉，霍尔夫人，我
今晚要和戴安娜出去。

385
00:24:47,000 --> 00:24:48,719
In fact...

385
00:24:47,000 --> 00:24:48,719
实际上...

386
00:24:48,720 --> 00:24:50,000
..I'm running late as it is.

386
00:24:48,720 --> 00:24:50,000
..我迟到了。

387
00:24:52,400 --> 00:24:54,279
I've got to see a man...

387
00:24:52,400 --> 00:24:54,279
我要见一个人...

388
00:24:54,280 --> 00:24:56,319
..about a chicken.

388
00:24:54,280 --> 00:24:56,319
..关于一只鸡。

389
00:24:56,320 --> 00:24:57,800
Sorry, Mrs H.

389
00:24:56,320 --> 00:24:57,800
对不起，H女士。

390
00:25:06,360 --> 00:25:07,760
Right...

390
00:25:06,360 --> 00:25:07,760
对...

391
00:25:09,880 --> 00:25:11,520
Just me then, is it?

391
00:25:09,880 --> 00:25:11,520
那么只有我，是吗？

392
00:25:33,280 --> 00:25:34,480
Thank you.

392
00:25:33,280 --> 00:25:34,480
谢谢你。

393
00:25:52,320 --> 00:25:55,480
Miss Alderson, how lovely
to see you again. Hello.

393
00:25:52,320 --> 00:25:55,480
奥尔德森小姐，
再次见到你真是太好了。你好。

394
00:25:57,280 --> 00:25:59,439
Would you care for a table, sir?

394
00:25:57,280 --> 00:25:59,439
先生，您需要一张桌子吗？

395
00:25:59,440 --> 00:26:01,439
Yes, please.

395
00:25:59,440 --> 00:26:01,439
是的，请。

396
00:26:01,440 --> 00:26:02,640
Table for two.

396
00:26:01,440 --> 00:26:02,640
两人桌。

397
00:26:03,720 --> 00:26:04,920
This way, please.

397
00:26:03,720 --> 00:26:04,920
这边请。

398
00:26:12,200 --> 00:26:13,400
Excuse me?

398
00:26:12,200 --> 00:26:13,400
打扰一下？

399
00:26:22,280 --> 00:26:23,640
How's Phyllis getting on?

399
00:26:22,280 --> 00:26:23,640
菲利斯最近怎么样？

400
00:26:24,800 --> 00:26:27,319
She lost one of her stirks
when I was there today.

400
00:26:24,800 --> 00:26:27,319
当我今天在那里时，她失去了一根马鞭。

401
00:26:27,320 --> 00:26:30,919
Oh, James, I'm so sorry. That must
have been difficult for you both.

401
00:26:27,320 --> 00:26:30,919
哦，詹姆斯，我很抱歉。这
对你们俩来说一定很困难。

402
00:26:30,920 --> 00:26:32,919
I just wish I'd seen them sooner.

402
00:26:30,920 --> 00:26:32,919
我只是希望我早点见到他们。

403
00:26:32,920 --> 00:26:35,479
She might have had
a fighting chance a week ago.

403
00:26:32,920 --> 00:26:35,479
她可能
在一周前就有了战斗的机会。

404
00:26:35,480 --> 00:26:36,959
Well, you're there now,

404
00:26:35,480 --> 00:26:36,959
嗯，你现在在那里，

405
00:26:36,960 --> 00:26:39,679
and if anyone can pull it off,
it's Phyllis.

405
00:26:36,960 --> 00:26:39,679
如果有人能把它拉下来，
那就是菲利斯。

406
00:26:39,680 --> 00:26:41,919
I just worry it's too little, too late.

406
00:26:39,680 --> 00:26:41,919
我只是担心它太少，太晚了。

407
00:26:41,920 --> 00:26:44,119
It's not like you to give up so easily.

407
00:26:41,920 --> 00:26:44,119
不像你那样轻易放弃。

408
00:26:44,120 --> 00:26:45,479
You didn't see her today.

408
00:26:44,120 --> 00:26:45,479
你今天没看到她。

409
00:26:45,480 --> 00:26:47,679
She's already having to use
her winter supply of hay

409
00:26:45,480 --> 00:26:47,679
她已经不得不
用完冬天的干草了

410
00:26:47,680 --> 00:26:51,599
and spending money that she
doesn't have on expensive cake.

410
00:26:47,680 --> 00:26:51,599
把她
没有的钱花在昂贵的蛋糕上。

411
00:26:51,600 --> 00:26:54,559
I just want to give her
any more false hope.

411
00:26:51,600 --> 00:26:54,559
我只是想给她
更多虚假的希望。

412
00:26:54,560 --> 00:26:57,679
I'm sorry. I shouldn't be
burdening you with all of this.

412
00:26:54,560 --> 00:26:57,679
抱歉。我不应该
让你承受这一切。

413
00:26:57,680 --> 00:26:59,159
You're not burdening me.

413
00:26:57,680 --> 00:26:59,159
你没有给我增加负担。

414
00:26:59,160 --> 00:27:00,400
It's nice that you care.

414
00:26:59,160 --> 00:27:00,400
很高兴你在乎。

415
00:27:02,560 --> 00:27:04,719
Farming's a tough life.

415
00:27:02,560 --> 00:27:04,719
务农生活艰苦。

416
00:27:04,720 --> 00:27:06,919
So much loss and hardship.

416
00:27:04,720 --> 00:27:06,919
这么多的损失和艰辛。

417
00:27:06,920 --> 00:27:08,200
It's bloody hard work.

417
00:27:06,920 --> 00:27:08,200
这是血腥的艰苦工作。

418
00:27:09,640 --> 00:27:11,639
Do you ever think you could leave?

418
00:27:09,640 --> 00:27:11,639
你有没有想过你可以离开？

419
00:27:11,640 --> 00:27:13,799
Do something different? Me?

419
00:27:11,640 --> 00:27:13,799
做点不一样的事？我？

420
00:27:13,800 --> 00:27:16,039
I think about it all the time.

420
00:27:13,800 --> 00:27:16,039
我一直在想它。

421
00:27:16,040 --> 00:27:18,799
I think what it might be like to
not have dirt under my fingernails

421
00:27:16,040 --> 00:27:18,799
我想
我的指甲下没有污垢会是什么感觉

422
00:27:18,800 --> 00:27:23,040
every day, not have to worry
about money, or shovel muck.

422
00:27:18,800 --> 00:27:23,040
每天都不必为
钱发愁，也不必为铲粪发愁。

423
00:27:25,200 --> 00:27:26,560
Thank you.

423
00:27:25,200 --> 00:27:26,560
谢谢你。

424
00:27:30,720 --> 00:27:31,920
Thank you.

424
00:27:30,720 --> 00:27:31,920
谢谢你。

425
00:27:35,600 --> 00:27:40,199
I've been thinking
about Phyllis and farming

425
00:27:35,600 --> 00:27:40,199
我一直在考虑
菲利斯和农业

426
00:27:40,200 --> 00:27:43,679
and what you were saying
just now and... and...

426
00:27:40,200 --> 00:27:43,679
还有你
刚才说的……还有……

427
00:27:43,680 --> 00:27:45,599
And what, James?

427
00:27:43,680 --> 00:27:45,599
还有什么，詹姆斯？

428
00:27:45,600 --> 00:27:48,519
Well, perhaps it doesn't
have to be a struggle...

428
00:27:45,600 --> 00:27:48,519
好吧，也许它不必
是一场斗争......

429
00:27:48,520 --> 00:27:50,239
..for Phyllis.

429
00:27:48,520 --> 00:27:50,239
..为了菲利斯。

430
00:27:50,240 --> 00:27:52,999
All the other farmers think
she should sell the farm

430
00:27:50,240 --> 00:27:52,999
所有其他农民都认为
她应该卖掉农场

431
00:27:53,000 --> 00:27:56,239
and maybe they're right.
Maybe it's not too late.

431
00:27:53,000 --> 00:27:56,239
也许他们是对的。
也许现在还不算太晚。

432
00:27:56,240 --> 00:27:59,879
She could sell up, move away,
make a fresh start somewhere new.

432
00:27:56,240 --> 00:27:59,879
她可以卖掉，搬走，
在新的地方重新开始。

433
00:27:59,880 --> 00:28:03,039
All the memories of Billy
are tied up in that farm.

433
00:27:59,880 --> 00:28:03,039
比利的所有记忆
都被绑在那个农场里。

434
00:28:03,040 --> 00:28:04,639
All the boy's memories.

434
00:28:03,040 --> 00:28:04,639
所有男孩的记忆。

435
00:28:04,640 --> 00:28:07,439
That would mean her leaving behind
everything she's ever known.

435
00:28:04,640 --> 00:28:07,439
那将意味着她抛弃了
她所知道的一切。

436
00:28:07,440 --> 00:28:09,079
It's what I had to do.

436
00:28:07,440 --> 00:28:09,079
这是我必须做的。

437
00:28:09,080 --> 00:28:11,640
That's different.
You made a choice to come here.

437
00:28:09,080 --> 00:28:11,640
那不一样。
你做出了来这里的选择。

438
00:28:12,680 --> 00:28:14,479
It doesn't mean it was easy.

438
00:28:12,680 --> 00:28:14,479
这并不意味着这很容易。

439
00:28:14,480 --> 00:28:18,320
My life was in Glasgow,
my friends, my family.

439
00:28:14,480 --> 00:28:18,320
我的生活在格拉斯哥，
我的朋友，我的家人。

440
00:28:19,760 --> 00:28:21,240
It's not the same.

440
00:28:19,760 --> 00:28:21,240
这是不一样的。

441
00:28:22,600 --> 00:28:23,800
Why not?

441
00:28:22,600 --> 00:28:23,800
为什么不？

442
00:28:24,800 --> 00:28:26,080
Because I'm not a farmer?

442
00:28:24,800 --> 00:28:26,080
因为我不是农民？

443
00:28:28,400 --> 00:28:30,999
Because your life isn't
the ground under your feet.

443
00:28:28,400 --> 00:28:30,999
因为你的生活不是
你脚下的土地。

444
00:28:31,000 --> 00:28:34,799
You haven't poured blood, sweat and
tears into the soil you plough.

444
00:28:31,000 --> 00:28:34,799
你还没有把鲜血、汗水和
眼泪倒进你犁过的土壤里。

445
00:28:34,800 --> 00:28:37,639
You haven't raised animals from
birth knowing they could be

445
00:28:34,800 --> 00:28:37,639
你从一
出生就没有养过动物，知道它们可以

446
00:28:37,640 --> 00:28:41,279
taken from your any moment
and, with them, your livelihood.

446
00:28:37,640 --> 00:28:41,279
从您的任何时刻
以及与他们一起夺走您的生计。

447
00:28:41,280 --> 00:28:44,159
I feel like you're making
my argument for me.

447
00:28:41,280 --> 00:28:44,159
我觉得你在为
我辩解。

448
00:28:44,160 --> 00:28:46,919
Billy Dalby took on
that farm from his father,

448
00:28:44,160 --> 00:28:46,919
比利·达尔比
从他父亲那里接手了那个农场，

449
00:28:46,920 --> 00:28:50,239
and his father before him.
It's young Billy's birthright.

449
00:28:46,920 --> 00:28:50,239
和他的父亲在他面前。
这是年轻的比利与生俱来的权利。

450
00:28:50,240 --> 00:28:52,600
So long as there's
something left to inherit.

450
00:28:50,240 --> 00:28:52,600
只要有
东西可以继承。

451
00:29:00,720 --> 00:29:02,920
So you can see yourself
ever leaving, then?

451
00:29:00,720 --> 00:29:02,920
那么你可以看到自己
离开了吗？

452
00:29:04,560 --> 00:29:06,839
Well, I'm not going to
live with my dad forever

452
00:29:04,560 --> 00:29:06,839
好吧，我不会
永远和我爸爸住在一起

453
00:29:06,840 --> 00:29:08,480
but I could never be too far away.

453
00:29:06,840 --> 00:29:08,480
但我永远不会离得太远。

454
00:29:11,120 --> 00:29:13,080
I can't expect you to understand that.

454
00:29:11,120 --> 00:29:13,080
我不能指望你明白这一点。

455
00:29:16,360 --> 00:29:18,159
No.

455
00:29:16,360 --> 00:29:18,159
不。

456
00:29:18,160 --> 00:29:19,720
You're probably right.

456
00:29:18,160 --> 00:29:19,720
你也许是对的。

457
00:29:37,440 --> 00:29:39,799
Is there a spare one of those going?

457
00:29:37,440 --> 00:29:39,799
有空的吗？

458
00:29:39,800 --> 00:29:41,399
Coming right up.

458
00:29:39,800 --> 00:29:41,399
马上就来。

459
00:29:41,400 --> 00:29:44,479
Its not the good stuff I'm afraid,
Siegfried would kill me.

459
00:29:41,400 --> 00:29:44,479
恐怕这不是什么好东西，
齐格弗里德会杀了我。

460
00:29:44,480 --> 00:29:47,800
As long as it's strong and large,
I don't care.

460
00:29:44,480 --> 00:29:47,800
只要它又大又壮，
我不在乎。

461
00:29:55,560 --> 00:29:57,000
Want to talk about it?

461
00:29:55,560 --> 00:29:57,000
想谈谈吗？

462
00:29:59,600 --> 00:30:01,839
Not really.

462
00:29:59,600 --> 00:30:01,839
并不真地。

463
00:30:01,840 --> 00:30:03,519
What have you been up to?

463
00:30:01,840 --> 00:30:03,519
你最近都在做什么？

464
00:30:03,520 --> 00:30:06,879
The usual - disappointing Siegfried,
annoying the neighbours,

464
00:30:03,520 --> 00:30:06,879
惯常的——让齐格弗里德失望，
让邻居们恼火，

465
00:30:06,880 --> 00:30:08,240
creating avian anarchy.

465
00:30:06,880 --> 00:30:08,240
创造鸟类无政府状态。

466
00:30:09,680 --> 00:30:11,399
Siegfried still on your case then?

466
00:30:09,680 --> 00:30:11,399
那么齐格弗里德还在处理你的案子吗？

467
00:30:11,400 --> 00:30:13,759
I think it's his life's work
to be on my case.

467
00:30:11,400 --> 00:30:13,759
我认为
处理我的案子是他毕生的工作。

468
00:30:13,760 --> 00:30:17,479
His magnum opus will be the utter
destruction and destitution

468
00:30:13,760 --> 00:30:17,479
他的代表作将是彻底的
毁灭和贫困

469
00:30:17,480 --> 00:30:18,879
of his little brother.

469
00:30:17,480 --> 00:30:18,879
他的小弟弟。

470
00:30:18,880 --> 00:30:21,479
Did you try standing up to him,
like I suggested?

470
00:30:18,880 --> 00:30:21,479
你有没有
像我建议的那样尝试反抗他？

471
00:30:21,480 --> 00:30:22,759
I did, yes.

471
00:30:21,480 --> 00:30:22,759
我有，是的。

472
00:30:22,760 --> 00:30:24,519
Now it's made everything worse.

472
00:30:22,760 --> 00:30:24,519
现在一切都变得更糟了。

473
00:30:24,520 --> 00:30:26,080
But I've got a plan.

473
00:30:24,520 --> 00:30:26,080
但我有一个计划。

474
00:30:29,720 --> 00:30:31,920
Won't it feel like a shallow victory?

474
00:30:29,720 --> 00:30:31,920
不会感觉像是一场肤浅的胜利吗？

475
00:30:33,040 --> 00:30:34,880
A victory is a victory nonetheless.

475
00:30:33,040 --> 00:30:34,880
总之胜利就是胜利。

476
00:30:43,960 --> 00:30:45,440
Hello.

476
00:30:43,960 --> 00:30:45,440
你好。

477
00:30:50,080 --> 00:30:51,600
Look at that!

477
00:30:50,080 --> 00:30:51,600
看那个！

478
00:30:56,680 --> 00:30:58,840
He's only gone and bloody done it.

478
00:30:56,680 --> 00:30:58,840
他只是走了而且该死的做到了。

479
00:31:03,840 --> 00:31:06,880
The taste of a fresh egg,
can't beat it.

479
00:31:03,840 --> 00:31:06,880
新鲜鸡蛋的味道，
无法打败它。

480
00:31:10,320 --> 00:31:13,039
Are you heading up to
the Dalby's today?

480
00:31:10,320 --> 00:31:13,039
你
今天要去 Dalby's 吗？

481
00:31:13,040 --> 00:31:14,479
Unfortunately, yes.

481
00:31:13,040 --> 00:31:14,479
不幸的是，是的。

482
00:31:14,480 --> 00:31:17,559
I have no idea what to say to the
poor woman. I could see the look

482
00:31:14,480 --> 00:31:17,559
我不知道该对这个
可怜的女人说什么。我可以看到外观

483
00:31:17,560 --> 00:31:20,760
of hope on her face when I gave
the stirks the throat injection.

483
00:31:17,560 --> 00:31:20,760
当我给
马镫喉咙注射时，她的脸上充满了希望。

484
00:31:23,000 --> 00:31:24,279
I don't know.

484
00:31:23,000 --> 00:31:24,279
我不知道。

485
00:31:24,280 --> 00:31:27,079
I just don't feel like I'm
being honest.

485
00:31:24,280 --> 00:31:27,079
我只是觉得我
不诚实。

486
00:31:27,080 --> 00:31:28,640
Honesty is the best policy.

486
00:31:27,080 --> 00:31:28,640
诚实是最好的政策。

487
00:31:30,200 --> 00:31:33,279
Of course, the throat injection
was never going to work.

487
00:31:30,200 --> 00:31:33,279
当然，喉咙注射
永远不会奏效。

488
00:31:33,280 --> 00:31:34,559
What?

488
00:31:33,280 --> 00:31:34,559
什么？

489
00:31:34,560 --> 00:31:37,039
But you were the one that told me
to give it to them.

489
00:31:34,560 --> 00:31:37,039
但你是那个告诉我
把它给他们的人。

490
00:31:37,040 --> 00:31:38,680
This isn't about the injection.

490
00:31:37,040 --> 00:31:38,680
这与注射无关。

491
00:31:39,720 --> 00:31:42,199
Look, it's the worst part of the job

491
00:31:39,720 --> 00:31:42,199
看，这是工作中最糟糕的部分

492
00:31:42,200 --> 00:31:45,639
when you realise everything
is in the lap of the gods.

492
00:31:42,200 --> 00:31:45,639
当你意识到一切
都在众神的怀抱中。

493
00:31:45,640 --> 00:31:48,039
But at least now you can
look Phyllis in the eye and tell her

493
00:31:45,640 --> 00:31:48,039
但至少现在你可以
看着菲利斯的眼睛告诉她

494
00:31:48,040 --> 00:31:50,959
you have tried absolutely everything.

494
00:31:48,040 --> 00:31:50,959
你已经尝试了一切。

495
00:31:50,960 --> 00:31:53,239
And as long as you've tried everything,

495
00:31:50,960 --> 00:31:53,239
只要你尝试了一切，

496
00:31:53,240 --> 00:31:54,600
then you've done your job.

496
00:31:53,240 --> 00:31:54,600
那么你就完成了你的工作。

497
00:31:57,000 --> 00:31:59,680
You'll find the right thing to say,
I have no doubt.

497
00:31:57,000 --> 00:31:59,680
你会找到正确的说法，
我毫不怀疑。

498
00:32:02,880 --> 00:32:04,240
Thanks, Siegfried.

498
00:32:02,880 --> 00:32:04,240
谢谢，齐格弗里德。

499
00:32:09,840 --> 00:32:13,799
I know that I can set these high
standards at times,

499
00:32:09,840 --> 00:32:13,799
我知道我
有时可以设定这些高标准，

500
00:32:13,800 --> 00:32:18,039
and perhaps come across
as slightly overbearing...

500
00:32:13,800 --> 00:32:18,039
也许会
让人觉得有点霸道......

501
00:32:18,040 --> 00:32:19,240
Slightly.

501
00:32:18,040 --> 00:32:19,240
轻微地。

502
00:32:21,480 --> 00:32:24,120
It's only because I want
the best for you both.

502
00:32:21,480 --> 00:32:24,120
只是因为我想
给你们俩最好的。

503
00:32:25,680 --> 00:32:27,880
And, Tristan, maybe I should
trust you a bit more.

503
00:32:25,680 --> 00:32:27,880
而且，特里斯坦，也许我应该多
信任你一点。

504
00:32:29,280 --> 00:32:30,560
And...

504
00:32:29,280 --> 00:32:30,560
和...

505
00:32:31,600 --> 00:32:34,040
..recognise your successes
when you have them.

505
00:32:31,600 --> 00:32:34,040
..
当你拥有成功时就承认你的成功。

506
00:32:39,520 --> 00:32:41,159
It's a week's wage.

506
00:32:39,520 --> 00:32:41,159
这是一周的工资。

507
00:32:41,160 --> 00:32:42,439
Well done.

507
00:32:41,160 --> 00:32:42,439
做得好。

508
00:32:42,440 --> 00:32:44,039
You were right about the hens

508
00:32:42,440 --> 00:32:44,039
你对母鸡的看法是对的

509
00:32:44,040 --> 00:32:46,640
and you've more than proved
yourself of late.

509
00:32:44,040 --> 00:32:46,640
而且你最近证明了
自己。

510
00:32:50,200 --> 00:32:51,839
Thanks, Siegfried.

510
00:32:50,200 --> 00:32:51,839
谢谢，齐格弗里德。

511
00:32:51,840 --> 00:32:53,200
You've earned it.

511
00:32:51,840 --> 00:32:53,200
这是你应得的。

512
00:33:05,440 --> 00:33:07,640
Actually, I've got
a confession to make.

512
00:33:05,440 --> 00:33:07,640
事实上，我有
一个忏悔。

513
00:33:10,400 --> 00:33:11,880
I think I'd better get going.

513
00:33:10,400 --> 00:33:11,880
我想我最好走。

514
00:33:12,920 --> 00:33:14,160
Confession?

514
00:33:12,920 --> 00:33:14,160
告白？

515
00:33:17,760 --> 00:33:20,999
It's just, I wanted
so desperately to make you proud

515
00:33:17,760 --> 00:33:20,999
只是，我
拼命想让你骄傲

516
00:33:21,000 --> 00:33:23,280
and do something right for
a change and...

516
00:33:21,000 --> 00:33:23,280
并为
改变做一些正确的事情......

517
00:33:26,640 --> 00:33:28,080
..I lied.

517
00:33:26,640 --> 00:33:28,080
..我撒了谎。

518
00:33:29,280 --> 00:33:31,239
I bought the eggs from the grocers
and planted them

518
00:33:29,280 --> 00:33:31,239
我从杂货店买了鸡蛋
然后种了

519
00:33:31,240 --> 00:33:32,600
in the nest box last night.

519
00:33:31,240 --> 00:33:32,600
昨晚在巢箱里。

520
00:33:34,360 --> 00:33:35,560
Here.

520
00:33:34,360 --> 00:33:35,560
这里。

521
00:33:40,680 --> 00:33:42,079
Right...

521
00:33:40,680 --> 00:33:42,079
对...

522
00:33:55,000 --> 00:33:56,639
Take it.

522
00:33:55,000 --> 00:33:56,639
拿着。

523
00:33:56,640 --> 00:33:58,159
We all make mistakes.

523
00:33:56,640 --> 00:33:58,159
我们都会犯错。

524
00:33:58,160 --> 00:34:00,440
The thing is to forgive and...

524
00:33:58,160 --> 00:34:00,440
事情是原谅和...

525
00:34:01,920 --> 00:34:03,120
..learn from them.

525
00:34:01,920 --> 00:34:03,120
..向他们学习。

526
00:34:06,200 --> 00:34:08,359
What mistakes?

526
00:34:06,200 --> 00:34:08,359
什么错误？

527
00:34:08,360 --> 00:34:12,239
Well, it might have been me
that left the barn door open.

527
00:34:08,360 --> 00:34:12,239
好吧，可能是我
把谷仓的门打开了。

528
00:34:12,240 --> 00:34:14,920
In my defence, Tricky had just
been attacked and...

528
00:34:12,240 --> 00:34:14,920
在我的辩护中，Tricky 刚刚
遭到袭击并且……

529
00:34:16,640 --> 00:34:18,999
I suppose that makes us even,
doesn't it?

529
00:34:16,640 --> 00:34:18,999
我想这会让我们变得平等，
不是吗？

530
00:34:19,000 --> 00:34:20,960
Does it?
I'd take it if I were you.

530
00:34:19,000 --> 00:34:20,960
可以？
如果我是你，我会接受。

531
00:34:24,160 --> 00:34:25,520
I'll get it.

531
00:34:24,160 --> 00:34:25,520
我会得到它的。

532
00:34:30,720 --> 00:34:32,120
Thanks, Siegfried.

532
00:34:30,720 --> 00:34:32,120
谢谢，齐格弗里德。

533
00:34:47,600 --> 00:34:49,039
I see you've lost another one.

533
00:34:47,600 --> 00:34:49,039
我看你又丢了一个。

534
00:34:49,040 --> 00:34:50,759
We have.

534
00:34:49,040 --> 00:34:50,759
我们有。

535
00:34:50,760 --> 00:34:54,159
But Mrs Dalby's sure she noticed an
improvement in the others' appetite.

535
00:34:50,760 --> 00:34:54,159
但多尔比夫人确信她注意到
其他人的胃口有所改善。

536
00:34:54,160 --> 00:34:56,399
That must be a good sign.

536
00:34:54,160 --> 00:34:56,399
这一定是个好兆头。

537
00:34:56,400 --> 00:34:58,280
Let's go have a look at them, shall we?

537
00:34:56,400 --> 00:34:58,280
我们去看看他们好吗？

538
00:35:09,960 --> 00:35:12,119
How are they looking, Mr Herriot?

538
00:35:09,960 --> 00:35:12,119
他们看起来怎么样，赫里奥特先生？

539
00:35:12,120 --> 00:35:15,479
I wish I had some better news,
but they're still very sick.

539
00:35:12,120 --> 00:35:15,479
我希望我有一些更好的消息，
但他们仍然病得很重。

540
00:35:15,480 --> 00:35:18,079
Now, I know you've told me
not to turn the young beasts

540
00:35:15,480 --> 00:35:18,079
现在，我知道你告诉过我
不要让这些年轻的野兽

541
00:35:18,080 --> 00:35:22,320
out onto the field any more,
but isn't there a way around it?

541
00:35:18,080 --> 00:35:22,320
不再进入球场，
但没有办法绕过它吗？

542
00:35:23,320 --> 00:35:25,679
Perhaps it could help to get them
back outside.

542
00:35:23,320 --> 00:35:25,679
也许这有助于让他们
回到外面。

543
00:35:25,680 --> 00:35:26,959
No, I'm sorry.

543
00:35:25,680 --> 00:35:26,959
不，我很抱歉。

544
00:35:26,960 --> 00:35:29,719
Until there's a vaccine,
there's no way of safeguarding them

544
00:35:26,960 --> 00:35:29,719
在没有疫苗之前，
没有办法保护它们

545
00:35:29,720 --> 00:35:30,920
against husk.

545
00:35:29,720 --> 00:35:30,920
对壳。

546
00:35:32,080 --> 00:35:35,239
Then we will just have to find
another solution.

546
00:35:32,080 --> 00:35:35,239
然后我们只需要找到
另一个解决方案。

547
00:35:35,240 --> 00:35:36,440
I...

547
00:35:35,240 --> 00:35:36,440
一世...

548
00:35:38,520 --> 00:35:40,319
Mrs Dalby,

548
00:35:38,520 --> 00:35:40,319
达尔比夫人，

549
00:35:40,320 --> 00:35:43,200
this is what I've been meaning to
talk to you about.

549
00:35:40,320 --> 00:35:43,200
这就是我一直想
和你谈的。

550
00:35:45,680 --> 00:35:49,919
I've been giving the matter a great
deal of thought and, well,

550
00:35:45,680 --> 00:35:49,919
我一直在考虑这个问题
，嗯，

551
00:35:49,920 --> 00:35:51,400
you've lost so much already...

551
00:35:49,920 --> 00:35:51,400
你已经失去了很多...

552
00:35:53,200 --> 00:35:56,760
I just couldn't live with myself if
I didn't give you my honest opinion.

552
00:35:53,200 --> 00:35:56,760
如果
我不给你我诚实的意见，我就无法忍受自己。

553
00:35:59,960 --> 00:36:01,440
I see.

553
00:35:59,960 --> 00:36:01,440
我知道了。

554
00:36:03,560 --> 00:36:05,159
I'm so sorry.

554
00:36:03,560 --> 00:36:05,159
我很抱歉。

555
00:36:05,160 --> 00:36:08,479
I really am, but we've tried
everything now, and there's still

555
00:36:05,160 --> 00:36:08,479
我真的是，但我们
现在已经尝试了一切，仍然有

556
00:36:08,480 --> 00:36:11,560
a very real chance you could end up
losing the entire herd.

556
00:36:08,480 --> 00:36:11,560
一个非常真实的机会，你最终可能会
失去整个牛群。

557
00:36:13,280 --> 00:36:15,480
So there's a chance that we
might not then?

557
00:36:13,280 --> 00:36:15,480
那么我们有
可能不会吗？

558
00:36:16,560 --> 00:36:18,560
A slim one, yes.

558
00:36:16,560 --> 00:36:18,560
一个苗条的，是的。

559
00:36:25,880 --> 00:36:28,080
I've given you so much
false hope already.

559
00:36:25,880 --> 00:36:28,080
我已经给了你太多
虚假的希望。

560
00:36:32,240 --> 00:36:36,279
I really think that now your best
course of action is to sell

560
00:36:32,240 --> 00:36:36,279
我真的认为现在你最好
的做法是出售

561
00:36:36,280 --> 00:36:38,520
the farm before it's too late.

561
00:36:36,280 --> 00:36:38,520
在为时已晚之前的农场。

562
00:36:42,160 --> 00:36:44,719
There's nothing false about hope,
Mr Herriot.

562
00:36:42,160 --> 00:36:44,719
希望并没有什么虚假，
赫里奥特先生。

563
00:36:44,720 --> 00:36:48,000
Yes, but...
I appreciate your honesty, I do.

563
00:36:44,720 --> 00:36:48,000
是的，但是……
我很欣赏你的诚实，我很欣赏。

564
00:36:50,320 --> 00:36:53,239
But I've been giving it a great
deal of thought too,

564
00:36:50,320 --> 00:36:53,239
但我也
想了很多，

565
00:36:53,240 --> 00:36:55,080
and I understand the risk involved.

565
00:36:53,240 --> 00:36:55,080
我了解所涉及的风险。

566
00:36:57,560 --> 00:36:59,560
But, when I look around...

566
00:36:57,560 --> 00:36:59,560
但是，当我环顾四周时...

567
00:37:01,080 --> 00:37:05,119
..I don't just see the things
I've lost or might lose,

567
00:37:01,080 --> 00:37:05,119
..我不只是看到
我已经失去或可能失去的东西，

568
00:37:05,120 --> 00:37:07,400
I see everything I have.

568
00:37:05,120 --> 00:37:07,400
我看到了我所拥有的一切。

569
00:37:10,960 --> 00:37:12,440
I see my boys.

569
00:37:10,960 --> 00:37:12,440
我看到了我的孩子们。

570
00:37:14,280 --> 00:37:16,760
How I have so much
worth fighting for still.

570
00:37:14,280 --> 00:37:16,760
我怎么还有那么多
值得为之奋斗的东西。

571
00:37:18,920 --> 00:37:21,839
And I owe it to them,
to my family, not to give up.

571
00:37:18,920 --> 00:37:21,839
我欠他们，欠
我的家人，不要放弃。

572
00:37:21,840 --> 00:37:24,520
Even if it is the slimmest
of chances, I'll take it.

572
00:37:21,840 --> 00:37:24,520
哪怕是最渺茫
的机会，我也要把握住。

573
00:37:29,680 --> 00:37:32,599
I might not have been able to
save my husband, Mr Herriot,

573
00:37:29,680 --> 00:37:32,599
我可能
救不了我的丈夫 Herriot 先生

574
00:37:32,600 --> 00:37:34,200
but I can save our farm.

574
00:37:32,600 --> 00:37:34,200
但我可以拯救我们的农场。

575
00:37:35,760 --> 00:37:37,000
Our home.

575
00:37:35,760 --> 00:37:37,000
我们的家。

576
00:37:39,880 --> 00:37:41,200
So we're staying put.

576
00:37:39,880 --> 00:37:41,200
所以我们要原地踏步。

577
00:37:44,960 --> 00:37:47,519
Like my Billy always used to say,

577
00:37:44,960 --> 00:37:47,519
就像我的比利常说的那样，

578
00:37:47,520 --> 00:37:50,320
only them as has them can lose them.

578
00:37:47,520 --> 00:37:50,320
只有拥有它们的人才能失去它们。

579
00:37:52,960 --> 00:37:55,439
Now, come on,
you must have one of these scones,

579
00:37:52,960 --> 00:37:55,439
现在，来吧，
你必须有这些烤饼之一，

580
00:37:55,440 --> 00:37:56,800
they're fresh from the oven.

580
00:37:55,440 --> 00:37:56,800
它们是刚出炉的。

581
00:38:11,160 --> 00:38:13,679
That's it, that's the record.

581
00:38:11,160 --> 00:38:13,679
就是这样，这就是记录。

582
00:38:13,680 --> 00:38:15,160
He's done it!

582
00:38:13,680 --> 00:38:15,160
他做到了！

583
00:38:23,520 --> 00:38:25,160
Brilliant, brilliant.

583
00:38:23,520 --> 00:38:25,160
辉煌，辉煌。

584
00:38:26,640 --> 00:38:28,160
Wonderful.

584
00:38:26,640 --> 00:38:28,160
精彩的。

585
00:38:37,720 --> 00:38:39,040
I'll get it.

585
00:38:37,720 --> 00:38:39,040
我会得到它的。

586
00:38:43,640 --> 00:38:45,640
Tricky, Mummy's here.

586
00:38:43,640 --> 00:38:45,640
棘手，妈妈来了。

587
00:38:48,160 --> 00:38:51,160
Darling, dearest boy,
how have you been?

587
00:38:48,160 --> 00:38:51,160
亲爱的，最亲爱的孩子，
你好吗？

588
00:38:52,320 --> 00:38:54,639
Mrs Pumphrey, do come in.

588
00:38:52,320 --> 00:38:54,639
Pumphrey 夫人，请进。

589
00:38:54,640 --> 00:38:56,479
Thank you.

589
00:38:54,640 --> 00:38:56,479
谢谢你。

590
00:38:56,480 --> 00:38:58,079
Forgive my early arrival,

590
00:38:56,480 --> 00:38:58,079
原谅我早到，

591
00:38:58,080 --> 00:39:01,079
our separation became far too
unbearable.

591
00:38:58,080 --> 00:39:01,079
我们的分离变得太
难以忍受了。

592
00:39:01,080 --> 00:39:03,679
Quite all right.
I'll fetch some tea.

592
00:39:01,080 --> 00:39:03,679
完全没问题。
我去拿点茶。

593
00:39:03,680 --> 00:39:06,199
Do sit down, Mrs Pumphrey.
Allow me.

593
00:39:03,680 --> 00:39:06,199
坐下来，Pumphrey 夫人。
允许我。

594
00:39:06,200 --> 00:39:07,400
Thank you.

594
00:39:06,200 --> 00:39:07,400
谢谢你。

595
00:39:08,600 --> 00:39:13,199
I so appreciate his Uncle Herriot
looking after him so well.

595
00:39:08,600 --> 00:39:13,199
我非常感谢他的赫里奥特叔叔
把他照顾得这么好。

596
00:39:13,200 --> 00:39:14,879
Where is our dear James?

596
00:39:13,200 --> 00:39:14,879
我们亲爱的詹姆斯在哪里？

597
00:39:14,880 --> 00:39:17,039
Out on a call, I'm afraid.

597
00:39:14,880 --> 00:39:17,039
恐怕要出去接电话了。

598
00:39:17,040 --> 00:39:19,039
Oh, what a pity.

598
00:39:17,040 --> 00:39:19,039
噢真可惜。

599
00:39:19,040 --> 00:39:21,039
How was your trip?

599
00:39:19,040 --> 00:39:21,039
你的旅途怎么样？

600
00:39:21,040 --> 00:39:24,839
Hutton and Leyland made quite the pair.

600
00:39:21,040 --> 00:39:24,839
Hutton 和 Leyland 是一对。

601
00:39:24,840 --> 00:39:28,799
I almost dropped my binoculars
in all the excitement.

601
00:39:24,840 --> 00:39:28,799
我
兴奋得差点丢掉双筒望远镜。

602
00:39:28,800 --> 00:39:31,199
We just heard,
Hutton beat Bradman's record.

602
00:39:28,800 --> 00:39:31,199
我们刚刚听说，
赫顿打破了布拉德曼的记录。

603
00:39:31,200 --> 00:39:33,039
Terrific!

603
00:39:31,200 --> 00:39:33,039
了不起！

604
00:39:33,040 --> 00:39:36,359
Which reminds me, I do hope you are
practising your inswinger,

604
00:39:33,040 --> 00:39:36,359
这让我想起了，我确实希望你正在
练习你的浪荡公子，

605
00:39:36,360 --> 00:39:38,879
ready for
my little cricket match this summer.

605
00:39:36,360 --> 00:39:38,879
准备好参加
今年夏天的小板球比赛。

606
00:39:38,880 --> 00:39:41,559
Of course, wouldn't miss it for the
world, Mrs Pumphrey.

606
00:39:38,880 --> 00:39:41,559
当然，
全世界都不会错过的，Pumphrey 夫人。

607
00:39:41,560 --> 00:39:43,719
Wonderful.

607
00:39:41,560 --> 00:39:43,719
精彩的。

608
00:39:43,720 --> 00:39:46,119
Look, Tricky, your favourite.

608
00:39:43,720 --> 00:39:46,119
看，Tricky，你最喜欢的。

609
00:39:46,120 --> 00:39:48,959
He does love a home-made biscuit.

609
00:39:46,120 --> 00:39:48,959
他确实喜欢自制饼干。

610
00:39:48,960 --> 00:39:51,199
They're actually for you, Mrs Pumphrey.

610
00:39:48,960 --> 00:39:51,199
他们实际上是给你的，Pumphrey 夫人。

611
00:39:51,200 --> 00:39:52,719
Oh, I only eat a Fortnum myself.

611
00:39:51,200 --> 00:39:52,719
哦，我自己只吃一个Fortnum。

612
00:39:52,720 --> 00:39:55,239
But Tricky is a little less fussy.

612
00:39:52,720 --> 00:39:55,239
但 Tricky 就不那么挑剔了。

613
00:39:55,240 --> 00:39:56,759
And how was my darling boy been?

613
00:39:55,240 --> 00:39:56,759
我亲爱的男孩过得怎么样？

614
00:39:56,760 --> 00:39:58,480
I do hope he has behaved himself.

614
00:39:56,760 --> 00:39:58,480
我确实希望他表现得很好。

615
00:39:59,760 --> 00:40:01,080
Well...

615
00:39:59,760 --> 00:40:01,080
好...

616
00:40:02,360 --> 00:40:03,599
Honesty...

616
00:40:02,360 --> 00:40:03,599
诚实...

617
00:40:03,600 --> 00:40:04,800
Yes, um...

617
00:40:03,600 --> 00:40:04,800
是的，嗯...

618
00:40:05,960 --> 00:40:09,159
Truth be told, there was
a slight incident.

618
00:40:05,960 --> 00:40:09,159
说实话，发生
了一件小事。

619
00:40:09,160 --> 00:40:13,159
I took temporary charge
of Tricky while James...

619
00:40:09,160 --> 00:40:13,159
我临时负责
Tricky，而 James...

620
00:40:13,160 --> 00:40:16,719
While Uncle Herriot was on a call,

620
00:40:13,160 --> 00:40:16,719
当赫里奥特叔叔打电话时，

621
00:40:16,720 --> 00:40:19,559
turned my back for a second

621
00:40:16,720 --> 00:40:19,559
转过我一秒

622
00:40:19,560 --> 00:40:25,639
and Tricky did receive a tiny
peck from one of our hens.

622
00:40:19,560 --> 00:40:25,639
Tricky 确实
从我们的一只母鸡那里得到了一点点啄。

623
00:40:25,640 --> 00:40:29,399
I take full responsibility,
I'm terribly sorry.

623
00:40:25,640 --> 00:40:29,399
我承担全部责任，
非常抱歉。

624
00:40:29,400 --> 00:40:31,679
Tricky always goes
completely cracker-dog

624
00:40:29,400 --> 00:40:31,679
Tricky 总是
完全变态

625
00:40:31,680 --> 00:40:33,679
when there's a chicken in sight.

625
00:40:31,680 --> 00:40:33,679
当看到一只鸡时。

626
00:40:33,680 --> 00:40:36,119
Tricky woo-lally I call it.

626
00:40:33,680 --> 00:40:36,119
棘手的 woo-lally 我称之为。

627
00:40:36,120 --> 00:40:38,039
I couldn't tell you what
he has against them

627
00:40:36,120 --> 00:40:38,039
我无法告诉你
他对他们有什么不满

628
00:40:38,040 --> 00:40:41,359
but that will be the fifth peck
he has had this year.

628
00:40:38,040 --> 00:40:41,359
但这将是
他今年的第五次啄食。

629
00:40:41,360 --> 00:40:43,199
Oh, right.

629
00:40:41,360 --> 00:40:43,199
啊对。

630
00:40:43,200 --> 00:40:46,839
Perhaps it's because he's an only dog.

630
00:40:43,200 --> 00:40:46,839
也许是因为他是唯一的狗。

631
00:40:46,840 --> 00:40:51,439
I do think that an only
develops more prejudices

631
00:40:46,840 --> 00:40:51,439
我确实认为只会
产生更多的偏见

632
00:40:51,440 --> 00:40:52,960
than one from a large family.

632
00:40:51,440 --> 00:40:52,960
比一个来自大家庭的人。

633
00:40:54,000 --> 00:40:55,680
Wouldn't you agree?

633
00:40:54,000 --> 00:40:55,680
你不同意吗？

634
00:40:59,960 --> 00:41:02,200
Try not to be upset.

634
00:40:59,960 --> 00:41:02,200
尽量不要生气。

635
00:41:03,320 --> 00:41:05,800
You will see your uncles
again very soon.

635
00:41:03,320 --> 00:41:05,800
你
很快就会再次见到你的叔叔。

636
00:41:07,200 --> 00:41:10,840
And the pain of parting is
nothing to the joy of meeting again.

636
00:41:07,200 --> 00:41:10,840
而离别之痛，
与重逢之乐无关。

637
00:41:13,160 --> 00:41:15,319
Thank you.

637
00:41:13,160 --> 00:41:15,319
谢谢你。

638
00:41:15,320 --> 00:41:16,640
Good day, Mrs Pumphrey.

638
00:41:15,320 --> 00:41:16,640
美好的一天，庞弗里夫人。

639
00:41:17,800 --> 00:41:19,160
Goodbye, Tricky.

639
00:41:17,800 --> 00:41:19,160
再见，崔克。

640
00:41:20,200 --> 00:41:23,119
Oh, of course, Tricky, yes,
where are my manners?

640
00:41:20,200 --> 00:41:23,119
哦，当然，Tricky，是的，
我的礼貌在哪里？

641
00:41:23,120 --> 00:41:24,840
Francois, would you mind?

641
00:41:23,120 --> 00:41:24,840
弗朗索瓦，你介意吗？

642
00:41:26,560 --> 00:41:27,800
You reminded me...

642
00:41:26,560 --> 00:41:27,800
你提醒我...

643
00:41:30,480 --> 00:41:32,319
To say thank you.

643
00:41:30,480 --> 00:41:32,319
要说谢谢。

644
00:41:32,320 --> 00:41:33,560
Oh.

644
00:41:32,320 --> 00:41:33,560
哦。

645
00:41:34,560 --> 00:41:35,960
To his Uncle Herriot.

645
00:41:34,560 --> 00:41:35,960
给他的赫里奥特叔叔。

646
00:41:38,280 --> 00:41:40,280
The kippers - exquisite.

646
00:41:38,280 --> 00:41:40,280
腌鱼 - 精致。

647
00:41:42,400 --> 00:41:45,639
Right, home, please, Francois.

647
00:41:42,400 --> 00:41:45,639
好的，请回家，弗朗索瓦。

648
00:41:45,640 --> 00:41:47,479
Toodle-oo.

648
00:41:45,640 --> 00:41:47,479
嘟嘟哦。

649
00:41:47,480 --> 00:41:49,080
Bye-bye.

649
00:41:47,480 --> 00:41:49,080
再见。

650
00:41:50,640 --> 00:41:52,000
Come on!

650
00:41:50,640 --> 00:41:52,000
来吧！

651
00:42:33,840 --> 00:42:35,360
Phyllis lost another stirk.

651
00:42:33,840 --> 00:42:35,360
菲利斯又失去了一根鞭子。

652
00:42:36,880 --> 00:42:38,520
A few more are on their way out.

652
00:42:36,880 --> 00:42:38,520
还有一些正在离开。

653
00:42:39,880 --> 00:42:42,279
But she is determined to keep going,

653
00:42:39,880 --> 00:42:42,279
但她决心继续前进，

654
00:42:42,280 --> 00:42:44,000
even if it's only with half a herd.

654
00:42:42,280 --> 00:42:44,000
即使只有半群。

655
00:42:45,720 --> 00:42:46,999
You were right.

655
00:42:45,720 --> 00:42:46,999
你是对的。

656
00:42:47,000 --> 00:42:49,720
I get it now, and I'm sorry about...

656
00:42:47,000 --> 00:42:49,720
我现在明白了，我很抱歉...

657
00:43:04,160 --> 00:43:06,920
This was my mum's favourite spot
up here on this roof.

657
00:43:04,160 --> 00:43:06,920
这是我妈妈
在这个屋顶上最喜欢的地方。

658
00:43:08,640 --> 00:43:12,439
Used to come up here at lunchtime
and eat our sandwiches.

658
00:43:08,640 --> 00:43:12,439
过去常常在午餐时间来这里
吃我们的三明治。

659
00:43:12,440 --> 00:43:16,679
She'd point out different
parts of the farm and tell me,

659
00:43:12,440 --> 00:43:16,679
她会指出
农场的不同部分并告诉我，

660
00:43:16,680 --> 00:43:19,760
"That's where you scraped your knee
trying to jump over the bales."

660
00:43:16,680 --> 00:43:19,760
“这就是你
试图跳过大包时擦伤膝盖的地方。”

661
00:43:21,320 --> 00:43:24,120
"That's where you helped out
with your first lambing."

661
00:43:21,320 --> 00:43:24,120
“那是你帮助
你第一次产羔的地方。”

662
00:43:28,440 --> 00:43:30,040
"And that spot there..."

662
00:43:28,440 --> 00:43:30,040
“还有那个地方……”

663
00:43:33,200 --> 00:43:35,640
"..that's where I told your dad
I were pregnant with you."

663
00:43:33,200 --> 00:43:35,640
“……那是我告诉你爸爸
我怀了你的地方。”

664
00:43:37,120 --> 00:43:39,320
"And his grin filled
his whole face."

664
00:43:37,120 --> 00:43:39,320
“他的笑容充满
了他的整张脸。”
