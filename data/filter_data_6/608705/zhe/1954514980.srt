这样吧 简单点
Tell you what,I'll make it easy for you.

137
00:12:40,880 --> 00:12:43,758
我把这个Q的一个角折起来 象这样
I'll take the Queen,turn the corner up.Like that.

138
00:12:47,440 --> 00:12:48,793

Here we go.

139
00:12:55,520 --> 00:12:59,229
选一张 不来钱 你错了 就请我喝一杯

00:13:06,160 --> 00:13:08,515
- 再来一杯 - 真是个讨人厌的家伙
- Same again,please. - You're a very sick person.

141
00:13:08,600 --> 00:13:10,431
只是天赋而已
Just naturally gifted.

142
00:13:12,120 --> 00:13:14,395
听说了嘛 Mickey Bricks放出来了
You heard Mickey Bricks is out?

143
00:13:15,680 --> 00:13:18,956
- 那个诈骗行家? - 最终的赢家
- Plays the long con,right? - Top of the food chain.

144
00:13:19,920 --> 00:13:23,037
怎么样?你认为他能教我些什么?
So what?You reckon he could teach me something?

145
00:13:23,160 --> 00:13:26,311
我怎么知道?你们这帮家伙都让我崇拜
What do I know?All you guys freak me out.

146
00:13:26,560 --> 00:13:29,074
不过 他们都说他是最棒的
But they say he's the best.

147
00:13:32,640 --> 00:13:35,234
他现在住在London Park酒店
He's booked in the London Park Hotel.

148
00:13:35,520 --> 00:13:37,670

谢谢
Thank you.

150
00:13:47,440 --> 00:13:49,078
为你们干杯 先生们
Here's to you,gentlemen.

151
00:13:49,160 --> 00:13:52,072
我一直认为世界上 不可能再有诚实的人了
I didn't think there were any honest men left in the world.

152
00:13:52,160 --> 00:13:54,594
- 仅剩一两个了吧 - 那就为诚实的人们干杯!
- One or two. - Here's to honest men.

153
00:13:56,920 --> 00:14:01,198
- 该让我好好的感谢你们一番 - 不 不 我们不是冲这个来的
- You must let me thank you properly. - No.We wouldn't hear of it.

154
00:14:01,280 --> 00:14:03,794
就当是回家的车费
Even if it's only the cab fare home.

155
00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:05,319
稍等一下
Excuse me.

156
00:14:33,320 --> 00:14:34,753
说到哪儿了?
Where were we?

157
00:14:34,840 --> 00:14:39,118
哦 是的 我在极力说服你们 收取你们应得的回报
I was trying to persuade you to take something in return for your kindness.

158
00:14:39,200 --> 00:14:41,302
是不是大家都认为"有钱能使鬼推磨"
It's a strange state of affairs

159
00:14:41,303 --> 00:14:43,034
一旦有人做了拾金不昧的善举
if one chap can't do a favor for another...

160
00:14:43,120 --> 00:14:45,111
反而会显得格格不入?
without money rearing its ugly head.

161
00:14:45,200 --> 00:14:49,034
有一天你也会有机会来帮助我们的
One day you may be in a position to do something similar for us.

162
00:14:49,120 --> 00:14:52,795
你知道 我有可能...我有个建议

If you'll allow me,I'll put in,say,?00 for you?

165
00:15:05,200 --> 00:15:08,795
我把给你们的钱作为投资基金 你们等着收利润就行
I'll take the ?00 back,you just get to keep the profit.

166
00:15:10,360 --> 00:15:11,759
那对我来说没什么损失
It'll have cost me nothing...

167
00:15:11,840 --> 00:15:15,469
不过 我能感觉好点 好歹我为你们做了点事
but at least I'll feel happier knowing I've done something.

168
00:15:16,720 --> 00:15:18,836
真是慷慨!
That sounds very generous.

169
00:15:19,760 --> 00:15:20,875

这项投资 我能问下是关于什么的吗?
This investment,can I ask what it is?

172
00:15:28,400 --> 00:15:31,358
就是些股票什么 没什么新鲜的
Just stocks and shares.Nothing too exciting.

173
00:15:32,160 --> 00:15:33,513
但愿是真的
Fingers crossed.

174
00:15:33,920 --> 00:15:36,275
我确信 那并不重要
I'm sure that won't be necessary.

175
00:15:45,560 --> 00:15:49,553
- 你觉得怎么样? - 我觉得象是个稳赚不赔的买卖
- What do you think? - Looks like a no-Iose situation to me.

176
00:15:49,640 --> 00:15:51,312
我就喜欢这种
My favorite kind.

177
00:15:51,760 --> 00:15:53,751
他们大约1小时前离开
They left about an hour ago.

178
00:15:53,840 --> 00:15:57,150
Stroller离开Williams之后 又重新回到酒店
Stroller dropped Williams off,then went back to the hotel.

179
00:16:05,480 --> 00:16:08,756

这家伙显然很有兴趣
This guy moves in high circles.

182
00:16:22,480 --> 00:16:24,710
我要找些特别的东西刺激下他
It'll take something special to impress him.

183
00:16:24,800 --> 00:16:26,472
一旦Ash施展出他的魔法
That's exactly what he'll get.

184
00:16:26,560 --> 00:16:29,028
他一定会如愿以偿的
As soon as Ash starts working his magic.

185
00:16:29,120 --> 00:16:31,759
有没有想要找个年轻女郎 Albie?
Have you ever thought of a younger woman,Albie?

186
00:16:31,840 --> 00:16:34,718
亲爱的 象我这样的年纪 还能想其他的吗?
My dear,at my age,I think of little else.

Mickey Bricks还没有足够的钱 来实施这次的诈骗
Mickey Bricks doesn't have the money to bankroll a con like this.

208

00:21:19,440 --> 00:21:21,556
别怪我多管闲事 不过我觉得...

等等 我在想 我们为什么不再投资一回?
Wait.I mean,why don't we go again?

233
00:21:38,400 --> 00:21:39,719
再投资?
Again?

When I gave you that money,I did,for one second,consider the possibility...

274
00:27:55,720 --> 00:27:57,472
- 这边走 - 谢谢
- Right this way. - Thank you.

275
00:28:10,840 --> 00:28:13,229
明白 查到他的真实身份了
Got it.They've got a positive ID.

276
00:28:14,080 --> 00:28:16,640
他叫Danny Blue 高明的小偷
He's a short con artist called Danny Blue.

277
00:28:16,840 --> 00:28:17,989
犯罪记录?
Any history?

278
00:28:18,120 --> 00:28:20,839
3个月前他在南部实施过一次诈骗
He played a con three months ago,south of the river.

279
00:28:20,920 --> 00:28:22,592
不过 受害者撤消了控诉
But the mark withdrew his complaint...

280
00:28:22,680 --> 00:28:24,557
CPS也没有证据提起诉讼
and CPS wouldn't prosecute without evidence.

281
00:28:24,640 --> 00:28:26,198
为什么撤消了?
Why did he pull out?

282
00:28:26,320 --> 00:28:28,834
受害者把毕生积蓄都花在赌马上了
The mark bet his life savings in a horseracing scam...

283
00:28:28,920 --> 00:28:30,990
他的妻子却毫不知情
but his wife didn't know anything about it.

284
00:28:31,080 --> 00:28:33,116
我想 他并不想让她知道
I suppose he wanted to keep it that way.

285
00:28:33,200 --> 00:28:35,589
估计解释起来很费时间
Hard to explain over breakfast,I guess.

286
00:28:36,480 --> 00:28:41,110
正如他们所说的:总有人会上钩的
It must be true what they say:"There's one born every minute."

287
00:28:53,680 --> 00:28:56,240
先生们 请进!坐吧
Gentlemen,come in.Take a seat.

288
00:28:58,040 --> 00:28:59,109
谢谢
Thank you.

289
00:28:59,840 --> 00:29:01,319
抱歉 伙计 我来迟了
Sorry I'm late,guys.

290
00:29:04,320 --> 00:29:05,958
遇到了个老朋友
Ran into an old friend.

291
00:29:07,720 --> 00:29:11,395
先生们 欢迎来到"富饶之地"
Gentlemen,welcome to the land of plenty.

292
00:29:12,720 --> 00:29:13,789
谢谢
Thank you.

293
00:29:14,320 --> 00:29:17,278
接下来我所讲的事 或许是十分安全的
What I'm about to show you may be foolproof...

294
00:29:17,360 --> 00:29:19,191
但也是违反法律的
but it's also illegal.

295
00:29:19,480 --> 00:29:21,948
不会有人吃亏 但却违背了法律
There's no victim,but it's against the law.

296
00:29:22,040 --> 00:29:23,951
你们还想继续听吗?
Would you like me to continue?

297
00:29:34,240 --> 00:29:36,754
听好 诈骗守则之一
You see,the first rule of the con...

298
00:29:37,240 --> 00:29:40,516
- 你不能欺骗老实人 - 绝对不可以
- ...is you can't cheat an honest man. - It's never been done.

299
00:29:40,600 --> 00:29:42,318
- 不能这样做 - 绝对不行
- Can't happen. - Impossible.

300
00:29:42,400 --> 00:29:44,994
那只会让你空手而归
It only works if you want something for nothing.

301
00:29:45,080 --> 00:29:48,038
- 我们呢? - 我们会一本万利
- What do we do? - We give you nothing for something.

302
00:29:48,120 --> 00:29:49,792
目前你得到了1000英镑
You're ?,000 up so far.

303
00:29:49,880 --> 00:29:51,518
现在最好是 见好就收
It's a very good time to walk away.

304
00:29:51,600 --> 00:29:53,909
- 但是他不会 - 因为他太贪婪了
- But he can't. - Because he's so greedy.

305
00:29:54,200 --> 00:29:56,794
- 那么我们做什么? - 满足他的贪欲
- So what do we do? - Feed the greed.

306
00:29:57,600 --> 00:29:59,830
不过他还有最后一次机会
But he's got one last chance.

307
00:30:01,360 --> 00:30:03,112
我们告诉他那是违法的
We've told him it's illegal.

308
00:30:03,200 --> 00:30:06,078
你可能血本无归
You could lose everything.

309
00:30:06,400 --> 00:30:10,188
- 事业 妻子 家庭 - 最后进监狱
- Career,wife,home. - Prison.

310
00:30:10,680 --> 00:30:12,238
你可以马上退出
Get out while you can.

311
00:30:13,560 --> 00:30:15,357
聪明点吧!
Do the smart thing.

312
00:30:17,800 --> 00:30:20,473
正如我所说的 我要告诉你们的事
As I was saying,what I'm about to show you...

313
00:30:20,560 --> 00:30:22,994
也许毫无风险 但却是违法的
may be foolproof,but it's against the law.

314
00:30:23,080 --> 00:30:25,196
现在 你们还想继续嘛?
Now,would you like me to continue?

315
00:30:29,480 --> 00:30:31,630
嘿 制订法律不就是要人去违反嘛
Laws were made to be broken.

316
00:30:35,440 --> 00:30:38,477
告诉Peterson午饭之前 给我所有的分析报告
Can you tell Peterson I want those breakdowns by lunchtime?

317
00:30:38,960 --> 00:30:40,029
谢谢
Thank you.

318
00:30:40,800 --> 00:30:43,234
所有的股票交易所 东京 纽约 
Share transactions from Tokyo and New York...

319
00:30:43,320 --> 00:30:45,788
通过电脑与伦敦相连
are relayed to the city of London by computer.

320
00:30:45,880 --> 00:30:48,917
准确来说 通过<i>我们的</i>电脑
Or more precisely,our computer.

321
00:30:49,000 --> 00:30:53,039
每当一跨国集团公布年报时 交易市场总会引起一阵骚动
When the multi-nationals publish their annual reports,there's a flurry of activity.

322
00:30:53,120 --> 00:30:56,749
如果企业运作不错 吸引股民认购 股票价格上升
If a company does well,their shares attract buyers and the price jumps.

323
00:30:56,840 --> 00:31:00,515
我们所做的就是 使交易延迟足够长的时间
We've managed to delay those transactions in the system long enough...

324
00:31:00,600 --> 00:31:04,275
以便于我们在他们认购之前 买进我们所需要的份额
to assess them and put our own order in to buy before them.

325
00:31:05,360 --> 00:31:07,715
所以 你购买那些一定会升值的股票?
So you buy,knowing the share prices are gonna go up?

326
00:31:07,800 --> 00:31:09,950
- 没错! - 他们会发现交易延迟的吧
- Exactly. - They must notice the delay.

327
00:31:10,040 --> 00:31:12,156
如果只是延迟1/10秒的话 就不会被发现
Not when it's less than nine-tenths of a second.

328
00:31:12,240 --> 00:31:13,832
用不到一秒的时间做这些 行吗?
You can do this in less than a second?

329
00:31:13,920 --> 00:31:17,390
那点时间够我们的主机运行3百万次
Our mainframe can make three million calculations in that time.

330
00:31:17,680 --> 00:31:19,318
你能得到什么好处?
What's in it for you?

331
00:31:19,840 --> 00:31:21,876
25%的利润
I take 25% Of your profit.

332
00:31:21,960 --> 00:31:24,190
- 25%? - 不二价
- <i>25%?</i> - Non-negotiable.

333
00:31:24,360 --> 00:31:27,272
等等 利润是保证的 不是吗?
Hang on.The profit is guaranteed,right?

334
00:31:27,360 --> 00:31:31,035
完全肯定 你们没有利润 我就没钱可赚了
Set in stone.If there's no profit,I don't get paid.

335
00:31:32,640 --> 00:31:37,077
3天后 Vestron石油集团 会发布他们的年报
In three days,the oil company Vestron are releasing their annual report.

336
00:31:37,200 --> 00:31:42,069
一旦公布 股票经纪人会席卷所有的新股
Once it's out,every major broker will be crawling all over those shares.

337
00:31:42,360 --> 00:31:45,238
我们计划购买50万英镑的股票
The plan is to buy ?00,000 worth of shares.

338
00:31:45,320 --> 00:31:48,153
两个客户已经各投资了10万
I have two investors already in place at ?00,000 each.

339
00:31:48,240 --> 00:31:50,071
还剩下三个空缺
There are three places left.

340
00:31:50,520 --> 00:31:52,238
10万?
?00,000?

341
00:31:53,680 --> 00:31:55,398
很好 可以 算我一份
Great,yeah,I'm in.

342
00:31:57,200 --> 00:31:59,395
我不知道能不能筹集到这么多钱...
I don't know if I can raise that kind of money...

343
00:31:59,480 --> 00:32:03,359
不管你上不上船 三天后起航 Tony?
The boat leaves in three days.Either you're on it,or you're not.Tony?

344
00:32:03,960 --> 00:32:06,872
的确数目不小 不过我会弄到的
It's a lot of money,but I'll find it.

345
00:32:13,320 --> 00:32:15,356
不介意我打个电话给我的经纪人吧?
You don't mind if I call my broker?

346
00:32:15,440 --> 00:32:17,715
我只说不能离开这个房间
What I've just said can't leave this room.

347
00:32:17,800 --> 00:32:21,429
我不习惯投资我从没听说过的公司
I'm not in the habit of investing in companies I've never heard of.

348
00:32:26,240 --> 00:32:29,676
George?Peter Williams 关于Vestron你知道多少?
George?Peter Williams.What do you know about Vestron?

349
00:32:34,160 --> 00:32:37,118
不 没什么 只是听到些传言 就这样
No problem.Just heard a whisper,that's all.

350
00:32:38,360 --> 00:32:41,193
不 有问题再找你
No.I'll call you if anything comes of it.

I don't want to leave any paper trails.The money has to be in cash.

354
00:32:57,320 --> 00:32:58,753
- 现金? - 有问题吗?
- Cash? - Problem?

355
00:33:03,280 --> 00:33:05,430

I say something funny?

369
00:35:01,840 --> 00:35:05,515
不是 这个家族并不是为我而生
No.The whole family thing works for me.

370
00:35:06,920 --> 00:35:08,672
你只是干小偷小摸的勾当 Danny
You play short cons,Danny.

371
00:35:08,760 --> 00:35:12,548
只会趁周末掏空别人的工资袋 你不会理解我们在干的事
Emptying people's wage packets on a Friday night.You wouldn't understand.

372
00:35:17,880 --> 00:35:20,440
- 可以提个意见吗? - 当然
- Can I make a criticism? - Okay.

373
00:35:22,600 --> 00:35:24,272
100,000
100,000?

374
00:35:25,800 --> 00:35:28,234
我们能从那家伙身上搞到更多的钱
We can take this guy for a lot more than that.

375
00:35:28,320 --> 00:35:30,197
那正是你需要学的
That's the bit you don't get.

376
00:35:30,880 --> 00:35:32,552
并不是钱多钱少的问题
It's not just about the money.

377
00:35:32,640 --> 00:35:34,437
- 什么时候学? - 一直...
- Since when? - Since always.

378
00:35:34,560 --> 00:35:37,074
你不明白其中的道理 你什么也得不到
You don't get that,you don't get anything.

379
00:35:40,160 --> 00:35:42,754
我的长辈一直就是这么做的
My old man was as straight as they come.

380
00:35:43,920 --> 00:35:47,071
安于现状 悠于生活
Never wanted much and life didn't disappoint him.

381
00:35:47,640 --> 00:35:49,710
他每天工作,吃饭,睡觉
He worked,ate,slept.

382
00:35:49,800 --> 00:35:52,360
按时纳税 中规中矩
Paid his taxes on time,toed the line.

383
00:35:53,040 --> 00:35:56,635
唯一的希望是能在60岁退休
The only dream he had was retiring at 60.

384
00:35:59,800 --> 00:36:04,191
结果就在60岁生日的前三天
Dropped dead in the Post Office three days before his 60th birthday.

385
00:36:05,640 --> 00:36:08,791
在邮局付电话帐单时 撒手人寰
He was paying his phone bill.

386
00:36:11,760 --> 00:36:13,955
- 真遗憾 - 是的 我也觉得
- I'm sorry. - Yeah.Me,too.

387
00:36:17,560 --> 00:36:20,438
你想做个普通人 是吗?
You want to be regular people?Do you?

388
00:36:20,760 --> 00:36:24,389
那就只能边抱怨工作的平凡无奇
Go do that.They're crying out for foot soldiers down there.

389
00:36:24,840 --> 00:36:28,799
边为那些老板,银行家,政客们卖命 仅此而已
Go and have your life run by bosses,bank managers,and politicians.

390
00:36:28,960 --> 00:36:31,428
但如果你真打算当个诈骗高手...
But if you want to be a grifter...

391
00:36:32,240 --> 00:36:36,028
不要带上任何 你无法及时摆脱的累赘
don't have anything in your life you can't walk away from in a second.

392
00:36:36,640 --> 00:36:39,473
爱人 朋友 甚至你的至亲
Lovers,friends,even your own mother.

393
00:36:44,280 --> 00:36:45,793
那你妻子呢?
What about your wife?

394
00:36:48,560 --> 00:36:50,357
我听说了
I heard what happened.

395
00:36:51,320 --> 00:36:54,915
她想我做的 我做不到
She wanted me to be something I wasn't.

396
00:36:55,600 --> 00:36:58,068
我努力的不让她失望
And I was desperate not to disappoint her.

397
00:36:59,280 --> 00:37:00,872
谁想到 后患无穷
Recipe for disaster.

398
00:37:01,080 --> 00:37:02,911
如果你俩还在一起的话...
If you were still together...

399
00:37:03,000 --> 00:37:06,310
你能够做到对她视若无睹吗?
you're telling me you could just walk away from her?

400
00:37:08,840 --> 00:37:10,512
首要原则 Danny
First rule,Danny:

401
00:37:10,920 --> 00:37:12,831
人不为己 天诛地灭
Always look after number one.

402
00:37:14,200 --> 00:37:16,589
人人都会这么做的
If you don't,no one else will.

403
00:37:20,840 --> 00:37:22,592
好的 我会铭记在心的
I'll try and remember that.

404
00:37:22,880 --> 00:37:25,314
回去吧 Danny 去休息会
Go home,Danny.Get some sleep.

405
00:37:47,000 --> 00:37:48,353
Danny Blue?
Danny Blue.

406
00:37:53,800 --> 00:37:55,711

408
00:38:00,640 --> 00:38:01,914
焦躁不安...
Worryingly.

409
00:38:03,440 --> 00:38:04,953
行了 别说了
Okay,come on.

410
00:38:05,960 --> 00:38:07,473
你怎么找到他的?
How did you find him?

411
00:38:07,800 --> 00:38:10,678
- 我有表现得这么明显吗? - 是你把我调教得太好了

412
00:38:11,440 --> 00:38:13,874
我听说过他 他很棒
I heard about him.He's good.

413

渴望成为行内最出色的
Wants to be the best.

414
00:38:17,840 --> 00:38:19,592

That sound familiar?

415
00:38:20,200 --> 00:38:22,760
我让Eddie暗示他来找你
I told Eddie to point him in your direction.

416
00:38:22,920 --> 00:38:24,876
不管怎么说 我做到了
I'm all but done anyway.

417

- 你打算不管他? - 我们都在努力摆脱
- You going to miss it? - We're all trying to get out.

418
00:38:29,800 --> 00:38:32,951
如果你能做别的 你也想摆脱这种生活 不是嘛
You would,too,if you could think of something else to do.

419
00:38:37,880 --> 00:38:39,199
好啊 伙计们
All right,boys.

420

知道我为什么喜欢轮盘赌?

422

<i>Christopher Rawlings</i>
<i>Christopher Rawlings.</i>

423
00:39:08,160 --> 00:39:09,957

他妻子发现他输了所有的积蓄

你坐过牢 是吧 Danny?

- 想知道A计划吗? - 真让人吃惊
- Want to hear Plan A? - Surprise me.

429
00:39:33,280 --> 00:39:36,989
我们有足够的证据送你们进监狱 没人能躲开法律的制裁
We've already got enough to send everyone down.No way around that.

430
00:39:37,080 --> 00:39:39,753
不过 想想受害者是谁?他的权力.....
But bearing in mind who the mark is,the powers that be...

431
00:39:39,840 --> 00:39:41,558
不会让审判拖太久
would rather not have a lengthy trial.

432
00:39:41,640 --> 00:39:44,598
他会觉得这些内幕太不堪
They think the details might be embarrassing.

433
00:39:45,000 --> 00:39:49,630
他不想被别人知道太多实情 当然 会主动承认犯罪事实
What they need is a watertight case so overwhelming,everyone pleads guilty.

434
00:39:50,000 --> 00:39:53,993
匆匆宣判之后 这件事不久就被人遗忘了
We'll rush the sentencing through and the whole thing blows over.

- Which is? - Just do what you've been doing.

439
00:40:07,080 --> 00:40:10,356
被捕后 我们会给你个藏身处 然后给我们一份证词
After the arrests,we take you to a safe house,you make a statement.

440
00:40:10,440 --> 00:40:12,635
一旦其他人知道 我们取得了确凿的证据
Once the team knows we've got your evidence...

441
00:40:12,720 --> 00:40:15,678
他们知道除了承认有罪 别无他法
they'll know they can't do anything but plead guilty.

442
00:40:15,760 --> 00:40:18,638
作为回报 你将会被无罪释放

如之前所说 和其他人一起进监狱
Like I said,you go down with the rest of them...

445

而且会考虑追加Rawlings一案
and we'll add the Rawlings job for good measure.

446
00:40:28,280 --> 00:40:32,558
你所做的就是回去 假装我们从来没遇到过
All you have to do is go back,pretend we never had this conversation.

447
00:40:32,880 --> 00:40:35,633
不管你做什么 Mickey和其他人 都会进监狱的
Mickey and the others are going to prison whatever you do.

448
00:40:35,720 --> 00:40:40,157
对于你来说 你有选择的机会 是否要跟他们一起进监狱?
The only choice you have to make is whether you go with them or not.

449
00:40:40,240 --> 00:40:41,639
放聪明点 Danny

450
00:40:42,600 --> 00:40:44,352

我以为我们是一起开始的
