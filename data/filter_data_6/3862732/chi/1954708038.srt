1
00:00:02,018 --> 00:00:03,919
这是他们生产的最棒的飞机
It's, like, the best one they make,

2
00:00:03,921 --> 00:00:05,954
- 我就是没法让它飞起来  - 我来想办法
- I just can't get it to work.  - I'll figure it out.

3
00:00:05,956 --> 00:00:09,391
它飞起来的时候 可以把高清视频直接导入你的手机
It streams HD video straight to your phone while it's flying.

4
00:00:09,393 --> 00:00:10,792
真棒
Nice.

5
00:00:10,794 --> 00:00:13,095
我单身的时候 你在哪里?
Where were you when I was single?

6
00:00:15,698 --> 00:00:18,433
好了 再过一个小时就要出发了 行李收拾好了吗?
Okay, we should leave in about an hour. You all packed?

7
00:00:18,435 --> 00:00:20,769
好了 我只需要再放几样东西进去...
Uh, yeah, I just need to throw in a few last minute things...

8
00:00:20,771 --> 00:00:23,071
你懂的 化妆品 内衣和衣服
you know, makeup, underwear, clothes.

9
00:00:23,740 --> 00:00:25,641
如果你可以把浴室地板
If your bathroom floor

10
00:00:25,643 --> 00:00:27,643
打包带上飞机 那你就算收好了
counts as a carry-on, you're packed.

11
00:00:28,578 --> 00:00:30,145
Leonard 你以前做过
Leonard, have you ever given

12
00:00:30,147 --> 00:00:31,680
高中毕业典礼演讲吗?
a high school commencement speech before?

13
00:00:31,682 --> 00:00:33,382
没有 这太令人兴奋了
Nope. It's pretty exciting.

14
00:00:33,384 --> 00:00:35,784
你就不怕被弄瞎吗?
Aren't you afraid of being blinded?

15
00:00:35,786 --> 00:00:37,519
我怎么会被弄瞎?
How would I be blinded?

16
00:00:37,521 --> 00:00:39,187
毕业典礼结束的时候
At the end of the ceremony,

17
00:00:39,189 --> 00:00:41,923
所有学生会把带尖角的帽子抛到空中
all the students throw those pointy hats in the air.

18
00:00:43,059 --> 00:00:44,459
虽然场面好看
It's all pomp and circumstance

19
00:00:44,461 --> 00:00:47,029
迟早有人会被戳瞎的
until someone loses an eye.

20
00:00:47,031 --> 00:00:48,664
我愿意冒险
I'll take my chances.

21
00:00:48,666 --> 00:00:49,865
好吧
Fine.

22
00:00:49,867 --> 00:00:51,133
不知道有没有
I wonder if they make

23
00:00:51,135 --> 00:00:53,368
用盲文做"我早告诉过你"的卡片
"I told you so" cards in braille.

24
00:00:55,104 --> 00:00:56,938
听着 毕业典礼演讲的问题
Look, the problem with commencement speeches

25
00:00:56,940 --> 00:00:58,907
就在于太无聊了
is that they're boring.

26
00:00:58,909 --> 00:01:01,143
你有T恤衫大炮吗?
Ooh, do you own a T-shirt cannon?

27
00:01:01,978 --> 00:01:04,012
他怎么会有T恤衫大炮?
Why would he own a T-shirt cannon?

28
00:01:04,014 --> 00:01:06,114
我不知道 我为什么就有呢?
I don't know. Why do I own one?

29
00:01:07,150 --> 00:01:08,483
我觉得你能和Penny
I think it's really nice

30
00:01:08,485 --> 00:01:10,018
分享这次经历真是太棒了
that you're sharing this experience with Penny.

31
00:01:10,020 --> 00:01:11,520
我觉得带她故地重游
Mm, I thought it'd be fun

32
00:01:11,522 --> 00:01:13,388
一定会很有趣
to show her my old stomping grounds.

33
00:01:13,390 --> 00:01:16,858
我还记得他们欺负我的确切位置
I even know the exact spot where they used to stomp me.

34
00:01:17,660 --> 00:01:19,094
现在你是个成功的科学家
Well, now you get to go back

35
00:01:19,096 --> 00:01:20,462
要荣归母校
as a successful scientist.

36
00:01:20,464 --> 00:01:22,464
还带这个漂亮姑娘
With a beautiful girl on your arm.

37
00:01:22,466 --> 00:01:25,334
还有帽子尖 插在眼球上
And a pointy hat sticking out of your eyeball.

你怎么这么快就准备好了?
How'd you get ready so fast?

50
00:01:56,702 --> 00:01:58,034
我没带多少东西
Oh, I pack light.

51
00:01:58,036 --> 00:01:59,703
有一次 我一件长T恤和一根皮带
Once, I got through an entire spring break

52
00:01:59,705 --> 00:02:01,905
就撑过了整个春假
with nothing but a long T-shirt and a belt.

53
00:02:03,474 --> 00:02:04,841
皮带是拿来做什么的?
Why did you need a belt?

54
00:02:04,843 --> 00:02:07,778
用它来搭配夜生活妆容的
It's called an evening look.

55
00:02:07,780 --> 00:02:09,980
我从没去过新泽西州
I've never been to New Jersey before.

56
00:02:09,982 --> 00:02:11,882
"泽西海岸"和"比弗利娇妻"
It gets a bad rap from shows

57
00:02:11,884 --> 00:02:14,050
这些剧里对新泽西州的评价很差
like Jersey Shore and Real Housewives.

58
00:02:14,052 --> 00:02:15,685
但那都不是真的吧?
So it's not really like that?

59
00:02:15,687 --> 00:02:17,854
不 都是真的
No, it's like that.

60
00:02:18,856 --> 00:02:20,624
我真的很高兴能带你逛逛
Well, I'm excited to show you around.

61
00:02:20,626 --> 00:02:22,726
你觉得我们会有时间去拜访你妈妈吗?
You think we'll have time to visit your mom over there?

62
00:02:22,728 --> 00:02:25,796
有 我们还会有时间用压蒜器把我的旧东西都碾碎了
Yes. We'll also have time to put my junk in a garlic press,

63
00:02:25,798 --> 00:02:28,165
但这两件事 我都不会做
but I'm not doing that either.

64
00:02:30,936 --> 00:02:32,436
糟了
Uh-oh.

65
00:02:32,438 --> 00:02:34,171
我收到了提醒
I just got an alert.

66
00:02:34,173 --> 00:02:35,372
我们的航班被取消了
Our flight's been canceled.

67
00:02:35,374 --> 00:02:36,406
什么?
What?

68
00:02:36,408 --> 00:02:37,841
好像是东海岸那边
Yeah, looks like there's a big storm

69
00:02:37,843 --> 00:02:39,376
遭遇了大风暴
all up the East Coast.

70
00:02:39,378 --> 00:02:41,278
我们能换个航班吗?
Well, can we get on another airline?

71
00:02:41,280 --> 00:02:42,646
我觉得不能
I don't think so.

72
00:02:42,648 --> 00:02:43,947
那就这样了?
So, that's it?

73
00:02:43,949 --> 00:02:44,949
我们不去了?
We're not going?

74
00:02:44,950 --> 00:02:47,217
我觉得去不了了
I guess not. 

75
00:02:47,219 --> 00:02:48,251
太糟糕了
Well, that sucks.

76
00:02:48,253 --> 00:02:49,352
对
Yeah.

77
00:02:49,354 --> 00:02:50,620
我还认真准备了演讲稿
I worked hard on that speech, too.

78
00:02:50,622 --> 00:02:52,823
你可以跟我说一遍
Oh. You could tell it to me.

79
00:02:52,825 --> 00:02:54,458
谢谢 不过我没事
Oh, thank you, but I'm okay.

80
00:02:54,460 --> 00:02:55,859
你确定吗?
Are you sure?

81
00:02:55,861 --> 00:02:57,494
我可以假装自己是个看到优秀校友
I could pretend I'm a high school cheerleader

82
00:02:57,496 --> 00:02:59,830
就把持不住的高中啦啦队队长
who can't control herself around esteemed alumni.

83
00:03:01,866 --> 00:03:03,934
尊敬的啦啦队队员们 你们好
Greetings, distinguished cheerleaders.

84
00:03:03,936 --> 00:03:06,203
哇哦!
Ooh!

85
00:03:07,338 --> 00:03:09,840
好了 无线网中继器已打开 摄像头已打开
Okay, the WiFi extender is on, the camera's on,

86
00:03:09,842 --> 00:03:11,174
它们用的是同一个网络
they're both on the same network;

87
00:03:11,176 --> 00:03:12,509
我们应该能看到影像了
we should be getting an image.

88
00:03:12,511 --> 00:03:14,911
我只看到了黑屏
All I see is a black screen.

89
00:03:14,913 --> 00:03:16,546
还有我的倒影
And my own reflection.

90
00:03:18,015 --> 00:03:19,082
我看上去很伤心
I look sad.

91
00:03:21,252 --> 00:03:22,986
也许我们应该重新校准一下
Maybe we should recalibrate it.

92
00:03:22,988 --> 00:03:24,688
- 好吧  - 第一步:
- All right.  - Step one:

93
00:03:24,690 --> 00:03:26,723
快速将校准开关
rapidly flip the calibration switch

94
00:03:26,725 --> 00:03:28,758
上下最大范围内拨动
from the fully up to the fully down positions

95
00:03:28,760 --> 00:03:30,427
至少十次
for at least ten times.

96
00:03:30,429 --> 00:03:33,330
竟然写了"至少"?
It actually says "at least"?

97
00:03:33,332 --> 00:03:34,965
对
Yeah.

98
00:03:34,967 --> 00:03:36,533
他们干嘛要写"至少"?
Why would they say "at least"?

99
00:03:36,535 --> 00:03:37,968
切换十次?
Is it ten toggles?

100
00:03:37,970 --> 00:03:39,903
还是切换一百次? 你懂吗?
Is it 100 toggles? You know?

101
00:03:39,905 --> 00:03:41,771
还是一千次?
Is it 1,000 toggles?

102
00:03:41,773 --> 00:03:43,573
一万次? 十万次?
10,000 toggles? 100,000 toggles?

103
00:03:43,575 --> 00:03:46,076
Sheldon 别说了!
Sheldon!

104
00:03:46,078 --> 00:03:48,979
你明白我想表达什么意思吧
You see where I'm going with this.

105
00:03:48,981 --> 00:03:51,081
你就拨动开关
Just flip the switch

106
00:03:51,083 --> 00:03:54,217
直到模型机上的灯变成黄色
until the lights on the drone change to solid yellow.

107
00:03:54,219 --> 00:03:56,419
好 那倒是挺简单的
All right, that seems simple enough.

108
00:03:56,421 --> 00:03:59,489
校准程序启动
Initiating calibration sequence.

109
00:03:59,491 --> 00:04:01,558
一 二 三 四
One, two, three, four,

110
00:04:01,560 --> 00:04:05,328
五 六 七 八 九 十 
five, six, seven, eight, nine, ten.

111
00:04:07,865 --> 00:04:11,301
我觉得十次也能算在"至少十次"里吧
Well, I suppose ten is technically "at least ten."

112
00:04:13,204 --> 00:04:16,072
但是他们还是会收到"至少"一封投诉信的
But they're still getting at least one angry letter.

113
00:04:18,209 --> 00:04:20,744
现在我要以它的中轴为中心水平旋转
Now I rotate it horizontally

114
00:04:20,746 --> 00:04:24,781
直到灯变成绿色
on its center axis until the lights turn green.

115
00:04:24,783 --> 00:04:26,950
初始化旋转程序
Initiating rotation sequence.

116
00:04:28,920 --> 00:04:31,922
不要盯着我看 初始化它
Don't look at me, initiate.

117
00:04:34,892 --> 00:04:36,459
哦... 又红又黄是什么意思?
Oh... What does red and yellow mean?

118
00:04:36,461 --> 00:04:38,094
意思是校准失败了
It means the calibration failed.

119
00:04:38,096 --> 00:04:39,529
我们得重来
We have to start over.

120
00:04:39,531 --> 00:04:40,463
嗯 好吧
Oh. Very well.

121
00:04:40,465 --> 00:04:43,567
重启校准程序
Reinitiating calibration sequence.

122
00:04:43,569 --> 00:04:45,302
一 二 三 四
One, two, three, four,

123
00:04:45,304 --> 00:04:48,738
五 六 七 八 九 十...
five, six, seven, eight, nine, ten...

124
00:04:51,108 --> 00:04:53,944
十一
eleven.

125
00:04:55,179 --> 00:04:58,648
还好我没有给他们写投诉信
It's a good thing I didn't send that letter.

126
00:05:04,789 --> 00:05:07,190
嗯 你好 爸爸 什么事?
Mm. Hello, Daddy. What's up?

127
00:05:07,192 --> 00:05:09,626
没什么 就是想看看我儿子最近怎么样
Not much, just wanted to see how my son's doing.

128
00:05:09,628 --> 00:05:11,561
我很好 谢谢
Very well, thank you.

129
00:05:11,563 --> 00:05:13,663
你还在和那个皮肤科医生约会吗?
Are you still dating that dermatologist?

130
00:05:13,665 --> 00:05:16,366
如果你可以感觉到我柔软的皮肤的话
If you could feel how soft my skin is,

131
00:05:16,368 --> 00:05:19,035
你就不会这么问了
you wouldn't have to ask.

132
00:05:19,037 --> 00:05:22,172
这样啊 我还有些别的事要问你
Oh, and there's something else I wanted to ask you.

133
00:05:22,174 --> 00:05:26,409
为什么你把一个月的房租都花在了一个玩具直升机上?
Why did you spend a month's rent on a toy helicopter?!

134
00:05:26,411 --> 00:05:30,180
哦 原来账单寄到你那里了啊
Oh, you're where that bill goes.

135
00:05:30,182 --> 00:05:33,316
我受不了资助你这种愚蠢的生活方式了
I'm tired of indulging your foolish lifestyle.

136
00:05:33,318 --> 00:05:34,884
是时候该让你自己有些责任感了
It's time you learned responsibility.

137
00:05:34,886 --> 00:05:36,453
而唯一的办法就是
And the only way to teach you that

138
00:05:36,455 --> 00:05:37,921
切断我们给你的生活费
is to cut off your allowance.

139
00:05:37,923 --> 00:05:39,723
不要啊 爸爸 别这样!
No, Daddy, no!

140
00:05:39,725 --> 00:05:41,992
还有好多种让我体会责任感的方法呢
There are lots of other ways to teach me responsibility.

141
00:05:41,994 --> 00:05:43,660
我知道 你可以给我一个鸡蛋
I know, you can give me an egg

142
00:05:43,662 --> 00:05:46,363
然后让我把它完好无损地保管一个星期!
and make me take care of it for a week!

143
00:05:46,365 --> 00:05:48,665
我不会的 我已经下定决心了
No, my mind is made up.

144
00:05:48,667 --> 00:05:49,966
从现在开始 你要靠你自己挣钱了
Starting now, you're on your own.

145
00:05:49,968 --> 00:05:53,837
但 爸爸 我 我很想你们啊
But, Daddy, I-I miss my family so much,

146
00:05:53,839 --> 00:05:56,106
你又和妈妈离婚了
and with you and Mummy getting a divorce,

147
00:05:56,108 --> 00:05:57,907
我现在感到又伤心又寂寞
I feel sad and empty.

148
00:05:57,909 --> 00:05:59,476
我买的那个玩具
Buying a little toy

149
00:05:59,478 --> 00:06:02,212
填补了我最近的空虚感
every now and then helps me fill that void.

150
00:06:02,214 --> 00:06:04,447
当我不能每天拥抱你的时候
So while I can't hug you every day,

151
00:06:04,449 --> 00:06:06,116
玩那个直升机时我会...

我要挂断了
I'm cutting you off.

153
00:06:07,285 --> 00:06:11,454
明确一下 你是要断生活费还是断我这句话啊?
Just to be clear, financially or mid-sentence?

154
00:06:14,125 --> 00:06:15,759
没有红和黄
No red and yellow,

155
00:06:15,761 --> 00:06:17,227
没有红和黄

156

00:06:18,997 --> 00:06:20,463
我们成功了!
We did it!

158
00:06:20,465 --> 00:06:21,898
太好了!

天哪 如果光是旋转都这么好玩 想象一下他飞起来的样子吧
God, if it's this much fun to rotate, imagine when we fly it.

160
00:06:26,238 --> 00:06:29,039
好 现在我要做的就是垂直地旋转它
Okay, now all I have to do is rotate it vertically

161
00:06:29,041 --> 00:06:32,275
直到灯灭了
until the lights turn off.

我们把这个宝贝疙瘩拆开吧
Let's open this baby up.

165
00:06:38,950 --> 00:06:41,217
这不会把保修作废吗?
Won't that void the warranty?

166
00:06:41,219 --> 00:06:45,355
Sheldon 我可是有工程硕士学位的人
Sheldon, I have a master's degree in engineering.

167
00:06:45,357 --> 00:06:48,992
保修什么的都是给我擦屁股的
I wipe my bottom with warranties.

168
00:06:50,127 --> 00:06:51,828
除了苹果公司的保修
Except for AppleCare.

169
00:06:51,830 --> 00:06:54,798
这是个一劳永逸的保修
That pays for itself in the long run.

170
00:06:57,068 --> 00:06:58,001
嗨
Hi.

171
00:06:58,003 --> 00:06:59,235

我是要死了吗?
Am I dying? 

176
00:07:07,679 --> 00:07:10,346
快打开它吧
Just open it.

177
00:07:10,348 --> 00:07:11,514
学士服和学士帽?
A cap and gown?

178
00:07:11,516 --> 00:07:13,116
我要这些干嘛?
Why do I need a cap and gown?

179
00:07:13,118 --> 00:07:16,152
因为你要做毕业演讲啊
Because you are giving your commencement speech.

180
00:07:16,154 --> 00:07:17,153
你说什么呢?
What are you talking about?

181
00:07:17,155 --> 00:07:18,521
我给你以前的高中打了电话
I called your old high school

182
00:07:18,523 --> 00:07:21,958
说服他们让你通过Skype来演讲了
and convinced them to let you give your speech over Skype.

183
00:07:21,960 --> 00:07:22,992
真的吗?
Really?

184
00:07:22,994 --> 00:07:23,994
太棒了!
That's amazing!

185
00:07:23,995 --> 00:07:26,096
你还给我买了这个学士服让我开心
And you gave me the robes to give it in.

186
00:07:26,098 --> 00:07:27,297
谢谢你
Thank you.

187
00:07:27,299 --> 00:07:28,231
嗯 其实这些衣服...
Yeah, now about those...

188
00:07:28,233 --> 00:07:29,766
是我从道具店里买来的
uh, they came from a costume shop,

189
00:07:29,768 --> 00:07:32,268
他们剩下的只有性感毕业生系列的了
and all they had left was sexy graduate,

190
00:07:32,270 --> 00:07:33,336
所以...
so they...

191
00:07:33,338 --> 00:07:36,139
衣服可能有些短
might be a little short.

192
00:07:36,141 --> 00:07:39,008
短小性感 这才是我的特长嘛
Short and sexy, that's my wheelhouse.

193
00:07:39,010 --> 00:07:40,810
那必须!
Yeah!

194
00:07:49,420 --> 00:07:52,789
天哪 天哪 好多零件啊
Boy, oh, boy, that's a lot of pieces.

195
00:07:52,791 --> 00:07:54,691
你都知道他们是干什么用的 对吗?
You know what they all do, right?

196
00:07:54,693 --> 00:07:56,860
当然 
Yes, of course.

197
00:07:56,862 --> 00:07:58,128
那这个是干什么用的?
What about this one?

198
00:07:58,130 --> 00:08:00,930
嗯 我... 你对微型集成电路
Well, I... how familiar are you

199
00:08:00,932 --> 00:08:03,366
熟不熟呢?
with miniaturized integrated logic circuits?

200
00:08:03,368 --> 00:08:04,501
并不熟
Not very.

201
00:08:04,503 --> 00:08:05,668
那里不就是个微型

所以说 你能修好它吗?
So, can you get it working?

00:08:12,077 --> 00:08:14,744
我可是麻省理工出来的工程师诶
I'm an MIT-trained engineer.

205
00:08:14,746 --> 00:08:17,147
我还给空间站造零件呢
I've built components for the space station.

206
00:08:17,149 --> 00:08:20,850
我还以为空间站的零重力厕所不怎么好用啊
I thought the zero-gravity toilet didn't work.

207
00:08:20,852 --> 00:08:22,552
它很好用
It worked fine,

208
00:08:22,554 --> 00:08:25,355
只是它们不是为俄罗斯宇航员和
it just wasn't designed for Russian cosmonauts

209
00:08:25,357 --> 00:08:28,024
他们以土豆为主食的饮食习惯设计的

210
00:08:28,026 --> 00:08:29,692
嗨 伙计们

213
00:08:33,098 --> 00:08:36,332
你都做了什么?！
What did you do?!

214
00:08:37,635 --> 00:08:38,701
啊 不要担心
Well, don't worry.

215
00:08:38,703 --> 00:08:40,069
他是麻省理工毕业的
He went to MIT.

216
00:08:40,071 --> 00:08:41,871
只要不是从俄罗斯人直肠里面出来的问题
He can solve any problem,

217
00:08:41,873 --> 00:08:45,308
他都能解决
as long as it doesn't originate in a Russian man's colon.

218
00:08:55,017 --> 00:08:56,617
真不敢相信你这么做!
I don't freaking believe this!

219
00:08:56,619 --> 00:08:57,985
别急 搞得定的
Relax, it'll be fine.

220
00:08:57,987 --> 00:08:59,620
不 你要把它马上组装好
No, you have to put this back together

221
00:08:59,622 --> 00:09:01,455
我好拿去退!
right now, so I can return it!

222
00:09:01,457 --> 00:09:03,124
你退不了
You can't return it.

223
00:09:03,126 --> 00:09:06,127
Howard拿保修卡擦屁股了
Howard wiped his bottom with the warranty.

224
00:09:06,129 --> 00:09:07,962
什么?!
What?!

225
00:09:07,964 --> 00:09:09,697
可能只是个比喻
I think metaphorically.

226
00:09:09,699 --> 00:09:12,133
但他确实在洗手间里待了一会儿
But he was in the bathroom for a while.

227
00:09:14,403 --> 00:09:15,770
Howard 我爸断我生活费了
Howard, my father cut me off.

228
00:09:15,772 --> 00:09:17,438
我得把买这个的钱退回来!
I have to get my money back for this!

229
00:09:17,440 --> 00:09:18,739
别激动
Calm down.

230
00:09:18,741 --> 00:09:19,974
好吧
Okay.

231
00:09:19,976 --> 00:09:21,709
好吧 你说得对
Okay, you're right.

232
00:09:21,711 --> 00:09:23,611
是时候站起来
It's time for me to step up

233
00:09:23,613 --> 00:09:25,580
对自己的生活负责了

00:09:26,515 --> 00:09:27,982
做个男人
Be a man.

235
00:09:30,285 --> 00:09:33,321
喂 老妈
Hello, Mummy.

236
00:09:33,323 --> 00:09:34,689
你好啊 Rajesh
Hello, Rajesh.

237

多么贴心的惊喜啊
What a nice surprise.

238
00:09:36,626 --> 00:09:37,925
我最近挺想你的

239
00:09:37,927 --> 00:09:39,060
你还好吗?
How are you doing?

240
00:09:39,062 --> 00:09:40,661

Are you happy, Mummy?

241
00:09:41,296 --> 00:09:43,297
你这样问候 真是贴心啊
Such a sweet boy for asking.

242
00:09:43,299 --> 00:09:47,368
都不敢相信你是你爸的毒苗
Can't believe you come from the poison seed of your father.

243
00:09:47,370 --> 00:09:49,837
我比较喜欢认为自己是遗传你的
Well, I like to think I take mostly after you.

244
00:09:49,839 --> 00:09:51,272
总之 说到老爸
Anyway, speaking of Daddy,

245
00:09:51,274 --> 00:09:53,608
我之前跟他有段很奇怪的谈话
I had a very strange conversation with him.

246
00:09:53,610 --> 00:09:55,943
他说他没钱给我生活费了
He said he couldn't afford to send me money anymore

247
00:09:55,945 --> 00:09:58,179
因为他的社交太频繁
because of his active social life.

248
00:09:58,181 --> 00:10:02,817
他什么意思 "社交频繁"?
What does that mean, "active social life"?

249
00:10:02,819 --> 00:10:04,185
还是不聊他了
Well, let's not talk about him

250
00:10:04,187 --> 00:10:06,487
管他在耍什么把戏呢
or whatever shenanigans he may or may not be up to.

251
00:10:06,489 --> 00:10:07,588
聊聊你吧
Let's talk about you.

252
00:10:07,590 --> 00:10:10,925
Rajesh 你爸在见别的女人吗?
Rajesh, is your father seeing someone?

253
00:10:10,927 --> 00:10:12,426
老妈 我只知道
All I know, Mummy, is that

00:10:12,428 --> 00:10:15,596
他是个单身阔绰的医生 而现在不知为何
he's a single wealthy doctor, and now, for some reason,

255
00:10:15,598 --> 00:10:18,866
没钱给你的宝贝儿子了
there's no money for your little boy.

256
00:10:20,469 --> 00:10:23,204
不管你爸给你多少钱
Well, however much money your father was giving you,

257
00:10:23,206 --> 00:10:24,338
我都加倍给你
I'll give you more.

258
00:10:24,340 --> 00:10:26,273
多谢啦 老妈 爱你哟!
Thank you, Mummy, I love you!

259
00:10:26,275 --> 00:10:28,442
大伙每人一架直升飞机!
Helicopters for everybody!

260
00:10:30,912 --> 00:10:33,214
为什么这么磨蹭?
What's taking so long?

261
00:10:33,216 --> 00:10:34,682
我觉得这可能行不通
I don't think this is gonna work.

262
00:10:34,684 --> 00:10:36,050
出来让我看看
Just let me see.

263
00:10:41,490 --> 00:10:44,191
亲爱的 你知道毕业礼服里面
Sweetie, you know you're supposed to wear clothes

264
00:10:44,193 --> 00:10:45,860
要穿衣服的吧

265
00:10:45,862 --> 00:10:47,895

嗯
Yeah.

271
00:10:57,507 --> 00:11:00,241
你是视频演讲 他们看不见你的下半身
You're gonna be on Skype; they're not gonna see your legs.

272
00:11:00,243 --> 00:11:02,143
我还是穿上裤子吧 以防万一
Well, I'm gonna go put on some pants just in case.

273
00:11:02,145 --> 00:11:04,879
但我不得不说 这样很自在哦
But I have to say, this is very freeing.

274
00:11:06,683 --> 00:11:10,084
系条腰带 姐带你兜个风

275
00:11:10,086 --> 00:11:11,086
哦

成交 搞定
Done and done.

277
00:11:19,528 --> 00:11:21,996
好了 我大概锁定了故障范围
Okay, I think I've narrowed it down

278
00:11:21,998 --> 00:11:25,032
板载通信芯片上有个小针脚坏了
to a faulty pin on the onboard communication chip.

279
00:11:25,034 --> 00:11:27,668
有一手嘛
Very impressive.

280
00:11:27,670 --> 00:11:29,770
那个 你修完手上的
You know, when you're done with that,

281
00:11:29,772 --> 00:11:32,606
顺便看一眼这个吧?
can you look at this?

282
00:11:33,975 --> 00:11:36,210
这家伙不冒烟了
It doesn't make smoke anymore.

283
00:11:36,212 --> 00:11:38,279
一个一个来
One toy at a time.

啊 或许这样也好吧
Ah, maybe it's for the best.

286
00:11:41,184 --> 00:11:43,217
我听说火车烟尘
I hear locomotive smoke

287
00:11:43,219 --> 00:11:47,321
是火车爱好者的第二大杀手
is the second leading cause of death among train aficionados.

288
00:11:47,323 --> 00:11:48,589
第一大杀手是什么?
What's the first one?

289
00:11:48,591 --> 00:11:50,825
自杀
Suicide.

290
00:11:50,827 --> 00:11:52,259
错

你们大伙不用费这么大劲去修它
You guys don't have to go to the trouble.

295
00:12:01,104 --> 00:12:02,303
老子现在又有钱了
I'm back in the money now;

296
00:12:02,305 --> 00:12:03,604
我可以买架新的直升飞机模型
I can just buy another helicopter.

297
00:12:03,606 --> 00:12:04,872
不是钱的问题
It's not about the money.

298
00:12:04,874 --> 00:12:06,240
而是要如何解决问题
It's about solving a problem.

299
00:12:06,242 --> 00:12:07,808
这也是我立志当工程师的原因
It's why I became an engineer.

300

我喜欢做这个 也在训练自己这方面的能力

302
00:12:12,115 --> 00:12:15,082
看看你... 无所不能的小工程师
Oh, look at you... the little engineer that could.

303
00:12:16,752 --> 00:12:18,619
为什么不打客服求助技术支持?
Why don't you just call tech support?

304
00:12:18,621 --> 00:12:21,388
- 嘿!  - 哇哦  - 别这样!

305
00:12:21,390 --> 00:12:22,556

What?

306
00:12:22,558 --> 00:12:24,125
这世界上有两种人:
There's two kinds of people in this world:

307
00:12:24,127 --> 00:12:25,559
一种是求助客服的人
those who call tech support

308
00:12:25,561 --> 00:12:29,063
另一种是嘲笑第一种人的人
and those who make fun of the people who call tech support.

309
00:12:29,065 --> 00:12:30,698
我向来都是求助客服的
I call tech support all the time.

310
00:12:30,700 --> 00:12:32,066
哈哈! 你居然求助客服!
Ha-ha! You call tech support!

311
00:12:32,068 --> 00:12:33,734
你小学生啊!
What a baby!

312
00:12:34,903 --> 00:12:37,738
现在有请毕业典礼演讲嘉宾
And now, for our commencement address,

313
00:12:37,740 --> 00:12:40,207
我们的杰出校友之一
one of our most distinguished alumni,

314
00:12:40,209 --> 00:12:45,312
著名加州理工物理学家Leonard Hofstadter博士
noted Caltech physicist Dr. Leonard Hofstadter.

315
00:12:48,984 --> 00:12:51,285
尊敬的老师同学们
Members of the faculty, students,

316
00:12:51,287 --> 00:12:54,121
今天 我很高兴能为你们演讲
I'm excited to speak to you today.

317
00:12:54,123 --> 00:12:55,389
我至今还对自己
I can't help but remember

318
00:12:55,391 --> 00:12:57,525
坐在礼堂时的那刻记忆犹新
the last time I was in this auditorium.

319
00:12:57,527 --> 00:12:59,059
两个长曲棍球队的家伙
Two guys from the lacrosse team

320
00:12:59,061 --> 00:13:02,329
把我的哮喘吸入器扔来扔去
played keep-away with my asthma inhaler.

321
00:13:02,331 --> 00:13:05,966
不多说我这十周年同学会了
But enough about my ten-year reunion.

322
00:13:05,968 --> 00:13:08,469
现在我想花上几分钟
I'd also like to take a moment

323
00:13:08,471 --> 00:13:10,437
感谢我美丽的未婚妻
to thank my beautiful fiancée

324
00:13:10,439 --> 00:13:12,039
本来由于天气原因 我无法到场
for to helping make this speech possible,

325
00:13:12,041 --> 00:13:14,008
是她让我今天能有机会做这场演讲
even though weather nearly prevented it.

326
00:13:14,010 --> 00:13:16,477
哦 大家好
Oh. Hello.

327
00:13:16,479 --> 00:13:18,345
我... 我没想到他会把摄像头对着我
I... I didn't know he was gonna point it at me,

328
00:13:18,347 --> 00:13:21,415
那个... 别嗑药 别逃学
so... don't do drugs and stay in school.

329
00:13:21,417 --> 00:13:22,216
他们已经毕业了
They're graduating.

330
00:13:22,218 --> 00:13:23,617
好吧 再见!
Okay, bye!

331
00:13:26,087 --> 00:13:28,355
电路已经连接好了
All right, the power supply is reconnected.

332
00:13:28,357 --> 00:13:29,757
我们差不多搞定了
I think we're back in business.

333
00:13:29,759 --> 00:13:32,493
只要再做几次测试 就可以去室外了
Let's just run a few tests before we take it outside.

334
00:13:32,495 --> 00:13:34,195
- Sheldon 无线网状态?  - 已连接
- Sheldon, we got WiFi?  - Check.

335
00:13:34,197 --> 00:13:35,362
- 全球定位系统?  - 已连接

336
00:13:35,364 --> 00:13:37,064
- 电池电量?  - 已充电
- Battery charged?  - Check.

337
00:13:37,066 --> 00:13:40,501
白白浪费了四个小时? 已浪费
Four hours of our lives gone? Check.

338
00:13:40,503 --> 00:13:41,869
好了
All right.

339
00:13:41,871 --> 00:13:43,037
准备就绪
All systems go.

340
00:13:43,039 --> 00:13:44,039
五...
In five...

341
00:13:44,040 --> 00:13:46,841
四 三 二 一
four, three, two, one.

342
00:13:52,547 --> 00:13:54,582
我的火车以前就是这么喷气的
That's what my train used to do.

343
00:13:57,986 --> 00:14:00,621
准备给售后服务打电话了吗?
Ready to call tech support?

344
00:14:00,623 --> 00:14:03,190
把号码给我吧
Give me the number.

345
00:14:03,192 --> 00:14:04,491
估计结果就是
Probably wind up

346
00:14:04,493 --> 00:14:07,194
某个老外接起电话
talking to some foreign guy

347
00:14:07,196 --> 00:14:11,332
读着我手里的手册
who's reading from the same manual I have.

348
00:14:18,273 --> 00:14:20,274
{\an8}(印度人客服的梗)

349
00:14:18,273 --> 00:14:20,274
是我老爸 你们想多了
It's my father, you jerks.

350
00:14:24,479 --> 00:14:25,679
喂 老爸
Hello, Daddy.

351
00:14:25,681 --> 00:14:26,914
你跟你妈说什么了?
What did you say to your mother?

352
00:14:26,916 --> 00:14:27,916
没说什么啊
Nothing.

353
00:14:27,917 --> 00:14:29,850
就是问问
I was just calling to check in,

354
00:14:29,852 --> 00:14:31,185
她最近怎么样
make sure she's doing okay.

355
00:14:31,187 --> 00:14:32,486
你给她打过电话之后
Well, after talking to you,

356
00:14:32,488 --> 00:14:35,856
她好像觉得我是那种花花公子
she seems to think I'm some sort of playboy.

357
00:14:35,858 --> 00:14:37,191
是嘛?
Really?

358
00:14:37,193 --> 00:14:40,094
我也不知道她怎么会这么想
I don't know where she'd get an idea like that.

359
00:14:40,096 --> 00:14:42,696
你也知道 老妈脑袋里总是有奇奇怪怪的想法
You know Mummy and her crazy imagination.

360
00:14:42,698 --> 00:14:45,966
真高兴我比较像你
I'm so lucky I take after you.

361
00:14:45,968 --> 00:14:49,603
你觉得你像我?
You think you take after me?

362
00:14:49,605 --> 00:14:50,971
我一直试着向你学习
Well, I try to.

363
00:14:50,973 --> 00:14:52,640
要不是把你当做榜样
I certainly wouldn't be a scientist

364
00:14:52,642 --> 00:14:56,477
我一定不会成为科学家的
if you hadn't been my role model.

365
00:14:56,479 --> 00:15:00,347
谁想坐真的直升机去拉斯维加斯玩?!
Who wants to go to Vegas in a real helicopter?!

366
00:15:03,852 --> 00:15:05,886
{\an8}(美国作家 代表作"绿野仙踪")

367
00:15:03,852 --> 00:15:05,886
L. Frank Baum曾说过
It was L. Frank Baum who said,

368
00:15:05,888 --> 00:15:11,025
"无论是多么技术高超的小偷 都无法偷走一个人的知识
"No thief, however skillful, can rob one of knowledge,

369
00:15:11,027 --> 00:15:16,230
所以知识是一个人最宝贵也最安全的财富"
and that is why knowledge is the best and safest treasure."

370
00:15:16,232 --> 00:15:19,433
天啊 我自己都觉得无聊
Wow, I'm boring myself.

371
00:15:21,270 --> 00:15:23,837
不好意思 我现在看不到你们的表情
Sorry, I can't see any of your faces right now,

372
00:15:23,839 --> 00:15:25,739
不过估计都是这样的
but I bet they look like this.

373
00:15:30,211 --> 00:15:34,248
呃 我... 我写了很长的演讲稿
Uh, you know, I... I wrote an entire speech

374
00:15:34,250 --> 00:15:36,617
想告诉你们高中对你们的影响有多大
to say how high school prepares you

375
00:15:36,619 --> 00:15:39,687
还有高中是个多好的地方
and what a wonderful place it is,

376
00:15:39,689 --> 00:15:41,989
可是我讨厌高中
but I hated it.

377
00:15:41,991 --> 00:15:44,591
可能如果你长的这么漂亮的话 应该过的还不错...
Maybe high school's great if you look like this...

378
00:15:46,594 --> 00:15:51,498
不过我都不觉得我在那所学校上过学
but I didn't even feel like I existed at that school.

379
00:15:51,500 --> 00:15:54,101
现在想起来
And now that I think about it,

380
00:15:54,103 --> 00:15:56,670
我敢说你们当中的很多人应该都有这感觉
I bet a lot of you feel the same way.

381
00:15:56,672 --> 00:16:00,207
所以 我后面的演讲
So, for the remainder of my speech,

382
00:16:00,209 --> 00:16:03,510
是说给那些不受关注的孩子们的
this is for the invisible kids.

383
00:16:03,512 --> 00:16:06,814
呃 可能你们从来都格格不入
Uh, maybe you never fit in.

384
00:16:06,816 --> 00:16:09,283
或者你可能是个子最矮的学生
Or maybe you're the smallest kid in the school,

385
00:16:09,285 --> 00:16:11,485
也可能是是最胖的或者最怪的
or the heaviest or the weirdest.

386
00:16:11,487 --> 00:16:12,686
可能你直到毕业
Maybe you're graduating

387
00:16:12,688 --> 00:16:14,955
都还没有经历过初吻
and you still haven't had your first kiss.

388
00:16:14,957 --> 00:16:16,991
对了 十九岁
By the way, 19;

389
00:16:16,993 --> 00:16:20,427
Geraldine Coco 不管你现在在哪里 我都想对你说声谢谢
and Geraldine Coco, wherever you are, thank you.

390
00:16:22,097 --> 00:16:24,198
可能你连一个朋友都没有
Maybe you don't have any friends.

391
00:16:24,200 --> 00:16:27,034
相信我 这都无所谓
And guess what? That's okay.

392
00:16:27,036 --> 00:16:29,303
当那些受欢迎的同学都在...
While all the popular kids are off doing...

393
00:16:29,305 --> 00:16:31,238
管它呢 我从来不知道他们都在干什么
whatever, I don't know what they were doing

394
00:16:31,240 --> 00:16:32,539
因为他们从来不带我玩...
because I was never there...

395
00:16:32,541 --> 00:16:35,075
我... 我一会告诉你
I'll... I'll tell you later.

396
00:16:35,077 --> 00:16:37,911
重点是
My point is,

397
00:16:37,913 --> 00:16:40,014
你独自一人的时候
while you're spending all this time on your own,

398
00:16:40,016 --> 00:16:44,018
可以研究研究电脑或者练练大提琴
building computers or practicing your cello,

399
00:16:44,020 --> 00:16:47,888
你做的事情都会变得有趣起来
what you're really doing is becoming interesting.

400
00:16:47,890 --> 00:16:50,991
而当人们最终注意到你的时候
And when people finally do notice you,

401
00:16:50,993 --> 00:16:54,061
他们会发现 你比他们想象的厉害多了
they're gonna find someone a lot cooler than they thought.

402
00:16:54,063 --> 00:16:56,630
至于那些在高中过的风生水起的学生 我想说
And for those of you who were popular in high school,

403
00:16:56,632 --> 00:16:59,967
很遗憾 高中结束了
it's over, sorry.

404
00:16:59,969 --> 00:17:02,836
感谢大家 并祝贺大家顺利毕业
Thank you and congratulations.

and someone will be with you shortly.

409
00:17:25,326 --> 00:17:27,194
我这是怎么了?
What happened to me?

410
00:17:29,431 --> 00:17:32,266
我什么时候变成一个
When did I become an old man

411
00:17:32,268 --> 00:17:34,835
对高科技无能为力的老头了?
baffled by modern technology?

412
00:17:34,837 --> 00:17:37,004
接下来
Next thing you know,

413
00:17:37,006 --> 00:17:38,972
我就该把裤子提到胸口
I'll be hitching my pants up to my armpits

414
00:17:38,974 --> 00:17:41,008
还不停地抱怨
and complaining about

415
00:17:41,010 --> 00:17:44,044
年轻人爱听的可怕的音乐
the awful music the kids are listening to.

416
00:17:44,046 --> 00:17:47,214
确实挺可怕的吧?
It is awful, isn't it?

417
00:17:47,216 --> 00:17:49,383
这简直是噪音
Listen to that noise.

418
00:17:52,320 --> 00:17:54,221
等下 等下
Hang on, hang on.

419
00:17:54,223 --> 00:17:55,889
它启动了! 我成功了!
It's working! I did it!

420
00:17:55,891 --> 00:17:56,824
你干了什么?
How'd you do that?

421
00:17:56,826 --> 00:17:59,059
不知道 但是我成功了!
No idea, but I did it!

422
00:18:01,429 --> 00:18:03,230
你是不是不应该让它在房间里飞
Maybe you shouldn't be flying it inside.

423
00:18:03,232 --> 00:18:04,298
我没让它飞!
Well, I'm not flying it!

424
00:18:04,300 --> 00:18:05,599
- 那谁在操控它?  - 我不知道!
- Then who is?  - I don't know!

425
00:18:05,601 --> 00:18:08,168
肯定是从别的地方收到了无线网信号!
Must be getting a WiFi signal from somewhere else!

426
00:18:11,940 --> 00:18:13,707
启动降落程序! 启动降落程序!
Initiate landing sequence! Initiate landing sequence!

427
00:18:15,944 --> 00:18:17,578
嘿 摄像机还开着呢!
Hey, the camera's working!

428
00:18:17,580 --> 00:18:18,645
看啊 是我
Oh, look, it's me.

429
00:18:21,880 --> 00:18:22,945
您好 有什么可以帮您的吗?
Tech Support, may I help you?

430
00:18:23,052 --> 00:18:26,587
喂 机器人在攻击我们! 快报警!
Yes, it's a robot uprising! Call the police!

431
00:18:37,467 --> 00:18:39,035
你真觉得他们喜欢我的演讲?
So you really think they liked it?

432
00:18:39,036 --> 00:18:41,503
亲爱的 这是我听过的最...
