我完全不记得他了 直到收到这个

你还在解决保加利亚问题 是吧?
You're not still on that Bulgarian piece, are you?

156
00:10:56,320 --> 00:10:59,650
那个特别繁琐而且累人
It's extremely long-winded and tiresome,

157
00:10:59,740 --> 00:11:02,270
我今晚可要累坏了
and I am fagged out for the night.

158
00:11:03,200 --> 00:11:05,490
你又要加班?
You working late again?

159
00:11:06,620 --> 00:11:08,330
就一点事儿
Just a few things.

160
00:11:08,410 --> 00:11:10,540
你要学会放松 老鬼
You want to slack off a bit, old man.

161
00:11:10,670 --> 00:11:13,080
有野心是好事
Ambition is a fine thing and all that,

162
00:11:13,210 --> 00:11:16,630
但可别冷落了美丽的哈里森小姐
but do not neglect the beautiful Miss Harrison.

163
00:11:16,710 --> 00:11:20,050
其他小伙子会趁虚而入哦
Some other chap might step in.

164
00:11:20,180 --> 00:11:21,470
她不会考虑你的 查尔斯
She wouldn't have you, Charles.

165
00:11:21,550 --> 00:11:22,890
可不是我 老鬼
Well, not me, old man.

166
00:11:22,970 --> 00:11:25,420
我已经有了黛芬妮
I've got my Daphne.

167
00:11:26,220 --> 00:11:27,680
晚安
Goodnight to you.

168
00:11:27,770 --> 00:11:29,770
晚安
Goodnight.

169
00:11:41,110 --> 00:11:44,450
你肯定你工作前他就离开了?
You made sure that he was gone before you started work?

170
00:11:44,570 --> 00:11:47,490
非常确定 而且我尽快抄写了
Quite sure, and I copied as fast as I could,

171
00:11:47,490 --> 00:11:50,000
因为我知道我未婚妻的哥哥约瑟
for I knew that Joseph, my fiancee's brother-

172
00:11:50,080 --> 00:11:52,500
我们在院子里见到他
We met him in the garden.

173
00:11:52,580 --> 00:11:53,290
他在城里
He was in town,

174
00:11:53,420 --> 00:11:56,340
要赶11点的火车返回沃金
and was traveling back to Woking by the 11:00 o'clock train.

175
00:11:56,420 --> 00:11:58,590
可能的话我想赶这趟车
And I wanted to catch it, if possible.

176
00:11:58,710 --> 00:12:01,220
但文件很长?
But it was a long document?

177
00:12:01,340 --> 00:12:03,890
而且用法文写的
Written in French.

178
00:12:08,890 --> 00:12:12,060
9点时 我感觉昏昏欲睡
By 9:00 o'clock, I was feeling drowsy

179
00:12:12,140 --> 00:12:14,980
仅仅完成三分之一
and scarcely a third of the way through.

180
00:12:15,110 --> 00:12:17,320
我想喝杯咖啡也许可以提神
I thought a cup of coffee might clear my brain,

181
00:12:17,440 --> 00:12:20,400
所以我拉铃叫了夜间值班的专员
so I rang the commissioner who stays on duty all night

182
00:12:20,530 --> 00:12:23,670
他在楼梯下面的一间门房里
in a small lodge at the bottom of the stairs.

183
00:12:31,410 --> 00:12:35,730
让我吃惊的是 传到的是个女人
To my surprise, it was a woman who answered the summons.

184
00:12:37,210 --> 00:12:40,880
对不起 我想叫坦盖先生
I'm sorry, I was ringing for Mr. Tangey.

185
00:12:40,960 --> 00:12:42,090
我是他老婆 先生
I'm his wife, sir,

186
00:12:42,220 --> 00:12:44,930
我在这栋楼内做杂务
I do the char work in this building.

187
00:12:45,010 --> 00:12:50,810
啊 我想你能不能给我冲杯咖啡
Ah, well, I was wondering if you might bring me a cup of coffee.

188
00:12:51,930 --> 00:12:53,980
我去问问他 先生
I'll go and ask him, sir.

189
00:12:54,100 --> 00:12:57,110
这个女人
This woman,

190
00:12:57,190 --> 00:12:59,570
你在楼里从没见过吗?
you've never noticed her in the building before?

191
00:12:59,650 --> 00:13:01,530
没有
Never.

192
00:13:01,650 --> 00:13:09,780
咖啡过了很久也没来 所以我下楼去看看
The coffee was some time coming, so I went down to investigate.

193
00:13:09,910 --> 00:13:12,280
大意地离开了房间
Leaving the room unguarded?

194
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:16,000
是的
Yes.

195
00:13:19,000 --> 00:13:23,120
我发现坦盖睡着了
I found Tangey-asleep.

196
00:13:37,690 --> 00:13:42,940
费普先生 非常抱歉 先生
Mr. Phelps, sir, I'm very sorry, sir.

197
00:13:43,030 --> 00:13:46,610
我一定是刚睡着不久
I must have just dropped off for a moment.

198
00:13:46,700 --> 00:13:48,420
你的咖啡 先生
Your coffee, sir.

199
00:13:51,950 --> 00:13:55,460
如果你在这里 先生 那是谁在拉铃?
Well, if you're here, sir, who's ringing the bell?

200
00:13:55,540 --> 00:13:57,460
拉铃 什么拉铃?
Bell, what bell is it?

201
00:13:57,540 --> 00:13:59,380
这个是你办公室的铃声 先生
It's the bell in the room in which you're working, sir.

202
00:14:04,960 --> 00:14:06,470
你跑上楼
You ran back upstairs

203
00:14:06,550 --> 00:14:10,140
文件从你桌上消失了
and the document was gone from your desk.

204
00:14:11,140 --> 00:14:12,810
是的!
Yes!

205
00:14:12,890 --> 00:14:15,890
天啊 不
God no-

206
00:14:19,560 --> 00:14:22,150
你经过时没人在走廊? 
You passed no one in the corridor?

207
00:14:22,230 --> 00:14:24,730
没人 没有人!
No one, there was no one!

208
00:14:24,860 --> 00:14:27,530
房间里 走廊里
And the room and the corridor

209
00:14:27,650 --> 00:14:30,320
一切都是我离开时那样
all seemed exactly as I'd left it!

210
00:14:30,410 --> 00:14:32,530
珀西粗略画了整栋楼的图纸 福尔摩斯先生
Percy has drawn a rough chart of the building, Mr. Holmes,

211
00:14:32,660 --> 00:14:34,040
他认为可能会用到
which he thought might be of use.

212
00:14:34,120 --> 00:14:38,580
是的 没错 那很重要 福尔摩斯先生
Yes, yes, that's of the utmost importance, Mr. Holmes.

213
00:14:41,040 --> 00:14:43,130
是的 我想我很明白了
Yes, I think I quite follow it.

214
00:14:43,250 --> 00:14:46,210
你发现失窃事件后做了什么?
On your discovery of the theft, what did you do then?

215
00:14:46,300 --> 00:14:47,550
我立即察觉到
Well, I recognized in an instant

216
00:14:47,630 --> 00:14:50,490
小偷肯定是从侧门进来的
the thief must have come up through the side door.

217
00:14:51,050 --> 00:14:52,640
在这里
This one here.

218
00:14:52,760 --> 00:14:54,200
是的 那当然 如果他从正门来
Yes, of course. Well, you'd have met him

219
00:14:54,200 --> 00:14:56,140
你会碰到他的
if he'd come the other way.

220
00:14:56,270 --> 00:14:58,520
那你确信他们没躲藏在
And you are satisfied that they could not have been concealed

221
00:14:58,600 --> 00:15:00,400
办公室或走廊里?
in the room or in the corridor?

222
00:15:00,480 --> 00:15:02,230
绝对不可能
Absolutely impossible.

223
00:15:02,360 --> 00:15:03,900
其他门都锁着
All the other doors were locked.

224
00:15:03,980 --> 00:15:06,280
严格的外交部制度
Strict Foreign Office regulations.

225
00:15:07,860 --> 00:15:09,780
根本没什么藏身处
There was no cover at all.

226
00:15:09,900 --> 00:15:13,620
连一只老鼠都无法躲藏
A rat couldn't have concealed himself there.

227
00:15:15,740 --> 00:15:18,410
坦盖和我都跑了出去
Tangey and I both rushed out

228
00:15:18,500 --> 00:15:20,370
奔下通向查尔斯街的楼梯
down the stairs that lead into Charles Street.

229
00:15:20,460 --> 00:15:21,120
费普先生!
Mr. Phelps!

230
00:15:21,250 --> 00:15:24,840
底下的门关着 但没锁
The door at the bottom was closed, unlocked.

231
00:15:24,960 --> 00:15:27,760
当时很黑 下着雨
It was dark, raining.

232
00:15:29,420 --> 00:15:31,390
没有人!
There was no one!

233
00:15:33,140 --> 00:15:38,520
但我清楚地记得当时大笨钟是45分
But I distinctly remember the three-quarters of Big Ben.

234
00:15:38,640 --> 00:15:43,060
9点45分
A quarter to ten.

235
00:15:43,150 --> 00:15:46,110
这个很重要
That is of enormous importance.

236
00:15:46,190 --> 00:15:49,940
他们去到这里 你看 福尔摩斯
They came out here, you see, Holmes.

237
00:15:50,030 --> 00:15:51,360
在街角我们看到巡警
On the corner we found a policeman,

238
00:15:51,360 --> 00:15:52,820
但45分这个时间除了值班员老婆
but he'd seen no one leave the building in the last

239
00:15:52,910 --> 00:15:55,450
他没看到任何人离开大楼
quarter of an hour except for the Commissioner's wife,

240
00:15:55,580 --> 00:15:58,330
我们跑过白厅(伦敦主街道)
so we ran through to Whitehall.

241
00:15:58,450 --> 00:16:03,880
那里车水马龙 人来人往
It was full of traffic, people coming and going,

242
00:16:04,000 --> 00:16:06,700
阴雨之夜 人人都想找到一个
all only too eager to find a place of shelter on

243
00:16:06,700 --> 00:16:08,670
躲雨的地方
so wet a night.

244
00:16:08,800 --> 00:16:11,130
没闲人告诉你有谁经过?
No lounger to tell you who'd passed?

245
00:16:11,220 --> 00:16:12,470
没有
None.

246
00:16:12,550 --> 00:16:15,220
整晚都在下雨吗?
Had it been raining all evening?

247
00:16:15,350 --> 00:16:16,850
从7点开始
Since about 7:00.

248
00:16:16,970 --> 00:16:18,850
啊 这一连串事件
Ah, this chain of events

249
00:16:18,930 --> 00:16:22,600
真是非同寻常地有趣
is certainly of extraordinary interest.

250
00:16:22,690 --> 00:16:25,360
然后你回办公室
And so you returned to the office,

251
00:16:25,480 --> 00:16:27,020
我猜想你检查了一遍
examined it, I presume,

252
00:16:27,150 --> 00:16:30,110
想看入侵者是否留下任何痕迹
to see if the intruder had left any traces;

253
00:16:30,190 --> 00:16:35,070
带泥的脚印 雪茄头 或是落下的手套 发夹?
muddy foot marks, any cigar end,or dropped glove, hairpin?

254
00:16:35,200 --> 00:16:37,370
什么都没有
There was nothing.

255
00:16:37,490 --> 00:16:39,160
但有个明白的事实
Except the tangible fact

256
00:16:39,290 --> 00:16:42,170
值班员的老婆跑出了大楼
that the Commissioner's wife had run out of the building

257
00:16:42,170 --> 00:16:44,690
就在10分钟前
not ten minutes earlier.

258
00:16:45,380 --> 00:16:48,130
下面你做了什么 费普先生?
What did you do next, Mr. Phelps?

259
00:16:48,210 --> 00:16:53,490
巡警通知了苏格兰场(伦敦警视厅)
The constable alerted Scotland Yard.

260
00:16:53,760 --> 00:16:56,470
然后 我才开始
It was then for the first time

261
00:16:56,550 --> 00:17:00,930
对我的处境感到完全的恐惧
the full horror of my situation came upon me.

262
00:17:01,060 --> 00:17:04,560
我一直有信心找回协定
I'd been so confident of regaining the treaty,

263
00:17:04,690 --> 00:17:06,620
我不敢想象...
I dared not think-

264
00:17:08,570 --> 00:17:09,950
华生会告诉你
Watson will tell you

265
00:17:09,950 --> 00:17:13,190
我在学校是个胆怯敏感的男孩
I was a nervous, sensitive boy at school.

266
00:17:13,280 --> 00:17:16,240
这是我的性格
It's my nature.

267
00:17:16,360 --> 00:17:22,000
我想起叔叔 想起他的内阁同僚
I thought of my uncle, his cabinet colleagues,

268
00:17:22,080 --> 00:17:27,480
想到我给他们和自己带来的耻辱
the shame I'd brought upon them, myself,

269
00:17:29,250 --> 00:17:32,800
也给我的亲友带来耻辱
everyone connected with me.

270
00:17:32,920 --> 00:17:36,260
虽然我是意外事件的受害者
Although I was the victim of an accident,

271
00:17:36,340 --> 00:17:41,770
但外交界是不允许有失误的
there are no allowance for accidents in diplomatic circles.

272
00:17:41,890 --> 00:17:44,350
毁灭
Ruined,

273
00:17:44,430 --> 00:17:49,770
耻辱 绝望的毁灭
shamefully, hopelessly ruined!

274
00:17:49,900 --> 00:17:52,480
稳住 老朋友
Steady on, old chap.

275
00:17:58,530 --> 00:18:00,670
退后 福尔摩斯
Stand back, will you, Holmes.

276
00:18:24,100 --> 00:18:25,770
调查结束了吗?
Is the investigation concluded?

277
00:18:25,890 --> 00:18:28,420
再等等
Adjourned.

278
00:18:31,110 --> 00:18:34,400
可怜的老珀西 对一切紧张过度
Poor old Percy, terrible strain, all this,

279
00:18:34,480 --> 00:18:37,070
事业危在旦夕
career in the balance.

280
00:18:37,150 --> 00:18:39,160
这似乎没有影响令妹的爱
It seems not to have affected your sister's devotion.

281
00:18:39,280 --> 00:18:41,120
她认识费普先生多久了?
How long has she known Mr. Phelps?

282
00:18:41,200 --> 00:18:43,910
他们冬天在诺森伯兰郡认识的
Well, they met in Northumberland in the winter.

283
00:18:43,990 --> 00:18:45,790
珀西当时外出忙政府事务
Percy was traveling on government business

284
00:18:45,870 --> 00:18:47,330
在那个地方
in that part of the world.

285
00:18:47,410 --> 00:18:48,670
他俩一见钟情
It was love at first sight.

286
00:18:48,790 --> 00:18:50,790
你家人认为他俩般配吗?
Do your people approve of the match?

287
00:18:50,880 --> 00:18:53,290
当然 福尔摩斯先生
Indeed, Mr. Holmes,

288
00:18:53,380 --> 00:18:55,630
尤其当他们知道珀西
especially when they learned of Percy's connection

289
00:18:55,710 --> 00:18:57,170
与霍德赫斯勋爵的关系后
with Lord Holdhurst.

290
00:18:57,300 --> 00:18:59,180
我父亲是名铁器制造商
My father is an iron-master,

291
00:18:59,260 --> 00:19:02,100
是保守党的坚定支持者
and a staunch supporter of the Conservative Party.

292
00:19:02,180 --> 00:19:03,850
她来这里是为了见珀西的家人
She came down here to meet Percy's people,

293
00:19:03,970 --> 00:19:05,730
而你陪她一同来?      正确
and you came as escort?      That's right.

294
00:19:05,810 --> 00:19:08,060
在他们离开美国前
just before they left for America.

295
00:19:08,180 --> 00:19:12,190
嗯 婚礼安排在九月举行
The, um, the wedding is planned for September,

296
00:19:12,310 --> 00:19:13,970
只要可怜的小伙子恢复健康
if the poor chap recovers.

297
00:19:13,970 --> 00:19:15,530
我想你本打算作个短暂的拜访
I suppose you only intended a short visit,

298
00:19:15,650 --> 00:19:17,110
结果却发生了这种事?
and then came the smash?

299
00:19:17,110 --> 00:19:17,730
嗯
Mm.

300
00:19:22,530 --> 00:19:25,160
请问你的职业是什么?
May I ask you what your occupation is

301
00:19:25,290 --> 00:19:28,830
为何可以整个夏天都呆在沃金?
that allows you to while away the summer in Woking?

302
00:19:28,910 --> 00:19:30,540
福尔摩斯先生 作为长子
As the eldest son, Mr. Holmes,

303
00:19:30,670 --> 00:19:34,000
我的梦想是继承我父亲生意
I have expectations of inheriting my father's business.

304
00:19:34,090 --> 00:19:36,500
我也涉足于股票
I also dabble in stocks and shares,

305
00:19:36,590 --> 00:19:40,010
因此我有一定的经济独立
which grants me a certain independence.

306
00:19:40,090 --> 00:19:43,510
恕我无礼 如果我的问题得罪了你
My apologies if my question offended you.

307
00:19:44,970 --> 00:19:46,180
5月23日晚上
On the night of May the 23rd,

308
00:19:46,310 --> 00:19:49,640
你约了费普先生在滑铁卢车站见面
had you arranged to meet Mr. Phelps at Waterloo

309
00:19:49,730 --> 00:19:51,390
并一同赶11点的火车吗?
to take the 11:00 o'clock train together?

310
00:19:51,520 --> 00:19:53,020
没有
No.

311
00:19:53,100 --> 00:19:54,560
那是他的打算
That may have been his intention,

312
00:19:54,690 --> 00:19:57,280
他知道我在伦敦跟股票经纪人吃饭
he knew I was in London dining with my stockbroker.

313
00:19:57,400 --> 00:20:00,450
但是我没预计跟他见面
But I wasn't expecting to meet him.

314
00:20:00,570 --> 00:20:02,780
那么谢谢你宝贵的时间 哈里森先生
Then thank you for your time, Mr. Harrison.

315
00:20:02,910 --> 00:20:09,370
我该... 嗯 你能否... 那是病房
Shall I, um, and would you, the sick room.

316
00:20:15,920 --> 00:20:18,000
福尔摩斯先生 真不好意思
Mr. Holmes, I do apologize.

317
00:20:18,090 --> 00:20:22,110
我现在平静多了 多亏了华生的护理
I feel calmer now, thanks to Watson's ministration.

318
00:20:23,430 --> 00:20:24,800
对他温和些 福尔摩斯
Gently with him, Holmes.

319
00:20:24,930 --> 00:20:26,110
啊
Ah.

320
00:20:27,140 --> 00:20:29,220
费普先生
Mr. Phelps,

321
00:20:29,310 --> 00:20:32,270
还有值班员老婆的事
there is just the matter of the Commissioner's wife.

322
00:20:32,390 --> 00:20:33,900
是 当然
Yes, of course.

323
00:20:33,980 --> 00:20:37,820
我记得 我们回办公室后不久
As I remember, shortly after our return to my office,

324
00:20:37,940 --> 00:20:39,990
苏格兰场探员福布斯抵达
Inspector Forbes of the Yard arrived

325
00:20:39,990 --> 00:20:43,110
精神抖擞地接过案子
to take up the case with considerable energy.

326
00:20:43,240 --> 00:20:45,410
我们租了马车 在半个小时内
We hired a hansom, and within half an hour

327
00:20:45,530 --> 00:20:47,830
到了坦盖夫妇位于布莱顿的家
we were at the Tangeys' home in Brixton.

328
00:20:47,950 --> 00:20:51,910
他的大女儿开的门
The door was opened by his eldest daughter.

329
00:20:52,040 --> 00:20:52,960
嘿 你想干嘛?
Hey, what do you want?

330
00:20:53,040 --> 00:20:54,080
你妈妈在家吗?
Is your mother at home?

331
00:20:54,210 --> 00:20:55,290
还没回来
Not yet.

332
00:20:55,420 --> 00:20:57,290
她做晚班的清理活儿
She does a night job - cleaning.

333
00:20:57,420 --> 00:20:59,340
你不介意的话我们在这儿
We'll wait for her, if you don't mind.

334
00:20:59,460 --> 00:21:00,920
等她回来
In here.

335
00:21:02,470 --> 00:21:05,750
你回房 快点 把门关上
And you get back in here, now go on, and shut the door.

336
00:21:09,310 --> 00:21:13,140
大约十分钟后 我们听到前门有动静
After about ten minutes, we heard the front door,

337
00:21:13,230 --> 00:21:15,270
这时我们犯了个严重的错误
and here we made one serious mistake

338
00:21:15,400 --> 00:21:18,250
都怪我不好
for which I blame myself.

339
00:21:20,440 --> 00:21:23,280
妈妈 有两个人在客厅想跟你说话
Mum, there's two men in the parlor wants to talk to ya'.

340
00:21:23,360 --> 00:21:25,950
天啊!
Oh, my God!

341
00:21:34,210 --> 00:21:35,870
这不是办公楼里的费普先生吗?
If it isn't Mr. Phelps of the office.

342
00:21:36,000 --> 00:21:37,040
过来 过来 你以为我们会是谁
Come, come, who did you think we were

343
00:21:37,170 --> 00:21:38,210
让你想逃跑?
when you ran away from us?

344
00:21:38,340 --> 00:21:39,960
我以为你们是执行官
I thought you was the bailiffs.

345
00:21:40,090 --> 00:21:42,010
我们跟个零售商有纠葛
We've had some trouble with a tradesman.

346
00:21:42,090 --> 00:21:46,050
放手 放手 放...
Here, let go, let go, let-

347
00:21:48,010 --> 00:21:49,290
我们有理由相信
We've reason to believe that you've taken

348
00:21:49,290 --> 00:21:51,640
你从外交部拿了份很重要的文件
a paper of importance from the Foreign Office,

349
00:21:51,970 --> 00:21:54,180
你跑到这想销毁文件
and you ran in here to dispose of it.

350
00:21:54,310 --> 00:21:55,870
你最好跟我们去一趟
Now, you better come back with us

351
00:21:55,870 --> 00:21:57,970
苏格兰场接受搜身      把手放开
to Scotland Yard to be searched.        Get your hands off me!

352
00:21:57,970 --> 00:22:00,570
我没有拿文件!      够了...    
I didn't take no paper!         That will be enough-

353
00:22:00,690 --> 00:22:02,480
安静下来 
There will be peace and quiet.

354
00:22:02,610 --> 00:22:07,550
费普先生...      不要 别!
Mr. Phelps...         no, stop it!

355
00:22:26,050 --> 00:22:28,890
你把厨房搜遍了?
You made a full examination of the kitchen?

356
00:22:28,970 --> 00:22:30,470
是的
Yes.

357
00:22:30,550 --> 00:22:33,720
一点文件的踪迹都没有
There was no sign of the documents.

358
00:22:35,560 --> 00:22:37,060
一架四轮马车来了
A four-wheeler was brought

359
00:22:37,060 --> 00:22:40,360
我们三个一起到了苏格兰场
and we all three drove back in it to Scotland Yard.

360
00:22:40,440 --> 00:22:43,070
我在万分焦急中等待
I waited in an agony of suspense

361
00:22:43,190 --> 00:22:46,070
直到女警察出来报告
until the female searcher came back with her report.

362
00:22:46,190 --> 00:22:47,700
她们什么也没搜到
They found nothing.

363
00:22:47,820 --> 00:22:51,120
之后的事我不太记得了
After that, I have no clear recollection.

364
00:22:51,240 --> 00:22:54,740
我想是位警官送我到滑铁卢
I believe a police officer drove me to Waterloo

365
00:22:54,870 --> 00:22:56,750
稍微走运的是
where by the merest good fortune,

366
00:22:56,830 --> 00:22:59,080
我在那遇到住我附近的费里尔医生
I met Dr. Ferrier, who lives near us

367
00:22:59,210 --> 00:23:01,960
准备乘下一趟火车
and was traveling down by the next train.

368
00:23:02,090 --> 00:23:04,000
你赶上的火车是?
The train you caught now would have been?

369
00:23:04,090 --> 00:23:07,260
11点40分那趟 我想
The 11:40, I think.

370
00:23:07,380 --> 00:23:10,890
费里尔医生我对照顾周到
Dr. Ferrier most kindly took charge of me.

371
00:23:10,970 --> 00:23:12,660
多亏他照顾得好
Just as well he did,

372
00:23:12,660 --> 00:23:13,930
因为我在车站里昏厥过一次
for I had a fit in the station.

373
00:23:14,010 --> 00:23:17,750
在到家之前我几乎成了个语无伦次的疯子
and before we reached home I was practically a raving lunatic.

374
00:23:18,940 --> 00:23:21,060
令兄那时已经回来了吗?
Your brother had already returned?

375
00:23:21,150 --> 00:23:22,520
是的
Yes.

376
00:23:22,610 --> 00:23:26,570
我虽感奇怪 但没有为他独自回来而担忧
I was surprised, but not unduly worried that he was alone.

377
00:23:26,650 --> 00:23:30,450
珀西经常加班 我知道还有另一趟火车
Percy often worked late, and I knew there was another train.

378
00:23:30,570 --> 00:23:33,070
所以我先睡了
So I went to bed.

379
00:23:33,160 --> 00:23:36,080
然后午夜某时?
And sometime after midnight?

380
00:23:36,160 --> 00:23:39,960
我被大厅内可怕的骚动惊醒
I was woken by the most fearful commotion in the hall.

381
00:23:40,080 --> 00:23:44,130
把他带到这 把他带到这!
Bring him in here, bring him in here!

382
00:23:44,250 --> 00:23:46,920
天啊...
Oh, God...

383
00:23:48,550 --> 00:23:51,340
你哥哥当时是在楼下这间房睡觉的?
Your brother was sleeping down here in this room?

384
00:23:51,470 --> 00:23:52,180
是的
Yes.

385
00:23:52,300 --> 00:23:54,800
我家人趁正在美国旅行
My family were taking advantage of their trip to America

386
00:23:54,930 --> 00:23:57,310
让人翻修楼上几间卧室
to have several of the upstairs bedrooms redecorated.

387
00:23:57,390 --> 00:24:00,310
很明显 可怜的珀西病了很久
It was evident that poor Percy was in for a long illness.

388
00:24:00,390 --> 00:24:02,770
所以约瑟搬进我的房间
So, Joseph was bundled up to my room,

389
00:24:02,850 --> 00:24:09,240
这儿变成了我的病房
and this was turned into a sick room for me.

390
00:24:16,030 --> 00:24:18,300
这是个令人愉快的房间 
Why, it's a very cheery room.

391
00:24:20,910 --> 00:24:24,170
我在这里已经神志不清地躺了九周 
I have lain here for nine weeks, delirious.

392
00:24:24,290 --> 00:24:27,050
如果不是哈里森小姐和医生的照顾
If it had not been for Miss Harrison and the doctor's care,

393
00:24:27,170 --> 00:24:30,260
我现在不可能跟你们说话
I should not be speaking to you now.

394
00:24:30,340 --> 00:24:32,550
她白天护理我
She nursed me by day,

395
00:24:32,680 --> 00:24:36,100
雇佣的护士晚上看我
a hired nurse looked after me at night,

396
00:24:36,220 --> 00:24:39,970
神经病发作时我什么都做不了
for in the mad fits I was capable of anything.

397
00:24:40,060 --> 00:24:41,140
只是数天前
It's only in the last few days

398
00:24:41,270 --> 00:24:44,000
我的神志才慢慢清醒
that my reason has slowly cleared.

399
00:24:46,230 --> 00:24:48,360
我发电报跟福布斯探员联系过
I've wired Inspector Forbes,

400
00:24:48,480 --> 00:24:51,860
但他告诉我 没发现任何线索
but he's told me no clue has been discovered.

401
00:24:51,950 --> 00:24:57,200
所以我找了你 福尔摩斯先生 我最后的希望
So I turn to you, Mr. Holmes, as my last hope.

402
00:24:59,370 --> 00:25:02,370
问一个很重要的问题 费普先生
Just one question of the utmost importance, Mr. Phelps.

403
00:25:02,500 --> 00:25:06,420
你有告诉任何人这个特别任务吗?
Did you tell anyone that you had this special task to perform?

404
00:25:06,540 --> 00:25:07,500
没有
No one.

405
00:25:07,630 --> 00:25:10,050
比如说 哈里森小姐呢?
Not Miss Harrison, for example?

406
00:25:10,130 --> 00:25:11,760
没有
No.

407
00:25:11,880 --> 00:25:13,800
在接到命令和
I had not been back to Woking

408
00:25:13,880 --> 00:25:18,060
执行任务的时间内 我没回过沃金
in between getting the order and executing the commission.

409
00:25:23,270 --> 00:25:28,110
玫瑰是多么可爱的东西呀
What a lovely thing a rose is.

410
00:25:28,230 --> 00:25:29,300
没有什么
There is nothing in which

411
00:25:29,300 --> 00:25:35,860
比宗教更需要推理法
deduction is so necessary as in religion.

412
00:25:35,990 --> 00:25:40,240
推理学者建立出一门精密的学科
It can be built up as an exact science by the reasoner.

413
00:25:40,370 --> 00:25:43,200
我们对上帝仁慈的最高信仰
Our highest assurance of the goodness of Providence

414
00:25:43,290 --> 00:25:46,250
在我看来 尽寄托于鲜花中
seems to me to rest in the flowers.

415
00:25:46,370 --> 00:25:49,790
它额外给予的仁慈
It is only goodness which gives extras,

416
00:25:49,920 --> 00:25:52,460
所以我再说一遍
and so I say again,

417
00:25:52,590 --> 00:25:59,050
我们从花中可得到巨大的希望
we have much to hope for from the flowers.

418
00:26:03,220 --> 00:26:04,310
那你看到解开
Do you see any prospect

419
00:26:04,430 --> 00:26:08,920
这个疑团的希望了吗 福尔摩斯先生?
of solving this mystery, Mr. Holmes?

420
00:26:11,230 --> 00:26:13,110
疑团?
Mystery?

421
00:26:13,190 --> 00:26:17,740
啊 否认这案子难解
Ah, it would be absurd to deny

422
00:26:17,860 --> 00:26:20,410
又复杂的话 那就是愚蠢了
that the case is abstruse and complicated.

423
00:26:20,490 --> 00:26:22,080
你看出什么线索了吗?
Do you see any clue?

424
00:26:22,160 --> 00:26:23,240
你们已经提供了7个线索
You have furnished me with seven,

425
00:26:23,330 --> 00:26:24,870
但是我必须先检验一番
but I must put them to the test

426
00:26:24,950 --> 00:26:27,580
才能判断线索的价值
before I can pronounce on their value.

427
00:26:27,710 --> 00:26:29,170
你怀疑了某人?
You suspect someone?

428
00:26:29,290 --> 00:26:30,800
我怀疑...
I suspect...

429
00:26:32,920 --> 00:26:34,010
我自己
myself.

430
00:26:34,130 --> 00:26:35,260
什么?
What?

431
00:26:35,340 --> 00:26:38,340
是不是过快下结论
Of coming to conclusions too rapidly.

432
00:26:38,970 --> 00:26:45,310
那回伦敦检验你的推论吧!
Then go back to London and test your conclusions!

433
00:26:45,430 --> 00:26:50,270
你的建议很好 哈里森小姐
Your advice is very excellent, Miss Harrison.

434
00:26:54,900 --> 00:26:59,110
费普先生 不要期望太高
Mr. Phelps, do not indulge yourself in false hopes,

435
00:26:59,240 --> 00:27:01,660
此事非常扑朔迷离
the affair is a very tangled one,

436
00:27:01,740 --> 00:27:05,950
而我不是魔术师
and I am not a magician.

437
00:27:09,460 --> 00:27:13,430
嘿 小淘气鬼!
Hey, little varmint!

438
00:27:14,250 --> 00:27:16,510
你怎么看哈里森小姐?
What do you think of Miss Harrison?

439
00:27:16,630 --> 00:27:19,510
还不错 要么我看错了
A good sort, or I'm mistaken.

440
00:27:19,630 --> 00:27:21,470
我觉得你对她直接了些
I thought you were rather terse with her.

441
00:27:21,550 --> 00:27:22,970
是吗?
Was I?

442
00:27:23,050 --> 00:27:24,810
她只是在保护爱人
She was only protecting her loved one.

443
00:27:24,930 --> 00:27:27,770
也许保护过头了点
A little overprotective, perhaps.

444
00:27:27,850 --> 00:27:28,990
当然 你不会以为
Surely, you don't believe

445
00:27:28,990 --> 00:27:31,980
她与此事有关吧?
that she had anything to do with it?

446
00:27:32,060 --> 00:27:34,860
华生 最难侦查的犯罪
The most difficult crime to track down, Watson,

447
00:27:34,980 --> 00:27:36,490
就是毫无目的的犯罪
is the one which is purposeless.

448
00:27:36,490 --> 00:27:38,740
而这个并非毫无目的
Now, this is not purposeless,

449
00:27:38,860 --> 00:27:41,490
那么谁是此事的受益人?
but who is it that profits by it?

450
00:27:41,610 --> 00:27:44,490
法国大使 俄国大使
Well, there's the French Ambassador, the Russian,

451
00:27:44,580 --> 00:27:46,540
把协定卖给其中一位大使的人
and whoever might sell it to either of those.

452
00:27:46,660 --> 00:27:49,370
还有霍德赫斯勋爵 
And Lord Holdhurst.

453
00:27:49,500 --> 00:27:50,790
这不是不可能
While it is not inconceivable

454
00:27:50,870 --> 00:27:53,040
一个政治家处于如此地位
that a statesman might find himself in a position

455
00:27:53,170 --> 00:27:54,590
就不会后悔
where he was not sorry

456
00:27:54,710 --> 00:27:57,670
能趁机毁掉这么一份文件
to see such a document accidentally destroyed.

457
00:27:57,760 --> 00:27:58,590
但拥有光荣记录
Not a statesman

458
00:27:58,720 --> 00:28:01,800
的霍德赫斯勋爵不是这样的政治家
with the honorable record of Lord Holdhurst.

459
00:28:01,890 --> 00:28:07,220
乔治 去外交部
George, the Foreign Office,

460
00:28:07,350 --> 00:28:10,560
查尔斯街入口
Charles Street entrance.

461
00:28:10,690 --> 00:28:12,690
乔治 我想你为我做点事
George, I want you to do something for me.

462
00:28:12,810 --> 00:28:14,980
找一架曾在那儿下车的马车
Find the cab which dropped a fare there

463
00:28:15,070 --> 00:28:19,900
时间是5月23日晚刚过9点半
just after half past 9:00 on the evening of May the 23rd.

464
00:28:24,240 --> 00:28:28,160
戈罗 法国名字
Gorot, a French name.

465
00:28:28,240 --> 00:28:29,910
实际是胡格诺教徒
Huguenot, actually.

466
00:28:30,040 --> 00:28:33,540
但我跟你一样是英国人 福尔摩斯先生
But I'm as English in sympathy as you are, Mr. Holmes.

467
00:28:33,970 --> 00:28:37,340
我是否因为姓名而遭怀疑?
Am I under some sort of cloud because of my name?

468
00:28:38,020 --> 00:28:40,380
哦 不 不 福尔摩斯也有个法国奶奶
Oh, no, no, Holmes has a French grandmother.

469
00:28:45,050 --> 00:28:46,740
我可以让你躲开
I'd make yourself scarce

470
00:28:46,740 --> 00:28:48,230
福布斯探员的调查 如果你想的话
 if you want to avoid Inspector Forbes.

471
00:28:48,230 --> 00:28:50,560
我们安排了他5分钟后于此见面
We've arranged to meet him here in five minutes.

472
00:28:50,640 --> 00:28:56,690
是的 我已经被他讯问过
Yes, I have been questioned by him already.

473
00:28:56,770 --> 00:29:00,490
我会照你们说的做
I shall do as you say.

474
00:29:00,610 --> 00:29:01,700
两位 晚安
Goodnight to you both.

475
00:29:01,780 --> 00:29:04,450
晚安
Goodnight.

476
00:29:04,570 --> 00:29:05,950
没有暗门
No secret doors,

477
00:29:06,030 --> 00:29:08,490
窗户距地面30英尺
the windows quite 30 feet above the ground,

478
00:29:08,620 --> 00:29:11,450
从里面插上插销
fastened on the inner side.

479
00:29:16,960 --> 00:29:21,970
地毯使地板门的可能性为零
The carpet prevents any possibility of a trap door.

480
00:29:22,090 --> 00:29:23,880
无论是谁拉铃绳
Now, whoever rang the bell rope

481
00:29:23,970 --> 00:29:27,890
都必须来到这个桌子前面
must have come right over to the desk.

482
00:29:27,970 --> 00:29:32,270
为什么拉铃呢?
Why ring it?

483
00:29:32,390 --> 00:29:36,560
这个小偷想虚张声势?
I mean, was it the thief, out of bravado?

484
00:29:36,650 --> 00:29:38,490
或是有谁跟小偷一块儿
Or was it someone with the thief

485
00:29:38,690 --> 00:29:40,890
他想阻止这个罪行?
who tried to prevent the crime?

486
00:29:45,990 --> 00:29:48,950
要么就...
Or was it-

487
00:29:54,500 --> 00:29:57,420
是福布斯探员 对吗?
Inspector Forbes, I believe.

488
00:29:57,500 --> 00:30:01,130
福尔摩斯先生 我是个大忙人
Mr. Holmes, I'm a very busy man.

489
00:30:01,250 --> 00:30:03,470
除了这个我还有别的案件
I have other cases besides this one.

490
00:30:03,550 --> 00:30:07,850
但我打赌没什么比国家利益更重要
But none so vital to the national interest, I'll wager.

491
00:30:08,470 --> 00:30:12,270
我来介绍一下我的朋友兼同事 华生医生
May I introduce my friend and colleague, Dr. Watson?

492
00:30:15,520 --> 00:30:17,810
你想从我这知道什么 福尔摩斯?
What do you want from me, Holmes?

493
00:30:17,940 --> 00:30:20,020
我知道你的那一套
I know about your methods.

494
00:30:20,150 --> 00:30:22,320
你准备用我们的情报
You're ready enough to use our information,

495
00:30:22,400 --> 00:30:24,150
自己设法去结案
then you try and finish the case yourself

496
00:30:24,280 --> 00:30:25,990
然后让我们丢人现眼
and bring discredit on us.

497
00:30:26,070 --> 00:30:29,160
正相反 在我破获的53件案子里
On the contrary, in my last 53 cases,

498
00:30:29,280 --> 00:30:31,530
只有4件提到我的名字
my name has appeared in only 4

499
00:30:31,660 --> 00:30:38,330
其他49件功劳全归警方
and the police have the credit in 49.

500
00:30:38,420 --> 00:30:40,380
我不责怪你不知道这个
I don't blame you for not knowing this,

501
00:30:40,500 --> 00:30:43,880
你年轻 缺乏经验
you are young and inexperienced.

502
00:30:44,010 --> 00:30:46,010
但如果你想在工作上出人头地
But if you wish to get on in your duties

503
00:30:46,090 --> 00:30:48,590
你得跟我合作 而不是对着干
you will work with me and not against me!

504
00:30:48,720 --> 00:30:51,930
那你采取过什么措施?
Now, then, what steps have you taken?

505
00:30:52,060 --> 00:30:54,810
坦盖 那个值班员 我们查过了
Tangey, the commissioner, we've cleared.

506
00:30:54,890 --> 00:30:57,560
他离开警卫队时名声很好
He left the Guards with a good character.

507
00:30:57,690 --> 00:31:01,110
但他老婆不是好东西 酗酒
His wife is a bad lot, though, she drinks.

508
00:31:01,230 --> 00:31:04,690
那个职员戈罗呢?
What about the clerk, Gorot?

509
00:31:04,820 --> 00:31:06,950
我们已经跟踪他九周了
He's been shadowed all these nine weeks.

510
00:31:07,070 --> 00:31:08,820
还是找不到任何线索
We can show nothing against him.

511
00:31:08,910 --> 00:31:13,080
你对铃为什么会响有何看法?
Have you formed any theory about how this bell rang?

512
00:31:13,200 --> 00:31:14,120
没有
No.

513
00:31:14,240 --> 00:31:16,540
我得承认 我被难倒了
I must confess, that beats me.

514
00:31:16,620 --> 00:31:18,580
不管是谁干的 那人都很厚颜无耻
It was a cool hand, whoever it was,

515
00:31:18,710 --> 00:31:19,920
来了还发警报
to go and give the alarm like that.

516
00:31:20,040 --> 00:31:22,790
对 是件很奇怪的事情
Yes, yes, it was a very queer thing to do.

517
00:31:22,920 --> 00:31:24,090
好的 非常感谢 探员
Well, many thanks, Inspector,

518
00:31:24,210 --> 00:31:26,050
如果我要你去抓那个贼
and if I can put this thief in your hands,

519
00:31:26,130 --> 00:31:27,380
我会通知你的
you shall hear from me.

520
00:31:27,510 --> 00:31:30,510
走吧 华生
Come along, Watson.

521
00:31:30,590 --> 00:31:34,680
能问一下你们现在去哪里?
May I ask where you're going now?

522
00:31:34,760 --> 00:31:39,140
跟内阁大臣霍德赫斯勋爵会面
To interview Lord Holdhurst, the Cabinet Minister

523
00:31:39,270 --> 00:31:42,690
他很可能是下一届英格兰首相
and very possibly the next Premier of England.

524
00:31:42,810 --> 00:31:45,780
晚安 探员 
Good evening, Inspector.

525
00:31:47,030 --> 00:31:48,460
福尔摩斯先生
I can't pretend, Mr. Holmes,

526
00:31:48,460 --> 00:31:51,490
我不能装作不知你的来意
that I am ignorant of the reason for your visit,

527
00:31:51,610 --> 00:31:54,120
但能否问下你是在为谁效力?
but in whose interests are you acting, may I ask?

528
00:31:54,240 --> 00:31:56,080
受珀西・费普先生所托
In the part of Mr. Percy Phelps.

529
00:31:56,160 --> 00:31:58,660
啊 我不幸的侄子
Ah, my unfortunate nephew.

530
00:31:58,790 --> 00:32:00,420
你知道我们的血缘关系
You can understand that our kinship

531
00:32:00,540 --> 00:32:05,000
无论如何都让我无法包庇他
makes it the more impossible for me to screen him in any way.

532
00:32:05,130 --> 00:32:09,010
但如果文件找到了呢 霍德赫斯勋爵?
Yes, but if the document is found, Lord Holdhurst?

533
00:32:09,130 --> 00:32:15,260
那当然另当别论
That, of course, would be different.

534
00:32:17,180 --> 00:32:18,850
霍德赫斯勋爵 您是在
Lord Holdhurst, it was in this room

535
00:32:18,980 --> 00:32:23,900
这间办公室吩咐抄写文件的吗?
that you gave instructions for the copying of the document?

536
00:32:23,980 --> 00:32:26,570
是的
It was.

537
00:32:26,650 --> 00:32:28,860
除了贵侄子外您没有对外人提起过
And you mentioned it to nobody else except your nephew,

538
00:32:28,990 --> 00:32:30,610
您确定吗?
you're certain of that?

539
00:32:30,740 --> 00:32:32,660
很确定
Absolutely.

540
00:32:32,740 --> 00:32:34,950
那么如果别人不知道
Then if nobody else knew of it,

541
00:32:35,080 --> 00:32:39,660
您承认小偷出现在你侄子办公室
you would agree that the thief's presence in your nephew's room

542
00:32:39,790 --> 00:32:40,710
纯属偶然了
was purely accidental.

543
00:32:40,830 --> 00:32:44,130
那他是顺手拿走文件的
I mean, he saw his chance and took it.

544
00:32:45,670 --> 00:32:51,380
你说的超出我能力范围 福尔摩斯先生
You take me out of my province there, Mr. Holmes.

545
00:32:52,260 --> 00:32:57,430
还有重要的一点...
There is one other very important point.

546
00:32:57,510 --> 00:32:59,810
您很担心 而我认为
You feared, so I understand,

547
00:32:59,890 --> 00:33:01,390
如果协定的细节
that very grave results

548
00:33:01,520 --> 00:33:06,770
一经外泄 其后果极为严重
might follow from the details of this treaty becoming known?

549
00:33:06,860 --> 00:33:10,490
的确是很严重的后果
Very grave results indeed.

550
00:33:10,610 --> 00:33:13,110
后果产生了吗?
Have they occurred?

551
00:33:13,200 --> 00:33:14,950
还没有
Not yet.

552
00:33:15,030 --> 00:33:17,080
我们假设 如果此协定已经落入
If the treaty had reached, let us say,

553
00:33:17,200 --> 00:33:19,910
俄国或法国外交部手中
the Russian or the French Foreign Office,

554
00:33:20,040 --> 00:33:22,290
你认为你收得到风声吗?
you would expect to hear of it?

555
00:33:22,370 --> 00:33:24,290
我当然可以
I certainly should. 

556
00:33:24,370 --> 00:33:27,380
既然将近十周过去了
Then since nearly ten weeks have elapsed,

557
00:33:27,500 --> 00:33:29,800
那有正当理由假设
it is not unfair to suppose then

558
00:33:29,880 --> 00:33:34,720
由于某种原因协定还没落入他们之手
that the treaty for some reason has not reached them.

559
00:33:36,090 --> 00:33:37,260
可是福尔摩斯 我们很难假设
But Holmes, we can hardly suppose

560
00:33:37,390 --> 00:33:40,680
小偷盗协定是为了...
that the thief took the treaty in order to...

561
00:33:40,810 --> 00:33:45,520
裱起来挂在墙上
frame it and hang it on his wall.

562
00:33:45,600 --> 00:33:52,320
也许他在等更高的价钱 华生
Well, perhaps he's waiting for a better price, Watson.

563
00:33:52,400 --> 00:33:56,660
或是他突然病了
Or maybe he's had a sudden illness.

564
00:33:56,740 --> 00:33:59,730
比如 神经失常?
A brain storm, for example?

565
00:34:02,790 --> 00:34:06,040
我没这样说
I did not say so.

566
00:34:06,170 --> 00:34:07,070
霍德赫斯勋爵 我们已经
Lord Holdhurst, we have

567
00:34:07,070 --> 00:34:09,910
占用了你很多宝贵时间
taken up too much of your valuable time.

568
00:34:14,090 --> 00:34:18,140
不错的人 责任心很强
Fine fellow, heavy responsibilities.

569
00:34:18,260 --> 00:34:20,390
是的 可他要抱住官职 仍需一番努力
Yes, but he has a struggle to keep up his position,

570
00:34:20,470 --> 00:34:25,060
而且他远不富有
and he's far from rich.

571
00:34:25,190 --> 00:34:29,690
你肯定注意到他的靴子换过鞋底
You noticed, of course, that his boots had been resoled.

572
00:34:29,770 --> 00:34:32,690
是吗?
Really?!

573
00:34:34,190 --> 00:34:35,240
今天没什么再能做了
I shall do nothing more today

574
00:34:35,320 --> 00:34:38,070
除非我寻找马车那事有回音
unless I get an answer to my cab inquiry.

575
00:34:38,160 --> 00:34:39,280
啊
Ah.

576
00:34:46,540 --> 00:34:49,580
好的
All right.

577
00:34:55,420 --> 00:34:57,010
哦 华生 我不会耽误太久
Oh, Watson, I won't detain you any longer

578
00:34:57,130 --> 00:34:59,140
你的正经工作时间
from your legitimate work.

579
00:34:59,970 --> 00:35:01,470
但是我会万分感激
But I should be extremely obliged

580
00:35:01,600 --> 00:35:03,770
如果你明天能陪我去一趟沃金
if you would come down to Woking with me tomorrow,

581
00:35:03,850 --> 00:35:06,480
跟今天坐的火车同班次
the same train that we took today.

582
00:35:06,600 --> 00:35:10,360
好的 当然
Yes, of course.

583
00:35:11,980 --> 00:35:14,610
晚安 福尔摩斯
Goodnight, Holmes.

584
00:35:19,660 --> 00:35:25,790
不 不 今晚我独自一人睡
No, no, tonight I shall sleep my own sleep, and alone.

585
00:35:25,910 --> 00:35:26,870
但是 珀西...
But Percy.

586
00:35:27,000 --> 00:35:29,000
福尔摩斯先生给了我新的希望
Mr. Holmes has imbued me with fresh hope,

587
00:35:29,120 --> 00:35:31,300
我觉得我有好转了
and I feel I'm on the mend.

588
00:35:32,130 --> 00:35:36,630
我们预约九月份去教堂 亲爱的
We have an appointment in church in September, my love,

589
00:35:36,720 --> 00:35:39,470
我不想取消预约
and I mean to keep it.

590
00:36:06,080 --> 00:36:08,330
他让护士离开了
He sent the nurse away.

591
00:36:08,460 --> 00:36:10,870
终于
At last.

592
00:36:10,960 --> 00:36:13,920
他太信任那个大侦探
He puts too much faith in the great detective.

593
00:36:14,040 --> 00:36:15,210
是你让他有生机
It's you that's kept his flame alive,

594
00:36:15,340 --> 00:36:16,710
不是什么侦探
not some detective.

595
00:36:16,840 --> 00:36:19,010
还有你 哥哥
And you, brother.

596
00:36:19,090 --> 00:36:22,410
没有你支持我的话 
Without you to support me-

597
00:37:34,420 --> 00:37:38,420
可能我成了某个可怕阴谋的中心
Could it be that I am the center of some monstrous conspiracy,

598
00:37:38,550 --> 00:37:41,670
他们的目标不仅是我的荣誉 还有我的命?
and that my life is aimed at, as well as my honor?

599
00:37:41,800 --> 00:37:44,090
据我所知 我在这世上没有仇敌!
I haven't as far as I know, an enemy in the world!

600
00:37:44,220 --> 00:37:47,510
你肯定只是不走运 老朋友
You certainly have had your share of misfortune, old chap.

601
00:37:49,640 --> 00:37:50,810
我想我找到现场了
I think I may have found the spot

602
00:37:50,930 --> 00:37:54,980
那家伙从这翻墙而过!
where the fella' scaled the wall!

603
00:37:57,900 --> 00:37:59,900
这里通向马路
It's towards the road.

604
00:37:59,980 --> 00:38:01,610
你觉得这是昨晚做的吗?
Ah, do you think this was done last night?

605
00:38:01,690 --> 00:38:03,150
我看是老痕迹了
It looks rather old to me.

606
00:38:03,240 --> 00:38:05,110
不 我想在这找不到什么线索
No, I fancy we shall get no help there.

607
00:38:05,200 --> 00:38:07,390
为什么入侵者
Now, why did the intruder

608
00:38:07,390 --> 00:38:10,540
选择爬面对庭院的窗而入?
 choose the window onto the courtyard?

609
00:38:10,660 --> 00:38:11,410
我觉得
I should have thought

610
00:38:11,490 --> 00:38:14,250
从房子这边进去更容易才是
this side of the house would have been easier.

611
00:38:14,330 --> 00:38:15,670
从庭院看这里更清楚
It's more visible from the courtyard.

612
00:38:15,790 --> 00:38:17,750
啊 是的 当然
Ah, yes, of course.

613
00:38:17,830 --> 00:38:20,130
你们以前受过这种惊吓吗?
Have you ever had an alarm like this before?

614
00:38:20,210 --> 00:38:21,690
屋子里没什么金银餐具
There's no plate in the house,

615
00:38:21,690 --> 00:38:22,920
或其它招引盗贼的东西?
 or anything to attract burglars?

616
00:38:23,010 --> 00:38:26,780
没什么值钱的
Nothing of value.

617
00:38:28,970 --> 00:38:30,310
伦敦的调查如何?
Was there anything in London?

618
00:38:30,390 --> 00:38:32,970
我们跟福布斯探员见过
Well, we've seen Inspector Forbes,

619
00:38:33,100 --> 00:38:35,270
还见过你叔叔
we've seen your uncle.

620
00:38:35,350 --> 00:38:37,480
福尔摩斯已经有了一两个行动
Holmes has set one or two things in motion.

621
00:38:37,560 --> 00:38:39,230
你们还没放弃
So you've not lost heart.

622
00:38:39,360 --> 00:38:41,920
哦 绝对不会!
Oh, by no means!

623
00:38:42,440 --> 00:38:43,780
上帝保佑你这么说
God bless you for saying that.

624
00:38:43,860 --> 00:38:46,910
只要我们保持耐心和勇气
If we keep our courage and patience,

625
00:38:47,030 --> 00:38:49,490
真相会水落石出的
the truth must come out.

626
00:38:52,870 --> 00:38:54,160
哈里森小姐
Miss Harrison,

627
00:38:54,290 --> 00:38:57,000
你后面几天一定要守在这房间里
you must remain in this room for the rest of the day.

628
00:38:57,120 --> 00:38:58,420
这个非常重要
It is of vital importance.

629
00:38:58,540 --> 00:39:00,290
今晚 你临睡前
Now, tonight, when you go to bed,

630
00:39:00,380 --> 00:39:03,460
从外面锁上那扇门 并保留着钥匙
lock that door from the outside and keep the key.

631
00:39:03,550 --> 00:39:05,080
但是珀西?       别对任何人说
But Percy?        Tell no one!

632
00:39:05,080 --> 00:39:07,010
马上向我保证!
Now, quick, promise!

633
00:39:09,260 --> 00:39:10,760
为什么你在这没精打采 亲爱的?
Why are you moping in here, honey?

634
00:39:11,390 --> 00:39:12,600
出来晒晒太阳
Come out in the sunshine.

635
00:39:12,720 --> 00:39:14,590
我愿陪你走走
I'll be your crockie.

636
00:39:16,350 --> 00:39:18,560
我有点头痛
I have a slight headache

637
00:39:18,690 --> 00:39:21,230
这个房间挺凉爽舒服
and this room is deliciously cool and soothing,

638
00:39:21,360 --> 00:39:22,900
谢谢 约瑟
thank you, Joseph.

639
00:39:23,020 --> 00:39:26,490
费普先生 尽管这件小事也要调查
Mr. Phelps, while we're investigating this minor affair

640
00:39:26,570 --> 00:39:31,320
但我们绝不能忽视主要的任务
we must not lose sight of our main inquiry.

641
00:39:31,410 --> 00:39:33,200
如果你能跟我们去一趟伦敦
It would help me very much

642
00:39:33,330 --> 00:39:35,000
将会对我有很大帮助
if you would come up to London with us.

643
00:39:35,080 --> 00:39:36,710
你感觉身体硬朗些了吗?
Do you feel strong enough?

644
00:39:36,790 --> 00:39:40,130
好的 如果你真觉得我能帮上忙的话
Yes, if you really think I can be of help.

645
00:39:40,250 --> 00:39:43,170
你想我在那待过夜吗?
Do you want me to stay the night?

646
00:39:43,250 --> 00:39:45,090
我正想如此建议
I was on the point of proposing it.

647
00:39:45,210 --> 00:39:47,170
如果那位夜间不速之客来访
Then if my friend of the night comes to visit me,

648
00:39:47,260 --> 00:39:48,470
他只能无功而返
he'll find the bird flown.

649
00:39:49,290 --> 00:39:50,280
但安妮怎么办?
But, what about Annie?

650
00:39:50,280 --> 00:39:52,180
啊 哈里森先生会照看她的
Ah, Mr. Harrison will look after her,

651
00:39:52,260 --> 00:39:55,100
我的朋友华生会护理你的
and my friend Watson will take care of your medical needs.

652
00:39:55,220 --> 00:39:57,480
一小时内能准备好出发吗?
Could you be ready to leave in an hour?

653
00:39:57,850 --> 00:40:00,500
一切听从你的 福尔摩斯先生
We are all in your hands, Mr. Holmes.

654
00:40:09,070 --> 00:40:10,860
有一两件事我要说明
There are one or two points I wish to clear up,

655
00:40:10,950 --> 00:40:15,080
费普先生 你不在这 反而帮了我的忙
and your absence, Mr. Phelps, will rather assist me.

656
00:40:15,200 --> 00:40:17,040
华生 到伦敦后
Watson, when you reach London

657
00:40:17,120 --> 00:40:18,960
送我们的朋友直接到贝克街
drive our friend straight to Baker Street

658
00:40:19,080 --> 00:40:22,290
一直陪着他直到我跟你们见面
and remain with him until I see you again.

659
00:40:22,420 --> 00:40:25,670
现在 先生们 我要走了
And now, gentlemen, I shall leave you.

660
00:40:25,800 --> 00:40:28,470
我们在伦敦的调查怎么办?
What about our investigation in London?!

661
00:40:28,590 --> 00:40:32,590
我希望能及时赶回伦敦吃早餐
I hope to be in London in time for breakfast.

662
00:40:33,600 --> 00:40:37,400
他真是个深不可测的家伙 华生
He really is the most inscrutable fellow, Watson.

663
00:41:02,460 --> 00:41:05,130
哦 你还在这里
Oh, you're still in here.

664
00:41:05,250 --> 00:41:06,670
你的头痛怎么样了?
How's your headache?

665
00:41:06,800 --> 00:41:08,500
好一些了
A little better.

666
00:41:10,380 --> 00:41:14,720
九周来第一次没有病人在身边
The first day for nine weeks without the invalid,

667
00:41:14,840 --> 00:41:18,140
你却仍选择待在这里
and you choose to spend it in here.

668
00:41:18,220 --> 00:41:21,060
习惯的力量
Force of habit.

669
00:41:21,180 --> 00:41:23,100
吃晚饭吗?
Are you dining tonight?

670
00:41:23,190 --> 00:41:26,190
我不饿 我想看书
I'm not hungry, and I'm enjoying my book.

671
00:41:26,310 --> 00:41:29,820
嗯 我懂
Mm, I understand.

672
00:41:29,940 --> 00:41:35,120
我可怜的妹妹 你经历了不少呀
My poor little sister, what a time you've had.

673
00:42:21,080 --> 00:42:23,620
福尔摩斯先生回来了 先生
That'll be Mr. Holmes returning now, sir.

674
00:42:25,290 --> 00:42:28,250
谢谢 霍乐斯
Thank you, Horace.

675
00:42:36,630 --> 00:42:38,850
他似乎精疲力竭了
He looks like a beaten man.

676
00:42:38,930 --> 00:42:41,500
我承认你说对了
I confess you may be right.

677
00:42:46,350 --> 00:42:49,400
我期望过高了
I'd hoped for so much!

678
00:43:02,450 --> 00:43:04,500
福尔摩斯 你受伤了!
Holmes, you're wounded!

679
00:43:04,620 --> 00:43:06,750
哦 只是自己不小心擦伤的
Oh, it's only a scratch through my own clumsiness.

680
00:43:06,830 --> 00:43:08,960
早上好 费普先生 你的案件
Good morning, Mr. Phelps, this case of yours

681
00:43:09,080 --> 00:43:14,010
是我办理过最黑暗的一宗
is certainly one of the darkest I have ever investigated.

682
00:43:16,470 --> 00:43:18,390
这是一次非同一般的经历
It has been a remarkable experience.

683
00:43:18,470 --> 00:43:21,430
快说吧 福尔摩斯 那绷带说明你冒过险
Oh, come along, Holmes, that bandage tells of adventures.

684
00:43:21,510 --> 00:43:23,100
发生什么了?
Now, what happened?

685
00:43:23,180 --> 00:43:24,470
先吃早餐 亲爱的华生
After breakfast, my dear Watson.

686
00:43:24,600 --> 00:43:25,770
别忘了我今早可是
Remember, I have breathed

687
00:43:25,850 --> 00:43:28,100
从萨里赶了30英里的路回来
30 miles of Surrey air this morning.

688
00:43:28,230 --> 00:43:31,440
我想 我寻马车的事还没回音吧?
There's been no answer to my cab inquiry, I suppose?

689
00:43:31,520 --> 00:43:33,820
不会每次都那么走运
Well, one cannot score every time.

690
00:43:33,940 --> 00:43:38,110
哈德森夫人 你总是应对自如
Mrs. Hudson, you have risen to the occasion.

691
00:43:38,200 --> 00:43:39,780
一起来吧 费普先生?
Won't you join us, Mr. Phelps?

692
00:43:39,910 --> 00:43:41,830
那是什么?
Now, what's in this?

693
00:43:41,910 --> 00:43:43,330
咖喱鸡 先生
Curried chicken, sir.

694
00:43:43,410 --> 00:43:43,990
这个呢?
And this?

695
00:43:44,120 --> 00:43:45,950
火腿和鸡蛋
Ham and eggs.

696
00:43:46,040 --> 00:43:47,750
她会做的菜不太多
Her cuisine is a little limited,

697
00:43:47,830 --> 00:43:51,420
但像所有苏格兰女人 她的早餐搭配得妙
but she has as good an idea of breakfast as any Scotswoman.

698
00:43:51,500 --> 00:43:54,340
你想吃什么 费普先生 咖喱鸡 鸡蛋 
Now, what will you take, Mr. Phelps, curried fowl, eggs,

699
00:43:54,460 --> 00:43:55,710
请自己来
or will you help yourself?

700
00:43:55,840 --> 00:43:57,130
谢谢 我什么都不想吃
Thank you. I can eat nothing.

701
00:43:57,260 --> 00:43:59,260
哦 请尝尝你前面那盘子里的菜
Oh, please, try the dish before you.

702
00:43:59,340 --> 00:44:01,470
谢谢 我真的不想吃
Thank you, I would really rather not.

703
00:44:01,590 --> 00:44:05,770
我想你不会不愿意帮我忙吧?
Oh, well, then, I suppose you have no objection to helping me?

704
00:44:10,350 --> 00:44:11,480
哦!
Oh!

705
00:44:22,200 --> 00:44:23,390
是协定
It's the treaty.

706
00:44:26,410 --> 00:44:30,040
是协定
It's the treaty.

707
00:44:32,670 --> 00:44:36,440
天啊 这是协定!
My God, it's the treaty!

708
00:44:37,420 --> 00:44:38,590
这是协定!
It's the treaty!

709
00:44:38,720 --> 00:44:40,310
这是协定!
It's the treaty!

710
00:44:45,100 --> 00:44:46,910
华生 白兰地
Watson, brandy.

711
00:44:48,930 --> 00:44:49,850
啊 好啦 好啦 好啦
Ah, there, there, there,

712
00:44:49,930 --> 00:44:52,400
我太坏了 不该突然放到你面前
it really was too bad of me to spring it on you like that,

713
00:44:52,520 --> 00:44:53,720
但是华生会告诉你
but Watson here will tell you

714
00:44:53,720 --> 00:44:56,480
我总忍不住来点戏剧性的变化
that I never can resist a touch of the dramatic.

715
00:44:56,570 --> 00:45:00,860
上帝保佑你 挽救了我的荣誉
God bless you for saving my honor.

716
00:45:02,360 --> 00:45:03,660
谢谢你 哈德森夫人
Thank you, Mrs. Hudson.

717
00:45:03,740 --> 00:45:10,410
哦 谢谢你如此体贴
Oh, thank you for your many considerations.

718
00:45:10,540 --> 00:45:16,380
苏格兰妇人的早餐 只是几张傻纸张!
A Scotswoman's breakfast, indeed, a silly bit of paper!

719
00:45:16,460 --> 00:45:22,840
请告诉我 你是如何找到的?
Please, tell me how you got it, where it was!

720
00:45:22,930 --> 00:45:24,550
离开你们后
After I left you,

721
00:45:24,680 --> 00:45:26,850
我走到英格兰的乡村
I settled myself into the English countryside

722
00:45:26,930 --> 00:45:30,200
享受可爱的下午
and spent a charming afternoon.

723
00:45:30,350 --> 00:45:33,500
我在那里待到黄昏
I remained there until dusk,

724
00:45:34,150 --> 00:45:36,770
然后回到你的房子
and then I returned to your house.

725
00:45:36,980 --> 00:45:38,570
我翻过墙
I clambered over the wall

726
00:45:38,650 --> 00:45:41,440
穿过小丛林
and made my way through the undergrowth

727
00:45:41,570 --> 00:45:43,240
直到去到马厩
until I reached the stables,

728
00:45:43,360 --> 00:45:48,280
刚好在你卧室窗户对面
just opposite your bedroom window.

729
00:45:48,370 --> 00:45:50,450
你房间的百叶窗还没被拉起
The blind in your window had not yet been drawn,

730
00:45:50,580 --> 00:45:54,000
我能看到哈里森小姐
and I could see Miss Harrison reading a book

731
00:45:54,120 --> 00:45:57,080
在油灯下读书
by the light from a lamp.

732
00:45:59,090 --> 00:46:02,420
她合上书时是10点15分
It was about a quarter-past ten when she closed the book,

733
00:46:02,510 --> 00:46:09,430
走过房间 手里拿着油灯
moved across the room, carrying the lamp with her.

734
00:46:09,510 --> 00:46:13,560
我清楚知道 她扭转在门上的钥匙
But I felt quite sure that she had turned the key in the lock.

735
00:46:13,640 --> 00:46:14,940
钥匙?
Key?

736
00:46:15,060 --> 00:46:16,690
是我给她的指示
The instructions I gave her,

737
00:46:16,810 --> 00:46:19,020
她都一一做到
which she carried out to the letter.

738
00:46:19,150 --> 00:46:22,780
费普先生 她是位有可贵性格的女士
Mr. Phelps, she is a lady of rare character.

739
00:46:22,900 --> 00:46:23,990
没有她的合作
Without her cooperation,

740
00:46:24,110 --> 00:46:27,450
你手里就不会拿着文件了
you would not have that paper in your hand now.

741
00:46:27,570 --> 00:46:29,910
艰辛的守夜
It was a weary vigil,

742
00:46:30,290 --> 00:46:33,370
但是有种冒险者躺在
but it had the sort of excitement a sportsman feels

743
00:46:33,500 --> 00:46:35,290
河道前 等着大猎物时
when he lies before the watercourse

744
00:46:35,370 --> 00:46:37,700
的兴奋心情
and waits for the big game.

745
00:46:43,010 --> 00:46:45,300
发生什么了 发生什么了?
What happened, what happened?!

746
00:46:45,970 --> 00:46:48,300
大概临晨两点左右
It was about 2:00 o'clock in the morning,

747
00:46:48,390 --> 00:46:53,810
我听到轻微推开插销的声音
when I heard the gentle sound of a bolt being pushed back.

748
00:47:35,600 --> 00:47:36,730
好了
All right.

749
00:47:36,850 --> 00:47:40,520
好了 福尔摩斯 你想对我怎么样?
All right, Holmes, what you gonna do with me?

750
00:47:42,480 --> 00:47:45,400
我得到我想要的了
I've got what I want.

751
00:47:45,490 --> 00:47:48,860
哇!      滚
Ow!        Run.

752
00:48:04,000 --> 00:48:05,840
约瑟!
Joseph!

753
00:48:07,130 --> 00:48:09,760
你让他跑了?
You let him go?!

754
00:48:10,390 --> 00:48:12,850
我用电报告知了福布斯探员所有细节
I wired full particulars to Inspector Forbes.

755
00:48:12,930 --> 00:48:14,930
如果他能迅速去抓犯人 那就没问题
If he's quick enough to catch his bird, well and good.

756
00:48:15,060 --> 00:48:17,600
不过我倒怀疑犯人已经人去楼空
But if, as I shrewdly suspect, he finds the nest empty,

757
00:48:17,730 --> 00:48:21,100
不过这样对政府来说反而更好
why, all the better for the government.

758
00:48:21,230 --> 00:48:22,900
我想不但霍德赫斯勋爵  
I fancy Lord Holdhurst, for one,

759
00:48:23,020 --> 00:48:26,320
而且珀西・费普先生
and Mr. Percy Phelps for another,

760
00:48:26,440 --> 00:48:30,660
都不想让这案子上治安法庭吧
would much rather the affair never got to a police court.

761
00:48:30,780 --> 00:48:34,240
天啊 你是说在这十周的痛苦经历中
My God, do you tell me that during my 10 long weeks of agony

762
00:48:34,370 --> 00:48:40,420
被盗的文件一直在我身边?
the stolen papers were in the very room with me all the time?

763
00:48:40,540 --> 00:48:45,210
而约瑟 恶棍 小偷!
And Joseph, a villain and a thief!

764
00:48:45,300 --> 00:48:48,760
据我所知 他在股票投资中损失了一大笔钱
From what I gather, he had lost heavily dabbling in stocks,

765
00:48:48,880 --> 00:48:51,430
还隐瞒着他父亲
and concealed the fact from his father,

766
00:48:51,550 --> 00:48:54,390
他父亲是个严守旧观念的人
a man of strictly conservative habits.

767
00:48:54,470 --> 00:48:57,810
可他为此践踏亲生妹妹的幸福
Yes, but his own sister's happiness,

768
00:48:57,930 --> 00:49:01,770
还有你的名声和健康!
and your reputation, your health!

769
00:49:01,850 --> 00:49:05,440
他知道你常工作到很晚
He knew that you often worked late,

770
00:49:05,520 --> 00:49:07,940
他当时在城里和股票投资商共进晚餐
and he was in town having dinner with his stockbroker,

771
00:49:08,030 --> 00:49:09,610
他对我提过
as he told me.

772
00:49:09,690 --> 00:49:13,030
但他到九点半就没事做了
But he was free by half past 9:00,

773
00:49:13,160 --> 00:49:17,240
便顺路去你的办公室 从侧门进去
and called by your office, entering through the side door.

774
00:49:17,330 --> 00:49:19,500
珀西?
Percy?

775
00:49:27,340 --> 00:49:29,050
他看没人
Finding no one in there

776
00:49:29,170 --> 00:49:32,930
灯却亮着 很明显工作还没结束
but the light on and work evidently in progress,

777
00:49:33,010 --> 00:49:35,260
他拉了铃
he rang the bell.

778
00:49:35,350 --> 00:49:39,470
那瞬间 他看到你桌子上的文件
The instant he did so, his eye caught the paper on the table.

779
00:49:39,600 --> 00:49:42,310
他马上意识到这是一个机会
He knew at once that chance had put in his way

780
00:49:42,440 --> 00:49:45,500
一个极有价值的官方文件
a state document of immense value,

781
00:49:58,450 --> 00:49:59,950
他一个人回到沃金
returned alone to Woking

782
00:50:00,080 --> 00:50:03,420
并把文件藏到自认为很安全的地方
and concealed it in what he thought was a very safe place,

783
00:50:03,540 --> 00:50:05,710
打算在一两天后转移它
intending to remove it in a day or two,

784
00:50:05,830 --> 00:50:07,420
然后送到法国大使馆
and take it to the French embassy

785
00:50:07,540 --> 00:50:10,550
或卖给能出高价的地方
or wherever he thought a long price was to be had.

786
00:50:10,670 --> 00:50:12,880
那里没人 那里没人!
There's nobody there, there's nobody there!

787
00:50:16,050 --> 00:50:20,220
然后你突然回来
Then came your sudden return.

788
00:50:20,350 --> 00:50:23,810
他毫无预兆地被要求搬出房间
Without a moment's warning he was bundled out of his room

789
00:50:23,940 --> 00:50:25,020
从那一刻起
and from that moment on,

790
00:50:25,150 --> 00:50:28,060
那房间总是有至少你俩在
there were always at least two of you in there,

791
00:50:28,190 --> 00:50:34,700
妨碍了他取回宝贝 让他很恼火
preventing him from regaining his treasure, maddening for him.

792
00:50:34,820 --> 00:50:37,200
我的怀疑变成肯定
My suspicions became certainties

793
00:50:37,320 --> 00:50:38,430
当有人企图在让护士
when the attempt to break in

794
00:50:38,430 --> 00:50:41,610
离开的头天晚上闯入房间
was made on the first night that the hired nurse was absent,

795
00:50:41,610 --> 00:50:44,210
就表示了入侵者
which showed that the intruder

796
00:50:44,290 --> 00:50:47,050
非常熟悉那个家的情况
was well accustomed with the ways of the house.

797
00:50:47,880 --> 00:50:51,000
最终 他的机会来了
At last, he had his chance.

798
00:50:51,090 --> 00:50:54,470
但你的醒来又吓跑了他
But you baffled him with your wakefulness.

799
00:50:54,590 --> 00:50:58,350
是的 我没有喝安眠药!
Yes! I didn't take my sleeping draft!

800
00:50:58,430 --> 00:51:01,060
但你来伦敦让他又有一次机会
But he had another chance when you came up to London.

801
00:51:01,140 --> 00:51:02,380
我让哈里森小姐
I kept Miss Harrison

802
00:51:02,380 --> 00:51:06,140
整天待在房里 以防他提前下手
in the room all day so as to anticipate him.

803
00:51:07,600 --> 00:51:10,450
可既然你知道文件在房间里?
But if you already knew the papers were in the room?

804
00:51:10,610 --> 00:51:12,360
我只是假设有可能
I thought they probably were,

805
00:51:12,440 --> 00:51:14,570
我可不想拆开所有壁脚
but I had no desire to rip up all the skirting

806
00:51:14,650 --> 00:51:16,070
来找文件
in search of them.

807
00:51:16,150 --> 00:51:17,990
让他引我知道藏处
By allowing him to lead me to the hiding place,

808
00:51:18,110 --> 00:51:20,620
节省了我大量功夫
I saved myself an infinity of trouble.

809
00:51:20,740 --> 00:51:23,790
还能逮个正着!
And caught him red-handed!

810
00:51:23,910 --> 00:51:25,330
正确
Quite so.

811
00:51:25,460 --> 00:51:27,120
但他为什么要从窗户进来
Yes, but why did he try the window

812
00:51:27,250 --> 00:51:29,040
他也能从正门进来呀?
when he might have come in through the door?

813
00:51:29,130 --> 00:51:31,420
他想假装是外贼 可以的话
To appear to be a burglar, and if necessary,

814
00:51:31,500 --> 00:51:34,610
他想从庭院逃跑出去
make good his escape across the courtyard.

815
00:51:35,130 --> 00:51:36,760
刀子
The knife,

816
00:51:36,880 --> 00:51:40,050
他是不是有杀人的企图?
you don't think he had any murderous intentions?

817
00:51:41,140 --> 00:51:41,930
亲爱的朋友
My dear fellow,

818
00:51:42,010 --> 00:51:44,810
我不相信约瑟・哈里森先生
I can only say that Mr. Joseph Harrison is a gentleman

819
00:51:44,930 --> 00:51:49,440
是肯大发善心的君子
to whose mercy I should be extremely unwilling to trust.

820
00:51:49,560 --> 00:51:52,750
一位年轻女士来找你了 费普先生
That will be a young lady for you, Mr. Phelps.

821
00:51:55,740 --> 00:51:56,860
安妮!
Annie!

822
00:51:56,990 --> 00:52:00,660
我给她留了口信 醒来后来伦敦
I left her a note to come to London the moment she woke.

823
00:52:00,780 --> 00:52:02,370
但是费普先生
But Mr. Phelps,

824
00:52:02,490 --> 00:52:06,460
她一点都不知道她哥哥的罪行
she knows nothing as yet of her brother's criminality.

825
00:52:07,960 --> 00:52:09,620
哦 好的
Oh, yes.

826
00:52:11,000 --> 00:52:15,760
亲爱的福尔摩斯 真是感激不尽
My dear Holmes, I can't thank you enough.

827
00:52:19,180 --> 00:52:22,710
我要立即下去解释这一切
I shall go down at once and explain everything.

828
00:52:25,810 --> 00:52:31,310
珀西 再见 祝你好运!
Percy, good-bye, and good luck!

829
00:52:35,440 --> 00:52:38,990
谢谢你挽救了我的幸福
Thank you for restoring my happiness.

830
00:52:41,450 --> 00:52:44,160
门口有位年轻女士 先生
There's a young lady at the door, sir.

831
00:52:45,340 --> 00:52:48,980
福尔摩斯先生 热水!
Mr. Holmes, hot water!

832
00:52:51,880 --> 00:52:53,210
谢谢
Thank you.

833
