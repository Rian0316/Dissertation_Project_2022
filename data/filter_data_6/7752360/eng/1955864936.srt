1
00:00:04,158 --> 00:00:05,402
What are you doing?

2
00:00:05,471 --> 00:00:07,190
I heard you could
punch a hole in these

3
00:00:07,268 --> 00:00:08,815
and make them double-sided.

4
00:00:09,002 --> 00:00:10,418
Then it would have more storage?

5
00:00:10,487 --> 00:00:13,650
Yes, but I didn't pay
for a double-sided floppy disk.

6
00:00:13,729 --> 00:00:14,846
So?

7
00:00:14,915 --> 00:00:16,684
So it's an ethical dilemma.

8
00:00:17,284 --> 00:00:19,572
We have to take a shower
in the locker room next period,

9
00:00:19,641 --> 00:00:21,182
and that's what
you're worried about?

10
00:00:21,353 --> 00:00:24,354
Actually, I have
a bathing suit under my pants.

11
00:00:27,768 --> 00:00:28,807
Whoa.

12
00:00:28,936 --> 00:00:31,775
That girl just took
a book on geostatistics.

13
00:00:31,902 --> 00:00:33,104
Yeah, so?

14
00:00:33,173 --> 00:00:35,869
That's not required reading
for any science course.

15
00:00:35,964 --> 00:00:38,111
Maybe she wants
to squash a spider with it.

16
00:00:38,331 --> 00:00:40,596
No, look, she's reading it.

17
00:00:41,059 --> 00:00:43,205
Who is this mystery woman?

18
00:00:43,385 --> 00:00:45,307
Should we invite her
to have lunch with us?

19
00:00:45,405 --> 00:00:47,643
I don't know. So far,
it's just been you and me,

20
00:00:47,712 --> 00:00:48,847
and we know that works.

21
00:00:48,916 --> 00:00:51,118
Do we really want
to mess with success?

22
00:00:51,366 --> 00:00:53,455
We could think of it
as an experiment.

23
00:00:53,938 --> 00:00:57,002
Oh, you do know
how to push my buttons.

24
00:00:57,264 --> 00:00:58,596
All right, go ask her.

25
00:00:58,665 --> 00:00:59,766
Why me?

26
00:00:59,930 --> 00:01:03,099
Your lack of testosterone makes
you adorable to women.

27
00:01:03,900 --> 00:01:06,010
I can't argue with that.

28
00:01:10,322 --> 00:01:11,587
Hello.

29
00:01:11,673 --> 00:01:12,874
Hello.

30
00:01:13,007 --> 00:01:14,408
My name is Sheldon.

31
00:01:14,751 --> 00:01:16,205
Yeah, you're Sheldon Cooper.

32
00:01:16,305 --> 00:01:17,545
You know who I am?

33
00:01:17,724 --> 00:01:19,831
Well, there's only one
nine-year-old in high school,

34
00:01:19,900 --> 00:01:21,385
and you still have
your baby teeth.

35
00:01:21,814 --> 00:01:24,533
She knows who I am.
It's going well.

36
00:01:26,536 --> 00:01:27,604
What do you want?

37
00:01:27,684 --> 00:01:30,877
Would you like to have lunch
with me and my friend?

38
00:01:31,416 --> 00:01:32,649
Why?

39
00:01:32,718 --> 00:01:33,786
Why else?

40
00:01:33,855 --> 00:01:35,594
So we can have
a spirited conversation

41
00:01:35,663 --> 00:01:37,221
about geostatistics.

42
00:01:37,333 --> 00:01:39,643
You really are
as smart as everybody says.

43
00:01:39,856 --> 00:01:43,627
My teeth are small, but my
prefrontal cortex is enormous.

44
00:01:45,322 --> 00:01:48,283
<i>♪ Nobody else
is stronger than I am ♪</i>

45
00:01:48,460 --> 00:01:50,924
<i>♪ Yesterday I moved a mountain ♪</i>

46
00:01:50,993 --> 00:01:53,729
<i>♪ I bet I could be your hero ♪</i>

47
00:01:53,798 --> 00:01:56,581
<i>♪ I am a mighty little man ♪</i>

48
00:01:56,650 --> 00:01:59,869
<i>♪ I am a mighty little man. ♪</i>

49
00:01:59,937 --> 00:02:02,337

50
00:02:06,924 --> 00:02:08,905
The addition of Libby brought

51
00:02:08,974 --> 00:02:11,896
a level of sophistication
to our lunchtime discussion.

52
00:02:12,240 --> 00:02:14,632
Her mom also packed
extra string cheese,

53
00:02:14,701 --> 00:02:16,857
which is a well-known
social lubricant.

54
00:02:17,069 --> 00:02:18,438
You're gonna be a geologist.

55
00:02:18,507 --> 00:02:19,733
That's fascinating.

56
00:02:19,802 --> 00:02:20,873
Why'd you choose that?

57
00:02:20,940 --> 00:02:22,775
When I was a little girl,
my grandparents took me

58
00:02:22,842 --> 00:02:24,893
to Carlsbad Caverns,
and I was hooked.

59
00:02:25,057 --> 00:02:27,392
Exploring caves,
that is super cool.

60
00:02:27,643 --> 00:02:31,351
Disagree. Dark,
enclosed spaces are terrifying.

61
00:02:31,877 --> 00:02:34,057
I get scared putting on
a sweatshirt.

62
00:02:34,128 --> 00:02:35,588
Hmm.
I've seen it.

63
00:02:35,657 --> 00:02:37,225
Pretty entertaining.

64
00:02:37,449 --> 00:02:39,563
Do you know what you're going
to major in in college?

65
00:02:39,632 --> 00:02:42,862
I'm leaning towards quantum
chromodynamics, but who knows?

66
00:02:42,931 --> 00:02:45,807
A few years ago, I would've
said choo-choo trains.

67
00:02:46,165 --> 00:02:47,252
What about you?

68
00:02:47,321 --> 00:02:48,846
Oh, geology for sure.

69
00:02:49,001 --> 00:02:50,049
Hmm.

70
00:02:50,118 --> 00:02:52,198
Really?
When did you decide that?

71
00:02:52,267 --> 00:02:54,682
A long time ago.
Eat your apple slices.

72
00:02:58,518 --> 00:03:00,456
So we eat in the
library every day.

73
00:03:00,573 --> 00:03:01,870
You're welcome to join us.

74
00:03:01,939 --> 00:03:03,495
It's much better
than the cafeteria.

75
00:03:03,564 --> 00:03:06,901
It's quiet, and a lot less food
gets thrown at us.

76
00:03:07,343 --> 00:03:10,206
Yeah. Maybe
I'll see y'all tomorrow.

77
00:03:10,502 --> 00:03:11,784
Right.

78
00:03:11,942 --> 00:03:13,674
Maybe y'all will.

79
00:03:14,160 --> 00:03:15,901
Bye, Libby.

80
00:03:17,096 --> 00:03:18,440
"Y'all"?

81
00:03:18,564 --> 00:03:19,752
I'm assimilating.

82
00:03:19,821 --> 00:03:21,198
Shut up.

83
00:03:28,659 --> 00:03:30,417
So how was school today?

84
00:03:30,486 --> 00:03:31,823
Sheldon's got a girlfriend.

85
00:03:31,895 --> 00:03:33,663
- What?
- That's not true.

86
00:03:33,732 --> 00:03:36,213
Oh, yes, it is. I seen him
talking to her at school.

87
00:03:36,317 --> 00:03:38,799
Sheldon Lee Cooper, you dog.

88
00:03:38,868 --> 00:03:40,026
Is she cute?

89
00:03:40,095 --> 00:03:41,496
Compared to what?

90
00:03:42,241 --> 00:03:43,976
What grade is she in?

91
00:03:44,045 --> 00:03:45,151
Eleventh.

92
00:03:45,220 --> 00:03:46,471
An older woman.

93
00:03:46,800 --> 00:03:48,002
Nice.

94
00:03:48,088 --> 00:03:49,807
Most everybody's older than me.

95
00:03:49,876 --> 00:03:51,188
Why is that nice?

96
00:03:51,789 --> 00:03:53,106
So what do you think, George?

97
00:03:53,175 --> 00:03:55,424
Is it time to have
"the talk" with him?

98
00:03:55,615 --> 00:03:56,783
What talk?

99
00:03:56,874 --> 00:03:58,932
No talk. Nobody's talking.

100
00:03:59,138 --> 00:04:01,874
If "the talk" is in regards
to human reproduction,

101
00:04:01,995 --> 00:04:04,167
I already understand
how that works.

102
00:04:04,236 --> 00:04:05,424
How do you know that?

103
00:04:05,493 --> 00:04:06,768
I told him.

104
00:04:08,142 --> 00:04:09,315
Oh, Lord.

105
00:04:13,198 --> 00:04:15,621
<i>And so,
our little social circle</i>

106
00:04:15,690 --> 00:04:17,651
<i>grew from two to three.</i>

107
00:04:17,780 --> 00:04:20,526
<i>An early example of how people
are just drawn to me.</i>

108
00:04:20,760 --> 00:04:22,806
Are you saying
that without geology,

109
00:04:22,875 --> 00:04:25,166
there'd be
no theory of evolution?

110
00:04:25,281 --> 00:04:27,189
Charles Lyell taught
Charles Darwin

111
00:04:27,266 --> 00:04:29,392
the Earth was much, much older
than anyone thought,

112
00:04:29,461 --> 00:04:31,377
which gave Darwin the courage
to figure out

113
00:04:31,446 --> 00:04:33,845
all species evolved
over billions of years.

114
00:04:33,993 --> 00:04:35,661
That's good.
I can use that

115
00:04:35,730 --> 00:04:38,283
to humiliate my pastor
at Sunday school.

116
00:04:39,109 --> 00:04:40,642
I don't know
what's more beautiful,

117
00:04:40,711 --> 00:04:42,345
your mind or your eyes.

118
00:04:42,767 --> 00:04:44,088
Tam, please.

119
00:04:44,178 --> 00:04:45,588
We're eating.

120
00:04:55,775 --> 00:04:57,954
You know spying
on kids is creepy.

121
00:04:58,348 --> 00:05:01,431
I wasn't spying on kids,
I was s-spying on your brother.

122
00:05:01,569 --> 00:05:03,337
Why won't you just go inside?

123
00:05:03,406 --> 00:05:05,446
Well, then, it wouldn't
be spying, now would it?

124
00:05:06,821 --> 00:05:08,298
Oh.

125
00:05:08,865 --> 00:05:10,165
Oh, what?

126
00:05:10,250 --> 00:05:12,052
You didn't mention
she was black.

127
00:05:12,121 --> 00:05:13,722
Was I supposed to?

128
00:05:13,798 --> 00:05:15,599
No, 'course not.

129
00:05:16,148 --> 00:05:17,579
Then why bring it up?

130
00:05:17,870 --> 00:05:19,939
It just wasn't
what I was expecting.

131
00:05:20,293 --> 00:05:21,509
What were you expecting?

132
00:05:21,598 --> 00:05:22,798
It's a big school.

133
00:05:22,881 --> 00:05:24,616
Why are you right here?

134
00:05:24,808 --> 00:05:27,212
They've got some books in there
about Martin Luther King.

135
00:05:27,281 --> 00:05:29,079
Maybe you should go read one.

136
00:05:33,763 --> 00:05:35,612
Morning.

137
00:05:36,431 --> 00:05:38,487
So why did it take
people so long

138
00:05:38,556 --> 00:05:40,191
to believe in continental drift,

139
00:05:40,259 --> 00:05:42,728
when it's obvious
that Africa and South America

140
00:05:42,797 --> 00:05:45,487
- fit together like a puzzle?
- No, they don't.

141
00:05:46,022 --> 00:05:47,902
People didn't understand
continental drift

142
00:05:47,971 --> 00:05:50,330
because they didn't understand
seafloor spreading.

143
00:05:51,554 --> 00:05:52,554
What?

144
00:05:52,658 --> 00:05:53,742
I'm both threatened

145
00:05:53,811 --> 00:05:55,940
and delighted by your brain.

146
00:05:56,209 --> 00:05:57,963
I'm just delighted by it.

147
00:05:59,299 --> 00:06:00,830
They do fit.

148
00:06:01,213 --> 00:06:02,666
That's nuts.

149
00:06:11,260 --> 00:06:13,949
"Geologists lead
a sedimentary lifestyle."

150
00:06:14,018 --> 00:06:15,893
Libby, that is a good one.

151
00:06:17,642 --> 00:06:20,221
Can you believe
what's going on with him?

152
00:06:20,290 --> 00:06:21,377
I know.

153
00:06:21,446 --> 00:06:23,438
He's been on the phone with
that girl for almost an hour.

154
00:06:23,507 --> 00:06:25,002
Sheldon's got
a girlfriend.

155
00:06:25,071 --> 00:06:26,114
What are the odds?

156
00:06:26,183 --> 00:06:27,761
She's not a girlfriend,

157
00:06:27,830 --> 00:06:30,885
it's more of a mental rapport.

158
00:06:30,963 --> 00:06:32,636
That's where it starts.

159
00:06:32,703 --> 00:06:35,049
I did win you over
with my superior intellect.

160
00:06:35,118 --> 00:06:37,221
It was your motorcycle
and you know it.

161
00:06:37,315 --> 00:06:39,477
Good thing it wasn't
your masculine physique,

162
00:06:39,544 --> 00:06:41,279
because that is long gone.

163
00:06:42,513 --> 00:06:44,815
Why do you think
I kept the motorcycle?

164
00:06:45,674 --> 00:06:47,815
How come he gets to tie up
the phone and I can't?

165
00:06:47,916 --> 00:06:50,244
Because what is happening
in there is called a miracle,

166
00:06:50,313 --> 00:06:53,174
and God-fearing people do not
get in the way of those.

167
00:06:53,369 --> 00:06:54,392
Hey, Georgie,

168
00:06:54,459 --> 00:06:55,714
if you ever find a girlfriend,

169
00:06:55,783 --> 00:06:57,596
maybe you can go on
a double date with your brother.

170
00:06:57,664 --> 00:06:59,283
She's not his girlfriend.

171
00:06:59,352 --> 00:07:00,932
And I can find one...

172
00:07:01,332 --> 00:07:02,589
I'm just not looking.

173
00:07:02,658 --> 00:07:04,502
<i>Yes, that was a geology joke.</i>

174
00:07:04,650 --> 00:07:06,925
We gotta get that Sports
Illustrated swimsuit issue

175
00:07:06,994 --> 00:07:09,574
away from him before he's
ruined forever.

176
00:07:10,119 --> 00:07:12,470
<i>Oh, Libby, Libby, Libby.</i>

177
00:07:12,603 --> 00:07:14,128
What is happening?

178
00:07:14,197 --> 00:07:15,613
<i>What was happening was,</i>

179
00:07:15,680 --> 00:07:17,401
<i>like many men before me,</i>

180
00:07:17,470 --> 00:07:21,573
<i>I was being seduced
by the exotic world of geology.</i>

181
00:07:21,642 --> 00:07:23,064

188
00:07:37,061 --> 00:07:39,767
We searched for tektites
in a nearby ravine.

189
00:07:39,836 --> 00:07:41,964
Tektites are natural glass

190
00:07:42,033 --> 00:07:44,415
formed
during meteorite impacts.

191
00:07:44,657 --> 00:07:46,635
They also bear
a close resemblance

192
00:07:46,704 --> 00:07:49,557
to raccoon feces,
so I wisely adopted

193
00:07:49,626 --> 00:07:52,016
a "no touching tektites"
policy.

194
00:07:52,083 --> 00:07:53,884

196
00:07:56,180 --> 00:07:57,549
It's called perfect cleavage

197
00:07:57,618 --> 00:07:59,408
when gypsum separates
this cleanly.

198
00:07:59,478 --> 00:08:01,306
<i>I was so proud of Tam</i>

199
00:08:01,375 --> 00:08:03,556
<i>for not making
an immature cleavage joke.</i>

200
00:08:03,626 --> 00:08:05,830
Look at me,
I'm touching cleavage.

201
00:08:06,056 --> 00:08:07,798
<i>Until he made one.</i>

202
00:08:08,384 --> 00:08:11,618
<i>And, like
Mother Nature's piñata,</i>

203
00:08:11,687 --> 00:08:15,031
geodes contained
a secret surprise inside.

204
00:08:15,180 --> 00:08:16,486
But you didn't have to suffer

205
00:08:16,563 --> 00:08:18,305
through a birthday party
to enjoy it.

206
00:08:22,812 --> 00:08:24,238
How's it going?

207
00:08:24,307 --> 00:08:26,234
Well, I think I figured out
the problem.

208
00:08:26,320 --> 00:08:27,844
What is it?

209
00:08:28,180 --> 00:08:29,867
I'm a terrible mechanic.

210
00:08:30,054 --> 00:08:31,805
- What's up?
- Well,

211
00:08:31,898 --> 00:08:33,866
Sheldon's been spending
quite a bit of time

212
00:08:33,935 --> 00:08:35,360
with this Libby girl, lately.

213
00:08:35,427 --> 00:08:36,616
Yeah, so?

214
00:08:36,685 --> 00:08:38,248
So isn't he a little young

215
00:08:38,349 --> 00:08:39,597
to be hanging with teenagers?

216
00:08:39,664 --> 00:08:41,686
Oh, he's only young
on the outside.

217
00:08:41,755 --> 00:08:43,295
Inside, he's an old man.

218
00:08:43,364 --> 00:08:44,755
I'm being serious.

219
00:08:44,869 --> 00:08:46,263
So am I.

220
00:08:46,451 --> 00:08:49,396
And with that bowtie,
he's old on the outside, too.

221
00:08:50,185 --> 00:08:51,976
Sorry I bothered.

222
00:08:52,521 --> 00:08:54,037
Hang on.

223
00:08:55,772 --> 00:08:57,163
What did you think
was gonna happen

224
00:08:57,232 --> 00:08:58,638
when we sent him to high school?

225
00:08:58,763 --> 00:09:01,171
I don't know,
that he'd learn stuff,

226
00:09:01,240 --> 00:09:04,013
and then, come back home
and be my baby forever.

227
00:09:04,384 --> 00:09:06,121
Mare, it's good for him.

228
00:09:06,427 --> 00:09:09,084
He may start college in a couple
years, what happens then?

229
00:09:09,263 --> 00:09:13,099
Off the top of my head,
he and I share a dorm room.

230
00:09:14,130 --> 00:09:16,826
You know I'd laugh at that
if I didn't kind of believe you.

231
00:09:26,564 --> 00:09:27,799
What are you doing?

232
00:09:27,911 --> 00:09:31,916
I need to use the bathroom,
but it can get uncivilized in there.

233
00:09:32,185 --> 00:09:33,451
Anyone in there now?

234
00:09:33,518 --> 00:09:36,091
I don't know.
I was afraid to find out.

235
00:09:36,669 --> 00:09:38,560
Anybody in here?

236
00:09:39,957 --> 00:09:41,163
Go ahead.

237
00:09:41,232 --> 00:09:42,661
I'll stand guard.

238
00:09:42,935 --> 00:09:45,208
Where have you been all my life?

239
00:09:51,591 --> 00:09:53,169
I don't think so.

240
00:09:54,021 --> 00:09:55,131
I gotta pee.

241
00:09:55,263 --> 00:09:58,021
That's your problem.
Keep moving.

242
00:10:03,459 --> 00:10:05,544
Thank you.
Happy to help.

243
00:10:05,638 --> 00:10:07,716
Is there any chance
you'd be available

244
00:10:07,841 --> 00:10:09,587
to stand guard at 1:45?

245
00:10:09,896 --> 00:10:11,456
You have a bathroom schedule?

246
00:10:11,575 --> 00:10:12,923
You don't?

247
00:10:13,177 --> 00:10:14,392
See you later.

248
00:10:15,192 --> 00:10:17,678
<i>Whoever said the
quickest way to a man's heart</i>

249
00:10:17,747 --> 00:10:19,021
is through his stomach

250
00:10:19,185 --> 00:10:22,107
did not consider
his tiny bladder.

251
00:10:23,130 --> 00:10:26,692
I think the best space shuttle
name so far is Discovery.

252
00:10:26,804 --> 00:10:28,272
What about Challenger?

253
00:10:28,357 --> 00:10:30,474
- Too in-your-face.
- Atlantis?

254
00:10:30,614 --> 00:10:32,756
A fictional island
that couldn't stay afloat?

255
00:10:32,825 --> 00:10:33,857
I don't think so.

256
00:10:33,950 --> 00:10:35,879
There's the Enterprise.
There is,

257
00:10:35,946 --> 00:10:38,231
and it's on Star Trek,
where it belongs.

258
00:10:38,497 --> 00:10:40,280
You know they're playing
a space shuttle movie

259
00:10:40,348 --> 00:10:41,693
at the Museum of
Natural Science.

260
00:10:41,762 --> 00:10:43,748
- It's in IMAX.
- I heard about that.

261
00:10:43,817 --> 00:10:46,035
- The screen is supposed to be huge.
- They also have

262
00:10:46,104 --> 00:10:47,378
a great geology exhibit.

263
00:10:47,447 --> 00:10:48,892
Well, it's in Houston...

264
00:10:48,981 --> 00:10:51,317
How are we gonna get there?
I'll drive.

265
00:10:51,411 --> 00:10:53,169
Oh, I would love to
see a movie with you.

266
00:10:53,325 --> 00:10:55,209
Don't you need to ask
your parents first?

267
00:10:55,278 --> 00:10:58,028
No, Sheldon, I don't.
But won't they worry where you are?

268
00:10:58,097 --> 00:10:59,317
They'll be fine.

269
00:10:59,520 --> 00:11:00,997
Count me in.

270
00:11:02,318 --> 00:11:04,185
Glad you're not my son.

271
00:11:07,349 --> 00:11:10,515
And now he wants to see a
movie in Houston with them.

272
00:11:10,582 --> 00:11:11,733
Why Houston?

273
00:11:11,802 --> 00:11:14,251
I don't know,
it's in MixMax or something.

274
00:11:14,392 --> 00:11:16,096
So you're saying I got
to drive to Houston?

275
00:11:16,165 --> 00:11:18,291
No. This girl Libby's
gonna drive.

276
00:11:18,360 --> 00:11:19,627
Great.

277
00:11:19,696 --> 00:11:21,151
It's not great, George.

278
00:11:21,220 --> 00:11:23,448
I don't want my little boy
in some car

279
00:11:23,517 --> 00:11:25,026
with a teenager
behind the wheel.

280
00:11:25,095 --> 00:11:26,797
All high school kids drive.

281
00:11:26,864 --> 00:11:28,732
Yeah? Well, I
don't like it.

282
00:11:28,964 --> 00:11:30,198
Would you let me
get in a car

283
00:11:30,267 --> 00:11:31,791
with a stranger
when I was young?

284
00:11:31,860 --> 00:11:34,572
Well, nobody ever asked you out,
so it didn't really matter.

285
00:11:43,329 --> 00:11:45,790
Hey. I want to talk to you.

286
00:11:45,970 --> 00:11:48,104
Hold on. Let me bring
this into the station

287
00:11:48,173 --> 00:11:50,626
so as not to disappoint
my commuters.

288
00:11:50,821 --> 00:11:53,057
They'd like to get home
to their families.

289
00:11:56,845 --> 00:11:59,729
I gave it a lot of thought,
and I'm afraid I can't allow you

290
00:11:59,798 --> 00:12:01,604
to drive to Houston
with your friends.

291
00:12:01,673 --> 00:12:02,854
Why?

292
00:12:02,923 --> 00:12:04,664
Well, honey, you're
still a little boy.

293
00:12:04,733 --> 00:12:05,801
I don't think it's right.

294
00:12:05,868 --> 00:12:08,462
I'm not a little boy.
I'm a high school student.

295
00:12:08,531 --> 00:12:10,438
I'm sorry, I made up my mind.

296
00:12:10,709 --> 00:12:12,524
If you'd really like
to see this movie,

297
00:12:12,593 --> 00:12:13,813
I'm willing to drive you.

298
00:12:13,882 --> 00:12:15,438
Maybe we could meet
your friends there.

299
00:12:15,507 --> 00:12:17,626
I don't want my
mommy to take me.

300
00:12:17,907 --> 00:12:20,024
Well, then, you're not going.

You can go to Houston
with your friends,

335
00:13:54,144 --> 00:13:56,379
but I want to meet
this girl first.

336
00:13:57,512 --> 00:13:59,112
That's very reasonable.

337
00:13:59,181 --> 00:14:00,271
Thank you.

338
00:14:00,409 --> 00:14:01,747
You're welcome.

339
00:14:01,980 --> 00:14:04,049
Now, can you please reach
the dryer sheets?

340
00:14:04,118 --> 00:14:06,685
I get vertigo on the step stool.

341
00:14:08,060 --> 00:14:09,632
I've often been accused

342
00:14:09,701 --> 00:14:11,466
of being stubborn and willful,

343
00:14:11,535 --> 00:14:14,371
but sometimes
it works like gangbusters.

344
00:14:18,013 --> 00:14:19,108
Please come in.

345
00:14:19,177 --> 00:14:20,505
Have a seat.

346
00:14:21,144 --> 00:14:22,405
You have a
beautiful home.

347
00:14:22,474 --> 00:14:23,981
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

348
00:14:25,661 --> 00:14:28,177
I hope you'll forgive me,
I just wanted to meet

349
00:14:28,286 --> 00:14:31,030
the person driving
my nine-year-old son to Houston.

350
00:14:31,099 --> 00:14:32,910
- I understand.
- Me, too.

351
00:14:32,979 --> 00:14:34,755
I wasn't talking to you, Tam.

352
00:14:35,893 --> 00:14:37,795
And I just wanted
to make certain

353
00:14:37,864 --> 00:14:39,483
that you've had
no traffic tickets

354
00:14:39,552 --> 00:14:41,427
or, heaven forbid, accidents.

355
00:14:41,496 --> 00:14:43,543
No, ma'am.
I'm a very safe driver.

356
00:14:43,645 --> 00:14:45,621
- You've got nothing to worry about.
- Good.

357
00:14:45,937 --> 00:14:48,754
Good. Have you made
this trip before?

358
00:14:48,840 --> 00:14:50,708
- A few times, yes.
- Mm-hmm.

359
00:14:50,854 --> 00:14:53,275
Mm-hmm.
You smoke marijuana?

360
00:14:53,402 --> 00:14:55,312
Mom!
No, ma'am.

361
00:14:55,480 --> 00:14:56,887
Just say no.

362
00:14:59,973 --> 00:15:01,356
Well...

363
00:15:01,425 --> 00:15:03,144
I find this very reassuring.

364
00:15:03,213 --> 00:15:04,238
I have to admit,

365
00:15:04,307 --> 00:15:06,145
I had some trepidation, but...

366
00:15:06,535 --> 00:15:09,482
having met you,
I'm feeling a lot better.

367
00:15:09,551 --> 00:15:12,341
Good. You've got nothing
to worry about, Mrs. Cooper.

368
00:15:12,410 --> 00:15:14,606
I've been babysitting kids
for years.

369
00:15:14,824 --> 00:15:16,816
Babysitting... babysitting...

370
00:15:16,887 --> 00:15:19,434
Babysitting.

371
00:15:19,503 --> 00:15:23,801
Babysitting... babysitting... I've
been babysitting kids for years.

372
00:15:23,902 --> 00:15:25,262
Excuse me.

373
00:15:26,116 --> 00:15:27,217
I don't feel well.

374
00:15:27,285 --> 00:15:28,715
They'll have to go without me.

375
00:15:31,345 --> 00:15:33,669
♪♪

376
00:15:36,926 --> 00:15:38,088
Shelly,

377
00:15:38,155 --> 00:15:39,668
you okay?

378
00:15:40,543 --> 00:15:41,826
No.

379
00:15:42,010 --> 00:15:43,590
You want to talk about it?

380
00:15:44,347 --> 00:15:45,660
No.

381
00:15:45,973 --> 00:15:47,941
You want me to leave you alone?

382
00:15:48,977 --> 00:15:50,715
No.

383
00:15:54,305 --> 00:15:56,543
I thought Libby and I
were equals,

384
00:15:56,613 --> 00:15:58,934
but she thinks of me as a child.

385
00:15:59,090 --> 00:16:00,809
I'm sorry, baby.

386
00:16:00,973 --> 00:16:03,247
Calling me that
isn't helping right now.

387
00:16:03,314 --> 00:16:05,004
Right. Sorry.

388
00:16:05,434 --> 00:16:07,646
She is almost twice your age.

389
00:16:07,715 --> 00:16:09,708
There are people
five times my age

390
00:16:09,777 --> 00:16:11,388
that are stupider than me.

391
00:16:11,455 --> 00:16:13,357
This is not about being smart.

392
00:16:13,707 --> 00:16:15,879
- What else is there?
- Well...

393
00:16:16,004 --> 00:16:18,176
there's other kinds of maturity.

394
00:16:18,393 --> 00:16:19,660
What's up?

395
00:16:20,074 --> 00:16:21,527
None of your business.

396
00:16:21,668 --> 00:16:22,958
Why is he crying?

397
00:16:23,027 --> 00:16:24,840
Again, it's none
of your business.

398
00:16:24,909 --> 00:16:25,943
Please go.

399
00:16:26,012 --> 00:16:29,246
Fine. Celeste and I know
when we aren't wanted.

400
00:16:31,645 --> 00:16:32,890
Where were we?

401
00:16:32,981 --> 00:16:34,622
Different kinds of maturity.

402
00:16:34,691 --> 00:16:36,147
That's right.

403
00:16:37,512 --> 00:16:40,732
There's emotional maturity,
physical maturity,

404
00:16:40,801 --> 00:16:43,410
all things that have nothing
to do with being smart.

405
00:16:43,512 --> 00:16:46,168
Are you suggesting
I'm not emotionally mature?

406
00:16:46,262 --> 00:16:48,020
I was hinting at it.

407
00:16:48,419 --> 00:16:52,215
Regardless, I'm not interested
in making any more friends.

408
00:16:52,301 --> 00:16:54,910
Oh, I don't think
that's how you really feel.

409
00:16:54,979 --> 00:16:56,410
It is.

410
00:16:56,777 --> 00:16:59,824
From now on,
it's a hermit's life for me.

411
00:16:59,973 --> 00:17:02,637
I bet, when you grow up,
you will be surrounded

412
00:17:02,715 --> 00:17:07,077
by lots of smart,
wonderful friends.

413
00:17:07,926 --> 00:17:09,572
I can't see that happening.

414
00:17:09,769 --> 00:17:10,949
Well,

415
00:17:11,145 --> 00:17:13,816
the Lord works
in mysterious ways.

416
00:17:13,981 --> 00:17:16,223
And here we go
with the God talk.

417
00:17:25,562 --> 00:17:26,830
Hey.

418
00:17:27,163 --> 00:17:28,253
Hey.

419
00:17:28,327 --> 00:17:30,139
How was the IMAX movie?

420
00:17:31,085 --> 00:17:32,538
Well...

421
00:17:33,639 --> 00:17:35,139
<i>Okay, status. Find them?</i>

422
00:17:35,548 --> 00:17:37,296
<i>Go.
Guidance...</i>

423
00:17:40,233 --> 00:17:41,546
What are you doing?

424
00:17:42,942 --> 00:17:44,502
What do
you think I'm doing?

425
00:17:44,593 --> 00:17:47,151
Move your arm
before I rip it off.

426
00:17:49,327 --> 00:17:51,061
It got a little uncomfortable.

427
00:17:51,310 --> 00:17:52,585
Why is that?

428
00:17:52,889 --> 00:17:54,600
Libby's got feelings for me,

429
00:17:54,796 --> 00:17:56,866
but I think it's better
we just stay friends.

430
00:17:57,311 --> 00:17:59,772
I've been giving
geology some more thought.

431
00:17:59,841 --> 00:18:01,155
Yeah, and?

432
00:18:01,224 --> 00:18:03,913
I've decided
it's not really a science.

433
00:18:03,983 --> 00:18:06,457
- It's not?
- No, it's more like a hobby.

434
00:18:06,603 --> 00:18:07,914
Rock collecting.

435
00:18:07,983 --> 00:18:09,606
Childish, really.

436
00:18:09,913 --> 00:18:11,141
I can see that.

437
00:18:11,530 --> 00:18:12,742
<i>As you can see,</i>

438
00:18:12,809 --> 00:18:15,827
<i>sometimes a person can be

439
00:18:15,960 --> 00:18:17,678
