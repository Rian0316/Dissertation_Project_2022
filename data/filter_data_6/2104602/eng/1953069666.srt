00:00:00,988 --> 00:00:04,855
This is what you missed
last week on <i>Shameless.</i>

2
00:00:04,889 --> 00:00:06,391
My baby!

3
00:00:07,559 --> 00:00:08,491
True love.

4
00:00:08,526 --> 00:00:09,860
Hey, hot stuff.

5
00:00:09,895 --> 00:00:12,427
What do you do?
Real estate. I live in Miami.

6
00:00:13,996 --> 00:00:15,630
I kicked Lip out.
Where'd he go?

7
00:00:15,664 --> 00:00:17,098
Is it all right if
I stay over tonight?

8
00:00:17,136 --> 00:00:19,207
Was it weird seeing Jimmy?
Who's Jimmy?

9
00:00:19,242 --> 00:00:20,942
Jimmy is Steve.

10
00:00:20,977 --> 00:00:23,115
Holy shit. I'm gonna see
the little guy on Friday?

11
00:00:23,150 --> 00:00:24,220
Yep. For, like, a second.

12
00:00:25,522 --> 00:00:27,825
Christ almighty!
This cocksucker's killing me!

13
00:00:27,859 --> 00:00:29,395
When they're good, they're good.

14
00:00:29,429 --> 00:00:32,364
You're the only one
who truly understands me.

15
00:00:32,399 --> 00:00:35,238
Is something wrong with her?
She hasn't gotten out of bed in days.

16
00:00:35,273 --> 00:00:36,240
<i>Monica's bipolar, Debs.</i>

17
00:00:36,274 --> 00:00:38,376
Time for you to
go back on your meds, huh?

18
00:00:38,410 --> 00:00:40,681
- Holy fuck.
- What happened?

19
00:00:40,716 --> 00:00:42,918
Mommy, Mommy...
Oh, God, there's been an accident.

20
00:00:42,952 --> 00:00:44,921
She's bleeding badly. They're on their way.
You with me?

21
00:00:44,955 --> 00:00:46,559
It's gonna be okay. We're good,
we're good. Stay with me.

22
00:00:46,593 --> 00:00:47,927
How is she?
She's stable.

23
00:00:47,962 --> 00:00:49,262
You should go home.

24
00:00:49,296 --> 00:00:50,530
Lip just called.
He's coming?

25
00:00:50,565 --> 00:00:52,501
Karen's having a baby upstairs.
Holy fuck!

26
00:00:52,535 --> 00:00:54,271
It's coming, it's coming!

27
00:00:55,874 --> 00:00:57,742
What's wrong with him?

28
00:00:57,776 --> 00:01:00,382
He's has Downs Syndrome, Debs.
What the fuck, Karen?

29
00:01:00,416 --> 00:01:02,718
I never said it was your baby.

What the hell are you doing?

65
00:03:16,874 --> 00:03:19,576
You stole my wife!

66
00:03:19,610 --> 00:03:21,011
What?

67
00:03:21,045 --> 00:03:25,015
You stole my wife,
and I want her back.

68
00:03:25,049 --> 00:03:27,450
Okay, visiting hours
are 9:00 to 4:00.

69
00:03:27,485 --> 00:03:29,252
You want to see her,
come back then.

70
00:03:29,287 --> 00:03:31,087
Come out, Monica!
Hey!

71
00:03:31,122 --> 00:03:32,222
Get out of here.

72
00:03:32,256 --> 00:03:34,658
Monica, come home!

73
00:03:36,127 --> 00:03:38,463
I love you!

74
00:03:38,497 --> 00:03:42,634
I'll never leave you!

75
00:03:42,668 --> 00:03:45,404
Never...

76
00:03:56,318 --> 00:03:59,554
<i>You're an angel.</i>

77
00:03:59,588 --> 00:04:02,124
A blessing.

78
00:04:02,158 --> 00:04:04,293
My little Kung Pow blessing.

79
00:04:04,327 --> 00:04:08,798
Hmm. Gotta figure out how to
get this security thing off.

80
00:04:08,832 --> 00:04:11,969
What a big, beautiful,

81
00:04:12,003 --> 00:04:14,171
panda-Pooh Bear boy you are.

82
00:04:14,206 --> 00:04:16,474
Oh, look.

83
00:04:16,508 --> 00:04:18,609
He's still got his
little dingy-ding skin.

84
00:04:18,644 --> 00:04:20,445
Should we get him circumcised?

85
00:04:20,479 --> 00:04:22,614
Hell, no.
Let that extra derma ride.

86
00:04:22,648 --> 00:04:25,016
Oh, he needs a name.

87
00:04:25,050 --> 00:04:27,652
What about Hiram,
for my father?

88
00:04:27,687 --> 00:04:29,020
Are you a Hymmie?

89
00:04:29,055 --> 00:04:31,623
Hmm. Think they can track
this thing, like a baby LoJack?

90
00:04:31,657 --> 00:04:34,326
Are you a little Hymmie?

91
00:04:34,360 --> 00:04:36,695
A Hymmie-wymie?
The name should be something Chinese.

92
00:04:36,729 --> 00:04:39,130
Keep him connected to his people.
Hmm.

93
00:04:39,165 --> 00:04:40,865
Chinese...

94
00:04:40,899 --> 00:04:42,366
Chen, Chan,

95
00:04:42,400 --> 00:04:43,934
Chang...

96
00:04:43,968 --> 00:04:45,201
Wing? Wang?

97
00:04:45,236 --> 00:04:47,337
Wu?
Hm... it's pretty tight.

98
00:04:47,371 --> 00:04:48,972
I don't want to slip
and cut his leg off.

99
00:04:49,006 --> 00:04:51,207
Well, you could
clip his ankle bracelet

100
00:04:51,241 --> 00:04:52,708
and his foreskin
at the same time.

101
00:04:52,742 --> 00:04:54,876
Hey, my friend Cindy
went back to work.

102
00:04:54,911 --> 00:04:56,478
Has to pump.
For a five-spot,

103
00:04:56,512 --> 00:04:57,946
I bet she'd hook us up
with some breast milk.

104
00:04:57,981 --> 00:04:59,981
Oh...

105
00:05:12,928 --> 00:05:14,395
They're going to
be looking for him.

106
00:05:14,430 --> 00:05:16,631
We need to hide him.
How about the attic?

107
00:05:16,665 --> 00:05:18,199
Like that movie about
the Hebrew girl.

108
00:05:18,234 --> 00:05:20,735
No, it gets cold in the winter.
What about the basement?

109
00:05:20,769 --> 00:05:22,804
No, it's the first place
they'll look, sweetie.

110
00:05:24,073 --> 00:05:25,239
Dryer?

111
00:05:26,941 --> 00:05:29,242
Just can't forget he's in there.

112
00:05:29,277 --> 00:05:31,211
Right.

113
00:05:31,245 --> 00:05:33,713
Oh...

114
00:05:59,876 --> 00:06:02,243
I'll clear the table.

115
00:06:32,774 --> 00:06:35,276
Debs, bedtime.

116
00:07:30,067 --> 00:07:32,469
Fuck.

117
00:07:50,685 --> 00:07:53,053
Oh, Jesus.

118
00:07:53,087 --> 00:07:55,488
These poor kids.

119
00:08:00,594 --> 00:08:03,697
Don't worry, they're already
pretty fucked up.

120
00:08:03,731 --> 00:08:04,965
I mean...

121
00:08:50,210 --> 00:08:51,678
Ah...

122
00:08:51,712 --> 00:08:53,547
Okay, you can breathe.
Ah!

123
00:08:53,581 --> 00:08:55,516
Keep breathing.

124
00:09:46,103 --> 00:09:48,438

Hi.

Somebody stole the baby.

164
00:14:10,136 --> 00:14:12,438
They think it was my mom.

165
00:14:12,472 --> 00:14:15,041
Jesus.

167
00:14:16,944 --> 00:14:19,880

freaked out, like always.

I'm gonna get it back.

169

your mom keep him for awhile.

you're not gonna

I'm not gonna change my mind.

173
00:14:35,232 --> 00:14:37,399
Yeah, but you don't know that.
I mean, you could really...

174
00:14:37,434 --> 00:14:40,235
I don't want that fucking
thing anywhere near me, okay?

175
00:14:44,507 --> 00:14:48,075
Go ask somebody when I can
get the hell out of here.

176
00:14:48,109 --> 00:14:51,078
I want to hit Wendy's before
they stop serving breakfast.

177
00:15:10,266 --> 00:15:12,066
Morning.

178
00:15:12,101 --> 00:15:13,601
Kids still sleeping?

179
00:15:13,636 --> 00:15:15,003
Uh, yeah.

180
00:15:16,138 --> 00:15:17,305
Turkey and eggs?

181
00:15:17,339 --> 00:15:18,572
With mashed potato pancakes

182
00:15:18,607 --> 00:15:20,307
and cranberry jelly.
Hmm.

183
00:15:20,342 --> 00:15:23,244
You back to being a legal
resident around here, Steve?

184
00:15:23,278 --> 00:15:24,778
Jimmy. His name's
Jimmy now.

185
00:15:24,813 --> 00:15:26,247
Steve was just an alias he used

186
00:15:26,281 --> 00:15:28,115
to lie to me about
who he really was.

187
00:15:28,150 --> 00:15:29,750
Ooh, not cool, Jimmy-Steve.

188
00:15:29,784 --> 00:15:31,852
Eggs?
To go.

189
00:15:31,887 --> 00:15:33,287
I changed my name 'cause I was

190
00:15:33,321 --> 00:15:34,755
stealing cars.
Didn't want anyone to

191
00:15:34,789 --> 00:15:36,323
be able to track me down
if things went south.

192
00:15:36,357 --> 00:15:37,624
It didn't have anything
to do with you.

193
00:15:37,658 --> 00:15:39,526
Yeah.

194
00:15:43,365 --> 00:15:45,966
I want to meet your family.

195
00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:48,435
Oh, no, you don't.

196
00:15:48,469 --> 00:15:49,836
Yes, I do.

197
00:15:49,870 --> 00:15:51,371
They're miserable people.

198
00:15:51,405 --> 00:15:53,506
Nasty, egomaniacal
shit-heads.

199
00:15:53,540 --> 00:15:55,341
All of them?
Yeah, Mom's okay

200
00:15:55,375 --> 00:15:57,309
when she's knocked back
enough Chardonnay.

201
00:15:57,344 --> 00:15:58,677
How many of you are there?

202
00:15:58,712 --> 00:16:01,113
Uh, Mom, Dad--
shit-head superstar.

203
00:16:01,147 --> 00:16:02,180
Older brother Chip--

204
00:16:02,215 --> 00:16:03,615
shit-head
superstar-in-training.

205
00:16:03,650 --> 00:16:04,850
Can't wait to meet them.

206
00:16:04,884 --> 00:16:08,119
You're going to
be disappointed.

207
00:16:08,153 --> 00:16:11,555
Wouldn't be the first time
someone's disappointed me.

208
00:16:13,425 --> 00:16:14,992
Okay.

209
00:16:30,110 --> 00:16:31,477
You look beautiful.

210
00:16:33,847 --> 00:16:35,681
Liar.

211
00:16:45,924 --> 00:16:48,893
So, you getting okay care here?

212
00:16:48,927 --> 00:16:50,227
Good drugs?

213
00:16:50,262 --> 00:16:52,496
You need anything?

214
00:16:52,531 --> 00:16:57,767
Uh, cigarettes,
shampoo, hacksaw?

215
00:16:57,802 --> 00:16:59,435
Clothes.

216
00:16:59,470 --> 00:17:01,505
Mine are a mess.

217
00:17:01,539 --> 00:17:04,741
I'll bring by some stuff.

218
00:17:06,443 --> 00:17:10,112
I really screwed
up Thanksgiving.

219
00:17:10,146 --> 00:17:12,514
No, it was no big deal.

220
00:17:12,548 --> 00:17:14,215
The kids?

221
00:17:14,249 --> 00:17:16,684
I must have scared
the shit out of them.

222
00:17:16,719 --> 00:17:17,752
They're good.

223
00:17:17,786 --> 00:17:20,789
We, uh, talked
it out last night,

224
00:17:20,823 --> 00:17:23,692
and I tucked them in,
they're fine today.

225
00:17:23,726 --> 00:17:26,061
You didn't tuck them in.

226
00:17:26,095 --> 00:17:29,198
I read books to them,
the little ones, anyway.

227
00:17:29,232 --> 00:17:31,033
You'll be out soon.

228
00:17:31,067 --> 00:17:32,735
You'll see for yourself.

229
00:17:32,769 --> 00:17:34,570
Not soon.

230
00:17:34,604 --> 00:17:35,738
72 hours.

231
00:17:35,772 --> 00:17:38,674
You already got
15 under your belt.

232
00:17:40,610 --> 00:17:43,479
I signed myself in
for 60 more days.

233
00:17:43,513 --> 00:17:46,749
Voluntary commitment.

234
00:17:46,784 --> 00:17:48,751
Well, tell them
you changed your mind.

235
00:17:48,785 --> 00:17:49,986
I can't.

236
00:17:50,020 --> 00:17:53,322
That's part of the deal.

237
00:17:53,357 --> 00:17:58,328
Frank, I got to
get myself normal.

238
00:17:58,362 --> 00:18:00,763
I can't keep doing this to them.

239
00:18:02,533 --> 00:18:04,400
You're just a little blue.

240
00:18:04,434 --> 00:18:08,303
It happens to everyone
every now and again.

241
00:18:08,337 --> 00:18:11,506
I can take care of you at home.

242
00:18:15,778 --> 00:18:17,345
No, you can't.

243
00:18:17,380 --> 00:18:18,980
I love you.

244
00:18:19,015 --> 00:18:20,982
You belong with us.

245
00:18:34,062 --> 00:18:36,697
I'm...

246
00:18:36,731 --> 00:18:41,136
I'm where I need to be, okay?

247
00:18:46,376 --> 00:18:47,877
I got to go.

248
00:18:50,481 --> 00:18:52,349
I got group.

249
00:19:05,197 --> 00:19:06,997
Can I borrow a cup of cocaine?

250
00:19:07,031 --> 00:19:09,199
All out.
Coffee?

251
00:19:09,234 --> 00:19:12,335
How are the little
ones this morning?

252
00:19:12,370 --> 00:19:14,337
After seeing their mother
slit her wrists?

253
00:19:14,371 --> 00:19:16,139
Traumatized.

254
00:19:16,173 --> 00:19:19,377
Has to be support groups for
kids who've seen shit like that.

255
00:19:19,411 --> 00:19:21,479
Yeah, in maximum
security prisons

256
00:19:21,513 --> 00:19:23,348
after they've mowed down
half their classmates.

257
00:19:24,951 --> 00:19:27,519
You let Steve spend the night?

258
00:19:27,554 --> 00:19:29,889
You mean Jimmy?

259
00:19:29,923 --> 00:19:31,758
Fuck that, I'm
calling him Steve.

260
00:19:31,792 --> 00:19:33,393
I sent him out on a quest.

261
00:19:33,428 --> 00:19:36,596
Mm! Making him re-win
the heart of the virgin?

262
00:19:37,765 --> 00:19:39,065
Christ, V,

263
00:19:39,100 --> 00:19:40,834
I can't let him
back into this madness.

264
00:19:40,868 --> 00:19:42,435
Isn't that his choice?

265
00:19:42,470 --> 00:19:44,104
Well, he thinks
he wants it now,

266
00:19:44,138 --> 00:19:45,905
but just wait a year or two.

267
00:19:45,940 --> 00:19:48,508
When I have one in the oven
and Frank throws up in our bed

268
00:19:48,542 --> 00:19:49,943
in the middle of the
night or Monica tries

269
00:19:49,977 --> 00:19:52,846
to hang herself in a closet
with an old shoelace.

270
00:19:52,880 --> 00:19:54,948
He's a big boy, he can
make his own decisions.

271
00:19:54,982 --> 00:19:57,083
Hey, Carl.

272
00:19:57,117 --> 00:19:59,452
Sleep okay?

273
00:19:59,487 --> 00:20:01,655
What do you think?

274
00:20:05,494 --> 00:20:07,228
You hungry?

275
00:20:07,262 --> 00:20:10,064
- Let me make you a sandwich.
- Okay.

276
00:20:12,567 --> 00:20:13,768
Disability check

277
00:20:13,802 --> 00:20:15,570
doesn't come
for another week, Frank.

278
00:20:15,604 --> 00:20:17,772
I went to visit your mother
in the hospital this morning.

279
00:20:17,806 --> 00:20:19,407
We have to get
her out of there.

280
00:20:19,441 --> 00:20:20,742
Best place for her.

281
00:20:20,776 --> 00:20:22,710
She's fragile.
She's broken.

282
00:20:22,744 --> 00:20:24,479
They want to make her normal.

283
00:20:24,513 --> 00:20:26,047
They want to help her.

284
00:20:26,082 --> 00:20:28,983
By which they mean average,
boring, medicated,

285
00:20:29,018 --> 00:20:30,419
a Stepford Monica.

286
00:20:30,453 --> 00:20:32,120
She tried to kill herself
last night;

287
00:20:32,154 --> 00:20:33,455
boring would be a blessing.

288
00:20:33,489 --> 00:20:35,224
They perform lobotomies now.

289
00:20:35,258 --> 00:20:36,258
No, they don't.

290
00:20:36,292 --> 00:20:38,160
Shock treatment?
No.

291
00:20:38,194 --> 00:20:40,262
Actually, I think they do.
Princess Leia did it.

292
00:20:40,296 --> 00:20:42,898
100,000 volts of electricity

293
00:20:42,932 --> 00:20:44,800
zapped into her skull!

294
00:20:44,834 --> 00:20:48,804
Draws so much power,
it takes out entire city blocks.

295
00:20:48,838 --> 00:20:50,239
When our lights dim,
some poor fucker's

296
00:20:50,273 --> 00:20:51,440
getting his brains fried.

297
00:20:51,474 --> 00:20:52,574
Don't listen to him, Carl.

298
00:20:52,609 --> 00:20:53,575
Eat your breakfast.

299
00:20:53,610 --> 00:20:54,910
What's a lobotomy?

300
00:20:54,944 --> 00:20:56,145
They jam a screwdriver

301
00:20:56,179 --> 00:20:57,913
into your head
and scramble your brains.

302
00:20:57,947 --> 00:20:59,816
No, they don't. Jesus, Frank.

303
00:20:59,850 --> 00:21:01,517
Yeah, they do!
They're gonna put Mom

304
00:21:01,551 --> 00:21:02,918
back on her me.
They're gonna make her better.

305
00:21:02,953 --> 00:21:04,954
She's not better on her meds.

306
00:21:04,988 --> 00:21:07,958
She's a zombie. She gives up
everything she loves in life.

307
00:21:07,992 --> 00:21:10,928
Yeah, like what?
Drugs, alcohol, you?

308
00:21:10,962 --> 00:21:12,363
Us.

309
00:21:17,069 --> 00:21:19,170
I'm gonna bust her out of there

310
00:21:19,204 --> 00:21:20,838
before they steal what
makes Monica Monica.

311
00:21:20,872 --> 00:21:21,839
Are you with me?

312
00:21:21,874 --> 00:21:23,041
Leave her alone, Frank.

313
00:21:23,075 --> 00:21:25,543
She needs a chance to get well.

314
00:21:25,578 --> 00:21:26,945
Somebody can steal
what makes you you?

315
00:21:26,979 --> 00:21:28,680
No.
Carl?

316
00:21:28,714 --> 00:21:30,215
He's not helping you, either.

317
00:21:30,249 --> 00:21:31,816
Can I bring my Mac-10 pistol?

318
00:21:31,851 --> 00:21:33,518
Leave him out of this.
The pistol's going back

319
00:21:33,552 --> 00:21:34,953
to the cops.
Where's your sister?

320
00:21:34,987 --> 00:21:37,188
Shower.

321
00:21:37,223 --> 00:21:39,191
Leave Debbie alone, Frank!
No.

322
00:21:41,061 --> 00:21:43,496
Monica will be better when she
comes out of the hospital, Carl.

323
00:21:43,530 --> 00:21:46,699
I passed.

324
00:21:46,734 --> 00:21:48,735
The GED-- I passed.

325
00:21:54,209 --> 00:21:56,210
Daddy!

326
00:21:56,244 --> 00:21:58,479
Daddy, you're
supposed to knock!

327
00:21:58,513 --> 00:22:01,014
Do you love your mother?

328
00:22:01,049 --> 00:22:03,684
Cindy says they make this thing
for women who can't produce

329
00:22:03,718 --> 00:22:05,252
their own milk.

330
00:22:05,287 --> 00:22:07,921
You hang this doohickey
around your neck,

331
00:22:07,956 --> 00:22:13,894
and then you tape these
right over

332
00:22:13,928 --> 00:22:15,162
your nipples.

333
00:22:15,196 --> 00:22:17,565
And the baby
can still breast-feed.

334
00:22:17,599 --> 00:22:20,267
It's okay, honey,
I-I can do it.

335
00:22:20,302 --> 00:22:23,204
No, it's important
for both of us to bond with him.

336
00:22:25,240 --> 00:22:27,275
Okay.

337
00:22:27,309 --> 00:22:29,310
Okay.

338
00:22:31,047 --> 00:22:33,348
There, sweet boy.

339
00:22:36,986 --> 00:22:38,353
Whoa.

340
00:22:38,387 --> 00:22:39,687
Wow.

341
00:22:39,721 --> 00:22:41,255
That's... Whoa.

342
00:22:41,289 --> 00:22:42,523
Whoa!

343
00:22:43,825 --> 00:22:45,559
Now I know what
all the fuss is about.

344
00:22:47,728 --> 00:22:49,696
Someone's here.
Oh.

345
00:22:51,832 --> 00:22:53,065
Mom?

346
00:22:54,467 --> 00:22:56,368
Mom.

347
00:22:56,403 --> 00:22:59,038
Sweetie!

348
00:22:59,072 --> 00:23:01,107
My goodness! Home already?

349
00:23:01,141 --> 00:23:04,043
Did the hospital let you leave?

350
00:23:04,078 --> 00:23:05,278
Where is it?

351
00:23:05,313 --> 00:23:06,880
Thought they usually
like to keep you

352
00:23:06,915 --> 00:23:09,116
for at least a day.
Where is it, Mom?

353
00:23:09,150 --> 00:23:10,951
Where's what, honey?

354
00:23:10,986 --> 00:23:12,587
It.

355
00:23:12,621 --> 00:23:14,289
The baby that shoved
its ginormous head

356
00:23:14,323 --> 00:23:16,892
out of my cooter for six
endless hours last night.

357
00:23:16,926 --> 00:23:19,260
Oh, my. Did they lose it?

358
00:23:19,295 --> 00:23:22,730
They showed me the video footage
of you taking it.

359
00:23:25,334 --> 00:23:27,268
Oh, that baby.
They were gonna call

360
00:23:27,302 --> 00:23:29,069
the police, but I said no.

361
00:23:30,338 --> 00:23:31,972
Where is it?

362
00:23:34,176 --> 00:23:35,877
Now, Mom!
In the dryer.

363
00:23:43,153 --> 00:23:45,121
Take it out.

364
00:23:45,155 --> 00:23:46,355
I think he's napping.

365
00:23:46,390 --> 00:23:47,624
Take it out!

366
00:23:47,658 --> 00:23:48,992
I don't want to touch it!

367
00:23:51,162 --> 00:23:53,196
You're leaking.

368
00:23:58,536 --> 00:24:00,637
Isn't he beautiful?

369
00:24:00,671 --> 00:24:02,038
Take it back to the hospital.

370
00:24:02,072 --> 00:24:03,506
Somebody will want it.

371
00:24:03,541 --> 00:24:05,375
I want it.

372
00:24:05,409 --> 00:24:06,709
Well, you can't have it.

373
00:24:06,744 --> 00:24:09,646
He's such a sweet boy.

374
00:24:09,680 --> 00:24:12,215
He never cries.

375
00:24:12,249 --> 00:24:14,150
He's so handsome.

376
00:24:14,185 --> 00:24:16,152
We want to name him Hiram

377
00:24:16,186 --> 00:24:17,887
after your grandfather.

378
00:24:17,921 --> 00:24:20,689
Or maybe Ming, to keep him
wired into his Chinese-ness.

379
00:24:20,724 --> 00:24:23,159
Shut up, Jody.

380
00:24:23,193 --> 00:24:25,227
It's going back.

381
00:24:25,262 --> 00:24:28,297
Karen, please don't do this.

382
00:24:28,331 --> 00:24:31,300
They'll give it to the retarded
freaks' home or whatever.

383
00:24:31,334 --> 00:24:33,335
He's my grandson.

384
00:24:33,370 --> 00:24:36,705
I won't let you throw him away

385
00:24:36,740 --> 00:24:38,841
like used Kleenex.

386
00:24:38,875 --> 00:24:40,543
You know, Karen, your
mom might be right.

387
00:24:40,577 --> 00:24:42,311
Maybe she should keep
him for a while.

388
00:24:42,346 --> 00:24:43,846
You know, who knows

389
00:24:43,881 --> 00:24:45,882
what social services is
going to do with him?

390
00:24:45,916 --> 00:24:47,317
Butt out, Lip!

391
00:24:47,351 --> 00:24:48,551
What are you even doing here?

392
00:24:48,586 --> 00:24:49,819
He's not even yours.

393
00:24:49,853 --> 00:24:51,554
This is none of your
goddamn business.

394
00:24:51,589 --> 00:24:53,489
At least call Tim Wong
or whoever the father is

395
00:24:53,524 --> 00:24:54,724
and tell him about it.

396
00:24:54,758 --> 00:24:56,826
Get out!

397
00:25:02,132 --> 00:25:03,833
You dodged a fucking RPG

398
00:25:03,868 --> 00:25:06,103
getting tossed over
by this one.

399
00:25:06,137 --> 00:25:08,371
Don't I know it, man.

400
00:25:08,405 --> 00:25:11,074
Take it back to the hospital.

401
00:25:11,108 --> 00:25:12,675
What if they won't
take it back?

402
00:25:12,710 --> 00:25:14,077
Then drop it in a basket

403
00:25:14,111 --> 00:25:15,344
and leave it at
the fire station.

404
00:25:15,378 --> 00:25:16,579
I don't give a shit.

405
00:25:16,613 --> 00:25:18,514
No.

406
00:25:18,548 --> 00:25:20,949
No.

407
00:25:20,983 --> 00:25:22,450
Yes!

408
00:25:22,484 --> 00:25:25,553
He is staying with me.

409
00:25:26,989 --> 00:25:28,989
Fine!

410
00:25:30,225 --> 00:25:32,626
Then I'm calling the police.

411
00:25:58,285 --> 00:26:00,486
Lip here?

412
00:26:00,520 --> 00:26:02,121
Lip!

413
00:26:12,200 --> 00:26:14,202
It's your sister.

414
00:26:19,474 --> 00:26:21,475
So...

415
00:26:24,045 --> 00:26:25,979
How'd you find me?

416
00:26:26,013 --> 00:26:28,281
Jimmy.

417
00:26:32,319 --> 00:26:34,420
How's Karen?

418
00:26:34,455 --> 00:26:35,855
Girl's a fucking bitch.

419
00:26:35,889 --> 00:26:37,524
My cousin, Eli, was born

420
00:26:37,558 --> 00:26:39,259
with a foot coming out
of his knee.

421
00:26:39,293 --> 00:26:40,527
Now he's a blacksmith.

422
00:26:40,562 --> 00:26:42,596
Only one who can
pump the bellows

423
00:26:42,631 --> 00:26:44,599
without using his hands.

424
00:26:47,203 --> 00:26:48,971
I passed my GED.

425
00:26:51,207 --> 00:26:53,309
Don't look so surprised.

426
00:26:53,344 --> 00:26:54,844
No, I'm not.

427
00:26:54,878 --> 00:26:57,580
That's, um...
that's great.

428
00:27:02,720 --> 00:27:05,688
So... deal's a deal.

429
00:27:05,722 --> 00:27:07,156
Ah, too late.

430
00:27:07,190 --> 00:27:09,158
Spilt milk.
I passed.

431
00:27:09,192 --> 00:27:11,326
You go back to school.
Water under the bridge.

432
00:27:11,360 --> 00:27:13,294
Knock off the clichés.

433
00:27:13,329 --> 00:27:15,930
Road not taken.

434
00:27:20,336 --> 00:27:22,737
I want you home, Lip.

435
00:27:22,771 --> 00:27:25,206
We all do.

436
00:27:34,349 --> 00:27:36,517
Right.

437
00:27:52,098 --> 00:27:55,233
It's cold water and
sleep deprivation.

438
00:27:55,268 --> 00:27:56,601
Make you stand all day

439
00:27:56,636 --> 00:27:58,670
with electrodes tied
to your genitals.

440
00:27:58,704 --> 00:28:01,239
I think you're mistaking
Cook County for Abi Grabie.

441
00:28:01,274 --> 00:28:03,108
Abu Gradie.
Abu Ghraib.

442
00:28:03,142 --> 00:28:05,578
Did a tour with the
Guard-- Basra.

443
00:28:05,613 --> 00:28:07,413
They don't do any
of that, Frank.

444
00:28:07,448 --> 00:28:08,715
I was in there last year

445
00:28:08,749 --> 00:28:10,350
after my accidental overdose.

446
00:28:10,385 --> 00:28:12,753
Accidental? You set yourself
on fire freebasing.

447
00:28:12,787 --> 00:28:15,689
It was mostly us
sitting in a circle

448
00:28:15,724 --> 00:28:18,693
in a group talking
about how your family

449
00:28:18,727 --> 00:28:20,394
- screwed you up.
- Oh, Monica talking about Frank?

450
00:28:20,429 --> 00:28:21,629
That ought to take a while.

451
00:28:23,165 --> 00:28:25,132
Frank, you got any cash?

452
00:28:25,166 --> 00:28:27,301
Moolah? Green?

453
00:28:27,335 --> 00:28:29,736
I got to spring her
out of there.

454
00:28:29,770 --> 00:28:31,771
She's the yin to my yang.

455
00:28:31,805 --> 00:28:33,406
She's the scotch in my soda.

456
00:28:33,440 --> 00:28:35,908
We are Fred and Ginger.

457
00:28:35,943 --> 00:28:38,744
John and Yoko.
Mickey and Minnie.

458
00:28:38,778 --> 00:28:39,979
More like Siegfried and Roy.

459
00:28:40,013 --> 00:28:41,514
Adolf and Eva.

460
00:28:45,353 --> 00:28:47,954
Your boy still working nights
at the hospital, Tommy?

461
00:28:47,989 --> 00:28:50,324
Support services
technician, yeah.

462
00:28:50,359 --> 00:28:52,626
Support services technician?
I thought he was a janitor.

463
00:28:52,661 --> 00:28:53,961
A job's a job.

464
00:28:53,995 --> 00:28:55,463
At least Pat's got one.

465
00:28:55,497 --> 00:28:57,098
What time's Patty go to work?

466
00:28:59,969 --> 00:29:01,970
We're on for tonight.

467
00:29:02,004 --> 00:29:04,139
What's tonight?
Dinner with my family.

468
00:29:04,173 --> 00:29:05,940
You asked, you got it.

469
00:29:05,975 --> 00:29:07,408
Are they coming here?

470
00:29:07,443 --> 00:29:09,276
Uh... no.

471
00:29:09,311 --> 00:29:11,178
Dad hasn't been south
of the Art Institute Gala

472
00:29:11,213 --> 00:29:13,948
since Billy Joel
played Comiskey Park in '84.

473
00:29:13,982 --> 00:29:16,450
Going to their house for dinner?
Nope.

474
00:29:16,485 --> 00:29:18,319
Uh, Mom would have
to have you deloused first.

475
00:29:18,353 --> 00:29:19,620
She's a germophobe.

476
00:29:19,655 --> 00:29:21,755
You want an almond
out of the serving dish,

477
00:29:21,790 --> 00:29:23,824
you have to wear
surgical gloves and use tongs.

478
00:29:23,859 --> 00:29:24,958
I met your mom.

479
00:29:24,993 --> 00:29:26,827
She's... she's cool.

480
00:29:26,861 --> 00:29:28,428
You met his mom?

481
00:29:28,463 --> 00:29:29,796
Candace.

482
00:29:29,831 --> 00:29:31,131
A little heavy on the Botox

483
00:29:31,166 --> 00:29:33,633
and Chanel No. 5,
but nice.

484
00:29:33,668 --> 00:29:35,002
So where are we meeting?

485
00:29:35,036 --> 00:29:36,270
Uh, Morton's, downtown.

486
00:29:36,304 --> 00:29:37,672
Dad has a wine locker there.

487
00:29:37,706 --> 00:29:38,940
Little brass plaque

488
00:29:38,974 --> 00:29:40,775
with his name on
it and everything.

489
00:29:40,809 --> 00:29:42,443
Everybody invited?
Yep. Dad's buying,

490
00:29:42,477 --> 00:29:43,678
so order the most
expensive thing

491
00:29:43,712 --> 00:29:44,979
on the menu.
Prime rib?

492
00:29:45,013 --> 00:29:47,683
Sure.
Bone-in porterhouse steak?

493
00:29:47,717 --> 00:29:49,484
Anything you want. What do
you say, Debs, free meal?

494
00:29:49,518 --> 00:29:51,152
No can do, Jim. Busy.

495
00:29:51,186 --> 00:29:54,489
Doing what?
Sleeping over at Holly Herkimier's.

496
00:29:55,558 --> 00:29:58,226
Don't do anything she does.

497
00:29:58,261 --> 00:29:59,694
Big-ass lobster?

498
00:29:59,729 --> 00:30:01,830
You bet.

499
00:30:18,212 --> 00:30:21,148
♪ Bad, bad heart ♪

500
00:30:21,183 --> 00:30:24,686

Jesus Christ!

505
00:30:35,365 --> 00:30:39,101
Don't you ever hose
these things out?

506
00:30:39,135 --> 00:30:41,370
Smells worse than
a dead hooker's ass in there.

507
00:30:41,404 --> 00:30:44,106
Keep your voice
down, all right?

508
00:30:44,140 --> 00:30:45,440
Easy, cowboy.

509
00:30:45,474 --> 00:30:47,375
That orange one's
for experts only.

510
00:30:47,409 --> 00:30:49,043
Hey, you do get caught,

511
00:30:49,078 --> 00:30:50,578
you never heard
of me, all right?

512
00:30:53,215 --> 00:30:54,548
Doing good in there, pumpkin?

513
00:30:54,583 --> 00:30:56,550
Mm-hmm.
A-okay, Daddy.

514
00:31:02,290 --> 00:31:04,525
Cops!
Aah!

515
00:31:04,560 --> 00:31:06,428
Come on, Mom. Hurry up.
Okay.

516
00:31:06,462 --> 00:31:07,762
I'm hurrying. Okay!
Mom, come on!

517
00:31:11,301 --> 00:31:13,769
Police are here, Mom.

518
00:31:19,910 --> 00:31:21,110
Hello, Mrs. Jackson.

519
00:31:21,145 --> 00:31:22,578
Hey.

520
00:31:22,613 --> 00:31:25,281
Tony. How's your mom?

521
00:31:25,315 --> 00:31:28,251
The diabetes still giving her fits?
Yes, ma'am.

522
00:31:28,286 --> 00:31:31,121
Lost two toes over the summer,
but she's hanging tough.

523
00:31:31,155 --> 00:31:32,823
Well, she'd
have to be--

524
00:31:32,857 --> 00:31:35,792
all those years skating
with the Ice Capades.

525
00:31:37,829 --> 00:31:41,832
Uh... we got a call
about a kidnapping.

526
00:31:41,866 --> 00:31:43,667
Oh...
Mom and Jody

527
00:31:43,702 --> 00:31:46,337
stole my baby from
the hospital.

528
00:31:46,371 --> 00:31:48,573
You had your baby?

529
00:31:48,607 --> 00:31:50,341
Congratulations.

530
00:31:50,375 --> 00:31:52,643
Thanks. It was a fucking
horror show, but I...

531
00:31:52,678 --> 00:31:54,813
finally had the damn thing.

532
00:31:54,847 --> 00:31:57,850
They stole it, and I want
you to take it back.

533
00:31:57,884 --> 00:32:01,787
You don't... want
to keep the baby?

534
00:32:01,821 --> 00:32:03,422
It's retarded.

535
00:32:03,457 --> 00:32:06,025
I want it to go back
so they can give it away

536
00:32:06,059 --> 00:32:08,127
to the Down Syndrome
baby do-gooders

537
00:32:08,161 --> 00:32:10,029
or the county or whatever.

538
00:32:10,063 --> 00:32:12,131
Correct term for Downs kids

539
00:32:12,166 --> 00:32:13,866
is "developmentally
delayed."

540
00:32:13,900 --> 00:32:17,803
Well, my baby was
stolen by my mom

541
00:32:17,838 --> 00:32:19,372
and her developmentally
delayed boyfriend.

542
00:32:19,406 --> 00:32:21,640
He's not my boyfriend.
I'm not?

543
00:32:21,675 --> 00:32:23,309
Uh, Mrs. Jackson,

544
00:32:23,343 --> 00:32:27,513
did you take
your daughter's baby?

545
00:32:27,548 --> 00:32:29,715
Baby? What baby?

546
00:32:33,754 --> 00:32:35,688
Ma'am, is the baby
in the laundry basket?

547
00:32:39,193 --> 00:32:41,328
Yes.

548
00:32:51,072 --> 00:32:53,007
Give it to the cop, Mom.

549
00:32:53,041 --> 00:32:54,708
Karen, honey, please
don't do this.

550
00:32:54,743 --> 00:32:55,976
Ah, man.

551
00:32:56,011 --> 00:32:58,245
Look how handsome you are.

552
00:32:58,279 --> 00:33:00,180
Yes, you are.
Yes, you are.

553
00:33:00,215 --> 00:33:02,550
Give it to the damn cop, Mom!

554
00:33:03,718 --> 00:33:05,920
So this is your mother,

555
00:33:05,954 --> 00:33:08,022
and she wants
to take care of the baby?

556
00:33:08,057 --> 00:33:09,424
Yes, but I don't

557
00:33:09,458 --> 00:33:11,659
want it here.
Oh.

558
00:33:11,694 --> 00:33:13,394
And you want a total stranger

559
00:33:13,429 --> 00:33:15,530
to take him or the
State of Illinois

560
00:33:15,564 --> 00:33:18,332
to be responsible for him

561
00:33:18,367 --> 00:33:19,734
on the taxpayers' dime?

562
00:33:22,539 --> 00:33:25,040
You hungry?

563
00:33:25,075 --> 00:33:26,642
I'm thinking Thai.

564
00:33:28,212 --> 00:33:29,446
Yeah.

565
00:33:29,480 --> 00:33:31,614
That's it?
You're just gonna leave?

566
00:33:31,649 --> 00:33:33,617
Nice seeing you, Mrs. Jackson.

567
00:33:33,652 --> 00:33:36,053
I'll tell Mom you asked after her.
Please.

568
00:33:40,258 --> 00:33:43,127
It's either me
or that baby, Mom.

569
00:33:43,161 --> 00:33:44,628
Your choice.

570
00:33:56,174 --> 00:33:58,609
I think this must be the place.

571
00:33:58,643 --> 00:34:00,144
Can I get out?
It's hot in here.

572
00:34:00,178 --> 00:34:01,279
No.
Ow!

573
00:34:14,328 --> 00:34:15,128
Monica?

574
00:34:16,997 --> 00:34:18,331
Monica?

575
00:34:18,365 --> 00:34:20,900
I can be if you want me to be.

576
00:34:24,170 --> 00:34:25,904
Jesus!

577
00:34:28,941 --> 00:34:30,141
Monica?

578
00:34:30,176 --> 00:34:31,943
Monica?

579
00:34:33,045 --> 00:34:34,679
Monica?

580
00:34:41,353 --> 00:34:42,353
Kermit?

581
00:34:42,388 --> 00:34:43,188
Frank?

582
00:34:43,222 --> 00:34:44,323
What'd you do to your head?

583
00:34:44,357 --> 00:34:47,026
Oh, um, my therapy.

584
00:34:47,060 --> 00:34:48,694
It calms my nerves.

585
00:34:48,729 --> 00:34:50,162
You let 'em zap your head?

586
00:34:50,197 --> 00:34:51,998
Helps with my seizures.

587
00:34:52,033 --> 00:34:53,333
Jesus.

588
00:34:53,367 --> 00:34:56,503
Try it before you knock it,
Frank. Very restful.

589
00:34:56,538 --> 00:34:58,105
Have you seen Monica around?

590
00:34:58,139 --> 00:35:00,140
Yeah, um...

591
00:35:00,174 --> 00:35:02,375
across the hall on your left.

592
00:35:15,421 --> 00:35:17,321
Monica?

593
00:35:18,257 --> 00:35:19,323
Monica?

594
00:35:21,394 --> 00:35:23,028
Hey, Monica?

595
00:35:24,364 --> 00:35:25,664
Frank.

596
00:35:25,699 --> 00:35:26,865
I came to get you out.

597
00:35:26,900 --> 00:35:30,569
I told you I don't want out.

598
00:35:30,604 --> 00:35:31,871
Why'd you stop?

599
00:35:35,075 --> 00:35:36,309
Did you come?

600
00:35:36,343 --> 00:35:38,711
Um...

601
00:35:38,746 --> 00:35:39,512
Frank,

602
00:35:39,546 --> 00:35:41,314
this is Jill.

603
00:35:41,348 --> 00:35:44,350
Jill this is my husband, Frank.

604
00:35:47,387 --> 00:35:48,587
Oops.

605
00:35:51,691 --> 00:35:52,924
Mom?

606
00:35:56,895 --> 00:35:58,763
Fiona! Fiona, look!

607
00:35:58,797 --> 00:36:00,865
Boys.

608
00:36:00,899 --> 00:36:01,566
Carl...

609
00:36:01,600 --> 00:36:02,567
Sorry. We don't let him out

610
00:36:02,601 --> 00:36:05,036
of his cage very often.
Carl!

611
00:36:05,070 --> 00:36:06,404
Get over here.

612
00:36:06,438 --> 00:36:08,339
So, Jim, what have
you been up to?

613
00:36:08,373 --> 00:36:09,773
Still finding new

614
00:36:09,807 --> 00:36:12,108
and creative ways
to underachieve?

615
00:36:12,143 --> 00:36:13,877
I was traveling around
South America till recently.

616
00:36:13,911 --> 00:36:16,947
Are you still handling all the
hemorrhoidectomies for Dad?

617
00:36:16,981 --> 00:36:20,251
Chip just joined Dad's practice
after his surgical residency,

618
00:36:20,285 --> 00:36:21,786
following in
the great man's footsteps.

619
00:36:21,820 --> 00:36:24,188
So you get to cut into people?

620
00:36:24,223 --> 00:36:25,523
Awesome.

621
00:36:27,793 --> 00:36:29,061
He take you skiing yet?

622
00:36:29,095 --> 00:36:30,362
Uh, no.

623
00:36:30,397 --> 00:36:32,431
My only talent involving snow
is knowing how

624
00:36:32,466 --> 00:36:35,735
to shovel the walk without
disturbing my father sleeping on it.

625
00:36:35,770 --> 00:36:38,805
And Carl's pretty good
at peeing in it as well.

626
00:36:38,839 --> 00:36:40,806
What was the name
of that girl that he took

627
00:36:40,841 --> 00:36:43,075
to St. Moritz
on New Year's? Chrissie?

628
00:36:43,109 --> 00:36:45,611
Lizzie? Something. I remember it
had "ie" on the end of it.

629
00:36:45,645 --> 00:36:46,812
I was 17.

630
00:36:46,846 --> 00:36:48,480
You took a girlfriend to Europe
in high school?

631
00:36:48,514 --> 00:36:49,815
Dad offered a ticket.

632
00:36:49,849 --> 00:36:51,816
He drags her all
the way to the Alps,

633
00:36:51,851 --> 00:36:55,053
then leaves her in
the hotel room sitting there

634
00:36:55,087 --> 00:36:57,489
for some French girl
he met on the gondola.

635
00:36:57,523 --> 00:36:58,823
Chip, leave your brother alone.

636
00:36:58,858 --> 00:37:00,591
Two things you can count on:

637
00:37:00,626 --> 00:37:02,160
Mom's naked favoritism
for her youngest...

638
00:37:02,194 --> 00:37:04,295
That's not true.

639
00:37:04,330 --> 00:37:06,098
My brother still thinks of me as
the runt that didn't punch back.

640
00:37:06,132 --> 00:37:08,767
...and her youngest's quick
and stealthy exit

641
00:37:08,801 --> 00:37:11,636
after he weasels her
out of another ten grand.

642
00:37:11,671 --> 00:37:14,306
I was hoping to milk her for
another 20 this time.

643
00:37:14,340 --> 00:37:16,842
With a name like Chip,
you'd think you'd want

644
00:37:16,876 --> 00:37:19,444
to defy the stereotype.

645
00:37:19,479 --> 00:37:20,445
Fiona, don't.
It's fine.

646
00:37:20,479 --> 00:37:21,646
No, it's not.

647
00:37:25,217 --> 00:37:27,486
Well, sorry to be late.

648
00:37:27,520 --> 00:37:31,023
Whipple on
a stage-four patient.

649
00:37:31,057 --> 00:37:33,425
So, you are
the mysterious Fiona.

650
00:37:33,459 --> 00:37:35,761
And these are
Fiona's brothers, Carl...

651
00:37:35,795 --> 00:37:37,529
and Ian...

652
00:37:40,333 --> 00:37:41,867
Well, nice to meet you, Ian.

653
00:37:41,902 --> 00:37:43,869
Have we ordered?

654
00:37:43,903 --> 00:37:46,138
Excuse me.

655
00:37:46,172 --> 00:37:48,173
Bathroom.

656
00:37:50,543 --> 00:37:51,543
And your drink, sir.
Thank you.

657
00:37:51,578 --> 00:37:54,780
Ah, you know,
I gotta wash my hands.

658
00:37:54,814 --> 00:37:58,817
I'll have the iceberg lettuce
salad and the sea bass.

659
00:37:58,851 --> 00:38:01,819
Double-cut,
48-ounce prime rib,

660
00:38:01,853 --> 00:38:03,854
medium-rare,

661
00:38:03,889 --> 00:38:06,523
and the two-pound
Maine lobster, please.

662
00:38:11,929 --> 00:38:14,564
Hey.

663
00:38:14,598 --> 00:38:16,867
Do they know you're gay?

664
00:38:16,901 --> 00:38:20,370
I'm not gay.

665
00:38:20,405 --> 00:38:23,174
Really?
What's this then?

666
00:38:24,743 --> 00:38:26,243
Honestly?

667
00:38:26,278 --> 00:38:28,346
Anything that walks, that's me.

668
00:38:29,915 --> 00:38:33,018
Jesus, Moni, another lady?

669
00:38:33,052 --> 00:38:37,256
You know,
I get lonely.

670
00:38:37,290 --> 00:38:38,490
Do you love her?

671
00:38:38,524 --> 00:38:39,758
I just met her.

672
00:38:39,792 --> 00:38:41,893
What are you doing here?

673
00:38:41,928 --> 00:38:43,561
We came to break you out.

674
00:38:43,595 --> 00:38:47,331
I told you, I don't want out.

675
00:38:47,365 --> 00:38:48,332
Oh, hell, I do.

676
00:38:48,366 --> 00:38:49,900
No one's offering, Jill.

677
00:38:49,934 --> 00:38:52,435
And why did you have to
drag Debbie into this?

678
00:38:52,470 --> 00:38:55,471
I didn't think you'd come
if it was just me.

679
00:38:58,976 --> 00:39:01,044
What is she in for?

680
00:39:01,078 --> 00:39:02,245
Psych evaluation to see

681
00:39:02,280 --> 00:39:03,547
if I'm competent
to stand trial.

682
00:39:03,581 --> 00:39:05,950
What'd you do?

683
00:39:05,984 --> 00:39:07,952
Shot my husband 26 times.

684
00:39:07,986 --> 00:39:09,954
Jesus, what'd you use, an AK?

685
00:39:09,989 --> 00:39:11,356
Pistol.

686
00:39:11,390 --> 00:39:14,860
I reloaded... twice.

687
00:39:22,102 --> 00:39:24,103
Moni, we want you with us.

688
00:39:25,739 --> 00:39:27,239
The kids need you.

689
00:39:27,274 --> 00:39:28,474
I need you.

690
00:39:29,509 --> 00:39:31,043
Does it hurt?

691
00:39:31,077 --> 00:39:33,812
No, I'm okay.

692
00:39:33,846 --> 00:39:38,082
I'm sorry you had
to see that, honey.

693
00:39:38,116 --> 00:39:42,320
I was just so low, you know?

694
00:39:42,355 --> 00:39:45,257
Mm-hmm, yeah.

695
00:39:45,291 --> 00:39:47,059
But I'm okay now.

696
00:39:47,093 --> 00:39:49,128
Mm-hmm.

697
00:39:54,936 --> 00:39:57,371
So...

698
00:39:59,174 --> 00:40:02,843
What's this grand plan you have
for busting us out?

699
00:40:08,184 --> 00:40:09,317
Got it.

700
00:40:18,495 --> 00:40:21,764
Whoa. That's short.

701
00:40:22,900 --> 00:40:24,300
That's a long way down.

702
00:40:24,335 --> 00:40:26,803
Could tie sheets to the end.

703
00:40:26,837 --> 00:40:28,337
What?!

704
00:40:28,372 --> 00:40:30,206
Hey, it's only two stories down
to the roof...

705
00:40:30,240 --> 00:40:31,874
outside the ladies' john.

706
00:40:37,247 --> 00:40:38,881
You want me to go pick up Liam?

707
00:40:38,915 --> 00:40:41,183
Uh, V will be okay keeping him
overnight.

708
00:40:41,218 --> 00:40:43,052
Great restaurant,
Jimmy. Check out

709
00:40:43,086 --> 00:40:44,186
this cool knife I stole.

710
00:40:44,220 --> 00:40:45,721
That's going back.

711
00:40:45,755 --> 00:40:48,690
Hey, they won't miss it.
They got tons of 'em.

712
00:40:50,159 --> 00:40:52,527
Give me that.
Bed, now.

713
00:40:52,561 --> 00:40:55,397
Hey, nobody touch
my leftover lobster.

714
00:40:55,431 --> 00:40:58,766
I want to put it in my cinnamon
toaster waffle in the morning.

715
00:41:04,106 --> 00:41:06,374
Hey, Fiona.

716
00:41:06,409 --> 00:41:07,642
Hmm?

717
00:41:07,677 --> 00:41:09,378
Jimmy's dad Lloyd,

718
00:41:09,412 --> 00:41:11,581
he, uh..

719
00:41:11,615 --> 00:41:12,982
Good night.

720
00:41:15,886 --> 00:41:16,886
Night.

721
00:41:42,944 --> 00:41:44,945
What?

722
00:41:44,979 --> 00:41:47,247
I love you.

723
00:41:54,088 --> 00:41:56,356
Are you gonna leave?

724
00:41:58,493 --> 00:42:00,995
No.

725
00:42:02,965 --> 00:42:06,134
Everybody always leaves.

726
00:42:06,168 --> 00:42:08,136
I won't.

727
00:42:44,940 --> 00:42:47,242
Patience...

728
00:42:47,276 --> 00:42:49,745
Stop that!

729
00:42:52,482 --> 00:42:54,183
Steve!

730
00:42:56,153 --> 00:42:57,186
Steve!

731
00:42:58,822 --> 00:43:00,422
Estefania...

732
00:43:00,457 --> 00:43:01,857
Jesus!

733
00:43:01,892 --> 00:43:03,992
Hey, hey, hey, Estefania.
What is it?

734
00:43:04,027 --> 00:43:07,362
Estefania, hey,
calm down, calm down.

735
00:43:07,397 --> 00:43:08,930
What the hell happened?

736
00:43:10,632 --> 00:43:13,667
Hey...
Marco...

737
00:43:15,170 --> 00:43:17,037
Wait. Marco did this to you?
He hit you?

738
00:43:17,071 --> 00:43:18,105
Did Marco hit you?

739
00:43:20,408 --> 00:43:21,508
You my husband...

740
00:43:21,543 --> 00:43:24,211
Help me, please?

741
00:43:24,246 --> 00:43:26,180
Please help me!

742
00:43:30,152 --> 00:43:32,254
Please?

743
00:43:52,541 --> 00:43:54,508
What are you doing?

744
00:43:54,542 --> 00:43:58,912
Uh, I couldn't sleep.
Needed a smoke.

745
00:43:58,946 --> 00:44:00,814
You don't have
to do it out here.

746
00:44:00,848 --> 00:44:02,849
With Dad home,
the whole house is an ashtray.

747
00:44:06,387 --> 00:44:08,755
Christ, it's freezing.

748
00:44:20,467 --> 00:44:22,902
Karen?

749
00:44:22,936 --> 00:44:24,670
Yeah.

750
00:44:26,707 --> 00:44:27,674
I don't know.

751
00:44:27,708 --> 00:44:29,275
Maybe. I-I don't know.

752
00:44:29,309 --> 00:44:31,110
I don't get how you have a kid

753
00:44:31,145 --> 00:44:33,613
and not give a shit
what happens to it.

754
00:44:33,647 --> 00:44:35,281
Retarded, two heads,

755
00:44:35,315 --> 00:44:39,284
no face, whatever--
it's still you.

756
00:44:39,318 --> 00:44:41,687
No face?

757
00:44:41,721 --> 00:44:44,724
Yeah, well, maybe it would
have to have a face.

758
00:44:49,396 --> 00:44:52,934
You should go home.

759
00:44:52,968 --> 00:44:54,936
Oh, you kicking me out?

760
00:44:58,341 --> 00:45:00,308
Get your ass back in the house

761
00:45:00,343 --> 00:45:02,745
and stop thinking so much.

762
00:45:05,415 --> 00:45:07,516
You want to fuck again?

763
00:45:08,985 --> 00:45:11,953
I'm only gonna be up
a couple more minutes.

764
00:45:28,471 --> 00:45:29,437
Hey, pal.

765
00:45:29,472 --> 00:45:31,606
Hey, buddy! Pal!

766
00:45:31,641 --> 00:45:34,009
Got a light?
When are you gonna give those up?

767
00:45:34,043 --> 00:45:35,110
They're gonna kill you.

768
00:45:35,144 --> 00:45:36,178
I know.

769
00:45:36,212 --> 00:45:37,679
I'm gonna try hypnosis next.

770
00:45:37,714 --> 00:45:39,615
Uh, no, don't.
No, sorry.

771
00:45:39,649 --> 00:45:41,017
Where's your I.D. badge?

772
00:45:41,051 --> 00:45:44,119
Oh, left it in my locker.

773
00:45:44,153 --> 00:45:45,287
Shift's not over.

774
00:45:45,321 --> 00:45:47,155
Left my inhaler...

775
00:45:48,358 --> 00:45:49,525
...in the car.

776
00:45:49,559 --> 00:45:52,160
Tuberculosis and
asthma. Horrible.

777
00:45:52,195 --> 00:45:53,696
Chuck, we got trouble on seven.

778
00:45:53,730 --> 00:45:55,597
Psych unit.
Roger that.

779
00:45:55,632 --> 00:45:57,766
Got to keep
your I.D. badge visible

780
00:45:57,800 --> 00:45:59,267
at all times
on hospital grounds.

781
00:46:15,217 --> 00:46:16,851
Debbie!

782
00:46:16,885 --> 00:46:18,052
Get in the car.

783
00:46:18,087 --> 00:46:19,454
Debbie, get in the car.

784
00:46:19,489 --> 00:46:20,222
Get in the car.

785
00:46:20,256 --> 00:46:21,691
Debs, get in the car!

786
00:46:21,725 --> 00:46:23,292
Get in the car!

787
00:46:33,238 --> 00:46:35,540
I love you, Debbie!

788
00:46:37,176 --> 00:46:39,043
Debbie, I love you!

789
00:46:41,080 --> 00:46:44,082
She said we're better
off without her.

790
00:46:53,959 --> 00:46:55,993
You will have two
hours for this exam.

791
00:46:56,028 --> 00:46:58,562
This is multiple choice.

792
00:46:58,597 --> 00:47:00,665
If you change an answer,
be sure to fully erase

793
00:47:00,699 --> 00:47:04,001
your first answer and
clearly circle your second.

794
00:47:04,036 --> 00:47:05,436
I am not...

795
00:47:08,707 --> 00:47:10,442
I am not a mind reader.

796
00:47:10,476 --> 00:47:15,281
If you do not know an answer,
move on and come back to...

797
00:47:24,157 --> 00:47:25,690
Where you going?

798
00:47:25,725 --> 00:47:28,026
Anywhere far the fuck
away from here.

799
00:47:28,060 --> 00:47:30,895
Hey, I went back
to school today.

800
00:47:30,930 --> 00:47:33,264
Took the AP Physics final.

801
00:47:33,299 --> 00:47:36,200
You haven't even
been going to class.

802
00:47:36,235 --> 00:47:39,237
I read the book a
couple years ago.

803
00:47:51,450 --> 00:47:53,985
This is it, Mom.

804
00:47:54,019 --> 00:47:55,320
Last chance.

805
00:47:55,354 --> 00:47:57,055
I'm not kidding,

806
00:47:57,090 --> 00:47:58,290
I'm gone.

807
00:47:58,324 --> 00:48:00,992
It's me or the baby.

808
00:48:01,027 --> 00:48:02,660
Decide.

809
00:48:04,363 --> 00:48:06,764
Please don't do this.

810
00:48:06,799 --> 00:48:10,268
Me or the baby.

811
00:48:12,271 --> 00:48:14,538
The baby, sweetheart.

812
00:48:28,219 --> 00:48:29,853
Karen!

813
00:48:33,358 --> 00:48:34,224
Karen!

814
00:48:41,834 --> 00:48:44,669
You know, you're
going to regret this.

815
00:49:24,275 --> 00:49:26,476
Ow, ow, ow! I thought you said
these things didn't hurt!

816
00:49:26,511 --> 00:49:27,978
I lied.

817
00:49:28,012 --> 00:49:29,346
Ow! Dude, knock it off.

818
00:49:29,381 --> 00:49:31,249
Ow!

819
00:49:31,283 --> 00:49:33,251
Carl's having an air soft war
with Jimmy in the living room.

820
00:49:33,286 --> 00:49:35,888
They're gonna put a dent
in the TV screen again.

821
00:49:35,922 --> 00:49:38,825
Outside! I told you both
twice already!

822
00:49:38,859 --> 00:49:41,093
Turkey?
Get used to it.

823
00:49:41,128 --> 00:49:42,995
That and Carl's
Morton leftovers

824
00:49:43,030 --> 00:49:45,765
are going to tide us over
for the next two weeks.

825
00:49:45,799 --> 00:49:47,333
Listen, I kind of need to talk

826
00:49:47,368 --> 00:49:48,935
to you about something.

827
00:49:50,472 --> 00:49:52,739
Don't worry about her.
She doesn't speak any English.

828
00:49:52,774 --> 00:49:54,341
She living here now?

829
00:49:54,375 --> 00:49:55,910
Good Lord, I hope not.

830
00:49:55,944 --> 00:49:58,279
You know, Jimmy's dad Lloyd?

831
00:49:58,313 --> 00:49:59,680
I, uh, think we kind of...

832
00:50:02,718 --> 00:50:04,252
Oh, Jesus.

833
00:50:04,286 --> 00:50:06,220
We're broke, Frank.

834
00:50:12,395 --> 00:50:15,297
I haven't hidden money in
there since you cleaned us out

835
00:50:15,332 --> 00:50:17,133
last May.

836
00:50:17,167 --> 00:50:18,968
Where is it?

837
00:50:20,170 --> 00:50:22,771
There is no money.

838
00:50:31,513 --> 00:50:32,479
Whoa! No. Those are mine.

839
00:50:32,514 --> 00:50:34,381
Come on, let him go, Ian.

840
00:50:34,415 --> 00:50:35,649
No, put it back!

841
00:50:35,683 --> 00:50:37,117
What, are you
fucking kidding me?

842
00:50:37,151 --> 00:50:38,652
Hey! Hey! Watch it!
Get off of me!

843
00:50:39,854 --> 00:50:41,155
Hey, stop that!
Are you kidding me?!

844
00:50:41,189 --> 00:50:42,824
Hey! Hey!

845
00:50:42,858 --> 00:50:44,125
Listen!
Fucking stop it!

846
00:50:44,159 --> 00:50:45,293
Knock it off!

847
00:50:47,764 --> 00:50:49,398
