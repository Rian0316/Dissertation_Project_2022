I'm sorry?
你说什么呢?

5
00:00:09,810 --> 00:00:13,060

So,do you find the weather satisfying?

Please don't do that.

you have something awkward to discuss with someone,
好吧  但我以为当你准备与某人
交谈尴尬之事前

13
00:00:39,260 --> 00:00:43,030
it's more palatable to preface
it with banal chit chat.
先用闲聊做些铺垫会自在一些

14
00:00:43,890 --> 00:00:47,110
So,this wasn't the awkward part?
尴尬的部分还没到?

15
00:00:48,540 --> 00:00:50,910

Anyway,should you have
any interaction with her,

00:01:49,640 --> 00:01:54,140
it would be most helpful that
she not see you as a sexual rival.

You're sitting in your
apartment,it's late,you're alone.

like a viable sexual candidate.
就连Leonard也突然成为
适合的交配对象了

In which,I believe I'm
gaining remarkable fluency.

should have ended after 20 minutes.

不要往他身上喷广告里那种香水

No matter how much you put on.
不管你往身上喷多少

- May I come in?
- No.
- 我能进来吗

you and Leonard crossed some sort of line.

online,and apparently female primates,

you know,uh,apes,chimpanzees,you.
呃 像猿类 黑猩猩 还有你

he's being courted by another female.
当雄性配偶被其他雌性包围时
对他们的欲望会显著提高

218
00:14:05,100 --> 00:14:07,860
Now,this effect is intensified
when the rival female

is secreting the pheromones
associated with ovulation.

Clearly,I'm 14 days too early.
看样子 她大姨妈还有14天才来

cure yellow fever and malaria,

why can't they do something
about lactose intolerance?

Leonard,you're going
to have to let this go.

What are you doing?

apparently is destined to go unsatisfied.

I'm helping you with Stephanie.

By making constipated moose sounds?

When I fail to open this jar and you succeed,it
will establish you as the "alpha" male.
我开不了这瓶罐头 而你能打开
就可以树立你的猛男形象

an exhibition of physical domination,

she produces the hormone oxytocin.

239
00:15:31,030 --> 00:15:32,770
If the two of you then
engage in intercourse,

240
00:15:32,780 --> 00:15:35,080
this will create the
biochemical reaction in the brain
大脑里会产生生化反应

241
00:15:35,090 --> 00:15:39,490
which lay people naively
interpret as "falling in love."
普通人会天真地以为是"相爱了"

242
00:15:43,430 --> 00:15:47,110
Would it work if I just
punched you in the face?
那揍你一拳能不能达到效果?

243
00:15:47,570 --> 00:15:50,940
Yes,actually it would,but
let's see how the lid goes.
嗯 应该可以

00:15:51,360 --> 00:15:55,180
I'm not strong
enough,Leonard,you'll have to do it.

it,and that's not surprising.
是的 是的 他能搞定 没啥意外的

00:16:20,710 --> 00:16:25,770
This is something I long ago came to
peace with in my role as the beta male.
我早就安分于自己的小弟身份

251
00:16:27,410 --> 00:16:30,200

What a beautiful job Stephanie did.
Stephanie的活干得真漂亮

261
00:17:12,110 --> 00:17:14,580
I might have gone with a mattress
suture instead of a blanket stitch,
虽然我更喜欢褥式缝合法
而不是毯边锁缝针法

262
00:17:14,600 --> 00:17:16,970
but you can' argue with her results.

vomiting,coitus is contra-indicated.
她说的对 只要你还在呕吐
性交不会爽到哪里去

278
00:18:06,290 --> 00:18:08,420
