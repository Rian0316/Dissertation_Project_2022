00:00:02,168 --> 00:00:03,100
“创始吸血鬼”前情提要
ELlJAH: Previously on The Originals ;

2
00:00:03,236 --> 00:00:05,204
杀了他
如果我们不能
Kill him. If we can't all create

3
00:00:05,338 --> 00:00:08,171
联手合作，那还有什么意义？
some sort of community,
then what's the point?

4
00:00:08,308 --> 00:00:10,242
不如杀掉彼此早点了事
Kill each other
and get it all over with.

5
00:00:10,377 --> 00:00:11,708
如果你我都不能和平相处
ELIJAH; If there is no peace between us,

6
00:00:11,845 --> 00:00:14,211
那你怎么能指望其他人跟随呢？
then how can you expect
others to follow suit?

7
00:00:14,347 --> 00:00:17,407
这个城市的居民不会遵守这个协定的
KLAUS: The city's inhabitants will
not adhere to this agreement.

8
00:00:17,550 --> 00:00:19,882
马赛尔杰拉德要我们带个消息
We have a message from Marcel Gerard.

9
00:00:20,020 --> 00:00:21,044
（永无宁日）

10
00:00:21,187 --> 00:00:22,415
我们两个订婚了
You and I were betrothed.

11
00:00:22,555 --> 00:00:24,284
我想这就让我们变得跟皇室一样了
I guess that makes us
kind of like royalty.

12
00:00:24,424 --> 00:00:27,188
我们缔结了一个联盟
这对狼人将是个重大转折
We made an alliance that's gonna
change everything for the wolves.

13
00:00:27,327 --> 00:00:29,192
- 与谁结盟？
- 克劳斯
-An alliance with who?
-Klaus.

14
00:00:29,329 --> 00:00:32,162
月光戒指保护狼人免受诅咒之苦
A moonlight ring to protect
werewolves from the curse.

15
00:00:32,298 --> 00:00:33,322
你想要我怎么做？
What do I have to do?

16
00:00:33,466 --> 00:00:35,661
我被下咒了
我不知道我还剩多长时间
I've been hexed, and
I don't know how long I have.

17
00:00:35,802 --> 00:00:36,962
药物不管用了
The pills, they're not working.

18
00:00:37,103 --> 00:00:39,003
这种诅咒是由魔法开始的
These hexes, they start with magic.

19
00:00:39,139 --> 00:00:40,902
它们会改变大脑的化学物质
They alter the very
chemistry of the brain.

20
00:00:41,041 --> 00:00:42,167
我没法恢复了
I can't be fixed?

21
00:00:42,308 --> 00:00:44,538
只有死亡，我的，还有你的
There's only death.
Mine and yours.

22
00:01:00,760 --> 00:01:04,218
这是主的身体，这是主的血
This is the body.
This is the blood.

23
00:01:04,364 --> 00:01:09,358
愿能洗清我的罪过，保护我的灵魂
直到永远
May they cleanse me of sin and
preserve my soul in life everlasting.

24
00:01:12,338 --> 00:01:16,900
现在是不是有点晚了，神父
I'd say it's a little late
for that, Father.

25
00:01:19,012 --> 00:01:21,037
看来你仍坚持着你的信仰
I see you still have your faith.

26
00:01:21,181 --> 00:01:25,447
- 别过来
- 可惜它终究无法拯放你
-Stay back.
-lf only it could save you.

27
00:01:30,123 --> 00:01:31,784
西恩，天啊，不
Sean, God, no!

28
00:01:31,925 --> 00:01:34,689
敬永生
To life everlasting.

29
00:01:35,995 --> 00:01:38,463
- 喝吧
滚开，魔鬼
-Drink.
-Be gone, demon!

30
00:01:38,598 --> 00:01:40,566
来吧，就一口
Come now, just one sip.

31
00:01:40,700 --> 00:01:41,792
不
No.

32
00:01:47,006 --> 00:01:49,406
我知道你是谁，你这可恶的贱人
I know who you are,
you hateful bitch.

33
00:01:52,612 --> 00:01:54,705
西恩，我试着…
Oh, Sean, I tried....

34
00:01:54,848 --> 00:01:56,611
我试着帮助你，试着拯救你
I tried to help you.
I tried to save you.

35
00:01:56,749 --> 00:01:58,774
但这个城市…
But this city....

36
00:01:59,552 --> 00:02:01,611
这个城市有着太多恶魔
This city is full of monsters.

37
00:02:04,157 --> 00:02:06,387
是啊，相信我，我很清楚
Yeah. Trust me, I know.

38
00:02:07,660 --> 00:02:09,252
记得提醒我永远别招惹女巫
Remind me to never piss off a witch.

39
00:02:12,999 --> 00:02:14,694
帮我扶着他侧躺
Help me get him on his side.

40
00:02:23,510 --> 00:02:25,410
卡蜜
Cami.

41
00:02:25,545 --> 00:02:26,978
基兰叔叔？
Uncle Kieran?

42
00:02:31,518 --> 00:02:33,247
你要对我做什么？
What do you want from me?

43
00:02:36,422 --> 00:02:38,515
你也看到了，对吧？
You saw that, right?

44
00:02:38,658 --> 00:02:41,752
虽然只有一瞬间
但那就是他
It was just for a second,
but it was him.

45
00:02:44,564 --> 00:02:46,031
我不知道，卡蜜
I don't know, Cami.

46
00:02:46,166 --> 00:02:48,600
也许在这疯狂之下他的本性还在
I mean, maybe he's still in
there underneath all the crazy,

47
00:02:48,735 --> 00:02:51,067
但这疯狂太严重了
but the crazy is pretty thick.

48
00:02:52,839 --> 00:02:56,400
或许他的大脑需要刺激一下
Maybe he just needs
a shock to his system,

49
00:02:56,543 --> 00:02:58,306
把不好的东西清除
something to wipe the slate clean.

50
00:02:58,444 --> 00:03:02,107
小约，我想我有办法能治好他
Josh, I think I have an idea
on how to fix him.

51
00:03:05,318 --> 00:03:10,119
片名：创始吸血鬼（第一季）
剧名：无畏死亡

52
00:03:13,960 --> 00:03:16,190
主演：约瑟夫摩根
(BOOKS CLATTERlNG)

53
00:03:17,463 --> 00:03:19,124
在找什么？需要帮忙吗？
主演：丹尼尔吉利斯
Can I help you find something?

54
00:03:19,265 --> 00:03:21,199
是的，我想你能帮上忙
Yes. In fact, I believe you can.

55
00:03:22,535 --> 00:03:26,062
我在找一本书，大概这么大
I'm looking for a book,
about yea big,

56
00:03:26,206 --> 00:03:29,141
上面记录着母亲的那些强大咒语
主演：菲比托金
filled with our mother's
most powerful spells.

57
00:03:29,275 --> 00:03:32,403
看样子不知所踪了
It appears to have been misplaced.

58
00:03:32,545 --> 00:03:34,012
真悬啊
-How very mysterious.
-lndeed.

59
00:03:34,080 --> 00:03:37,808
确实，起初我担心
主演：查尔斯麦可戴维斯
At first, I feared
the witches had succeeded

60
00:03:37,016 --> 00:03:40,110
是不是被那些女巫拿去了
in their efforts to obtain it,

61
00:03:40,253 --> 00:03:42,380
但考虑到她们上次尝试的结果是
主演：莉雅派普斯
but considering
their last attempt ended

62
00:03:42,522 --> 00:03:45,787
我把那位大块头纹身男的双手砍下来
主演：丹妮儿坎贝尔
with me relieving a rather
large, tattooed gentleman

63
00:03:45,892 --> 00:03:47,826
我开始怀疑
of his hands, I began to wonder

64
00:03:47,961 --> 00:03:50,452
会不会是家贼难防
if the thief wasn't
a bit closer to home.

65
00:03:54,033 --> 00:03:56,729
别让我难做事，哥哥
Don't make this harder
than it needs to be, brother.

66
00:04:00,073 --> 00:04:04,066
说实话，我确实怀疑你突然对
Well, admittedly, I did have a
theory that your sudden interest

67
00:04:04,210 --> 00:04:07,373
母亲的魔法书感兴趣，是不是因为你
in mother's grimoire was in some way
related to whatever foolishness

68
00:04:07,513 --> 00:04:09,981
和新月族狼人之间那愚蠢的勾当
you've been conducting
with the Crescent wolves.

69
00:04:10,116 --> 00:04:12,641
因此，我自作主张
Therefore, I took it
upon myself to carefully

70
00:04:12,785 --> 00:04:15,413
将魔法书安放到了别处，以防有人垂涎
制片：克里斯多福贺利尔
place it where naughty,
little fingers could not pry.

71
00:04:15,622 --> 00:04:18,591
我还以为所有人之中你最清楚
制片：兰斯安德森
And here I thought you,
of all people,

72
00:04:17,390 --> 00:04:22,320
我只是想帮助那些狼人
would understand, I am simply
trying to help those wolves.

73
00:04:23,329 --> 00:04:25,559
你可以说我是慈悲为怀
Play Samaritan to the abused,

74
00:04:25,698 --> 00:04:28,997
或者是保护弱小也行
champion to the underdog,
so to speak.

75
00:04:29,135 --> 00:04:30,932
那你还真是高尚
制片：邦妮怀斯
How splendidly noble of you.

76
00:04:30,970 --> 00:04:31,902
难道你没想过
制片：邦妮怀斯
Have you ever considered
that, like you,

77
00:04:32,038 --> 00:04:34,404
和你一样
我只是想保护海莉的安全
I am trying to keep Hayley safe,

78
00:04:34,540 --> 00:04:36,940
用我们母亲的魔法让他们变得更强大
using our mother's magic
to empower her people

79
00:04:37,076 --> 00:04:38,873
这样才有能力保护她？
so they are capable
of protecting her?

80
00:04:39,012 --> 00:04:41,708
话是这么说
除非他们决定以此来报复
Yes, unless, of course,
they decide to seek retribution

81
00:04:41,848 --> 00:04:44,510
多年被流放之仇
for decades held in exile.

82
00:04:46,085 --> 00:04:48,451
这样海莉将会被卷入一场叛乱中
编剧：艾胥莉莱尔，巴特尼克森
And Hayley will find herself
in the middle of an uprising.

83
00:04:49,722 --> 00:04:51,485
那只会引发更多的暴力冲突
导演：凯莉赛勒斯
One that will only
provoke further violence.

84
00:04:51,624 --> 00:04:55,617
你这么做很有可能挑起
纽奥良的战火，弟弟
You see, you risk turning New
Orleans into a war zone, brother.

85
00:04:56,496 --> 00:04:58,589
我绝不允许此事发生
I won't let that happen.

86
00:04:58,731 --> 00:05:01,564
战争在我们回来之前早已揭开序慕
The drums of war were beating
long before we returned.

87
00:05:02,001 --> 00:05:05,164
我建议你还是少说话，多倾听
I suggest you use a little less of
this and a little more of these.

88
00:05:09,842 --> 00:05:11,002
绝对不行
Whoa, no way.

89
00:05:11,144 --> 00:05:13,476
卡蜜，小约已经告诉我事情有多严重了
Cami, Josh told
me how bad things have gotten.

90
00:05:13,613 --> 00:05:15,240
我应该陪在你身边，让我帮你
I should be there for you.
Just let me help.

91
00:05:15,381 --> 00:05:17,178
怎么帮？让自己去送死吗？
How, by getting yourself killed?

92
00:05:17,317 --> 00:05:18,909
如今你正被人追杀，马赛尔
You have a target
on your back, Marcel.

93
00:05:19,052 --> 00:05:21,452
我最不愿看到的就是你因为我而受伤
The last thing I need is for
you to get hurt because of me.

94
00:05:21,587 --> 00:05:24,055
我更担心你，基兰很危险
I'm more worried about you.
Kieran's dangerous.

95
00:05:24,190 --> 00:05:25,316
我能应付得来
I got this.

96
00:05:25,458 --> 00:05:27,153
你要是过来，我就亲自
把你赶出去，知道吗？
You come here, I'll throw
you out myself, all right?

97
00:05:27,293 --> 00:05:28,555
我说真的
I mean it.

98
00:05:31,931 --> 00:05:33,592
这是怎么回事？
What the hell?

99
00:05:33,733 --> 00:05:35,098
好吧，没错
OK. Yeah.

100
00:05:35,234 --> 00:05:38,294
这里的气氛确实有点像犯罪现场
Totally see how we got kind of a
crime scene vibe happening here.

101
00:05:38,438 --> 00:05:40,338
不用害怕，好吗？
Just don't freak out, OK?

102
00:05:41,774 --> 00:05:44,242
你好，我是薛斯基医生
Hi. I'm Dr. Sheski.

103
00:05:45,611 --> 00:05:46,942
我只是要检查一下你的脉搏
-Just gonna get your pulse.
-(SHOUTS, SNARLS)

104
00:06:01,260 --> 00:06:03,728
开口之前要仔细想清楚
Think very carefully
before you speak.

105
00:06:03,863 --> 00:06:05,592
你的声音很可能让我后悔
The sound of your voice
is likely to make me

106
00:06:05,732 --> 00:06:08,064
我对你所展现出的仁慈
regret what mercy
I've shown thus far.

107
00:06:08,201 --> 00:06:10,396
是的，我知道
我在你的黑名单上
Yeah, yeah. I know, I'm on your
"who's been naughty" list.

108
00:06:10,536 --> 00:06:11,833
问题是，卡蜜需要你
Thing is, Cami needs you.

109
00:06:11,971 --> 00:06:15,168
你对我的愤怒
不要牵连到她身上
Whatever anger you have towards
me, don't make her suffer for it.

110
00:06:15,308 --> 00:06:16,969
她和基兰在一起
She's with Kieran.

111
00:06:19,078 --> 00:06:20,636
我必须让当局知道
I'm gonna have to let
the authorities know

112
00:06:20,780 --> 00:06:22,372
这里发生了什么事
what the hell is going on here.

113
00:06:22,515 --> 00:06:23,982
- 小约
- 对了
-Josh?
-Oh, right.

114
00:06:24,117 --> 00:06:25,812
老兄，别慌
Dude, be cool.

115
00:06:25,952 --> 00:06:28,785
只是个神父由于吸血鬼的原因
被女巫下咒了
It's just a priest hexed by a
witch because of some vampires.

116
00:06:28,921 --> 00:06:31,947
接受这些现实，然后忘记它们
Accept that these things
are real, then forget them.

117
00:06:32,091 --> 00:06:35,083
我是说等一下，等一下再忘记
I mean later.
You forget them later.

118
00:06:35,228 --> 00:06:37,458
该死，好吧，我重新说
Crap. OK. Let me start over.

119
00:06:37,597 --> 00:06:40,964
薛斯基医生
我叔叔需要镇定剂，强效的
Dr. Sheski, my uncle needs
to be sedated, something strong.

120
00:06:41,100 --> 00:06:44,069
镇定剂？
他看起来需要进加护病房
Sedation?
He looks like he should be in an lCU.

121
00:06:44,203 --> 00:06:46,398
是啊，另一个女巫对他施了边界咒
Yeah. See, this other witch
put this boundary spell on him.

122
00:06:46,539 --> 00:06:47,836
所以他被困在这里了
So he's kind of stuck in here.

123
00:06:47,974 --> 00:06:50,204
这个人营养不良
严重脱水
This man is malnourished,
severely dehydrated.

124
00:06:50,343 --> 00:06:53,107
所以才请你来
但首先，医生
Which is why you're here.
But first, doctor,

125
00:06:53,246 --> 00:06:55,111
你了解休克疗法吗？
what do you know
about shock therapy?

126
00:06:55,248 --> 00:06:57,113
电痉挛疗法？
ECT?

127
00:06:57,617 --> 00:06:59,881
首先，那十分危险
First, it's incredibly dangerous.

128
00:07:00,019 --> 00:07:03,477
但众所周知，它被用来治疗极端精神病
But it has been known to help
treat cases of extreme psychosis?

129
00:07:05,258 --> 00:07:07,453
回答这位女士的问题
Answer the nice lady.

130
00:07:09,128 --> 00:07:14,327
我们还不完全了解这种疗法
但是的，有些病人
We don't fully understand it yet,
but, yes, in some patients,

131
00:07:14,467 --> 00:07:16,628
利用电流诱发痉孪
using electrical current
to induce seizures

132
00:07:16,769 --> 00:07:20,466
可以阻止精神病的发作
事实上就是重启大脑
can subvert a psychotic episode,
in effect, rebooting the brain,

133
00:07:20,606 --> 00:07:22,506
但只在非常极端的情况下
我们才会考虑…
but only in the most extreme
cases, do we even consider--

134
00:07:22,642 --> 00:07:25,975
就像我朋友讲的
我们说的是一个神父被女巫下了咒
Like my friend said, we're talking
about a priest hexed by a witch.

135
00:07:26,112 --> 00:07:28,205
我想不出比这更极端的情况了
I don't think it gets
any more extreme than that.

136
00:07:31,284 --> 00:07:33,081
就这样
That's it.

137
00:07:33,219 --> 00:07:36,245
吸气
吐气
Inhale and release.

138
00:07:37,557 --> 00:07:40,082
这就意味着不打无痛分娩针了吧？
I guess this means no epidural, huh?

139
00:07:40,226 --> 00:07:43,491
你确定我不能在医院那种
You sure I can't do this
thing in, say, a hospital,

140
00:07:43,629 --> 00:07:45,790
有医生有药物的环境下生产吗？
you know, the place
with the doctors and the drugs?

141
00:07:45,932 --> 00:07:48,059
亲爱的，狼人在你出生之前
Honey, the werewolves have been
having babies out here

142
00:07:48,201 --> 00:07:50,169
就一直在这里生产
别担心了
since before you were born.
Stop worrying.

143
00:07:50,303 --> 00:07:53,136
好吧
然后呢，伊芙？
OK.
Then what, Eve?

144
00:07:53,272 --> 00:07:57,402
我都不知道有妈妈是什么感觉
更别说当妈妈了
I don't even know what it's like to
have a mother, let alone be one.

145
00:07:57,543 --> 00:08:01,809
相信我，到了那个时候
你自然就会知道怎么做
Trust me, when the time comes,
you'll know exactly what to do.

146
00:08:01,948 --> 00:08:03,472
希望如此
I hope so.

147
00:08:03,616 --> 00:08:05,777
虽然想像克劳斯换尿布很有趣
As fun as it is to image Klaus
changing dirty diapers,

148
00:08:05,918 --> 00:08:08,113
但我确定我要一个人做这些了
I'm pretty sure
that I'll be doing this alone.

149
00:08:08,254 --> 00:08:10,848
我倒不这么认为
I somehow doubt that.

150
00:08:14,293 --> 00:08:16,693
抱歉打扰了
Pardon the interruption.

151
00:08:16,829 --> 00:08:18,319
我希望能跟疑似叛乱同谋
I wonder if I might have a quick word

152
00:08:18,464 --> 00:08:21,558
简单说几句话
with the conspirators
of a supposed uprising.

153
00:08:27,240 --> 00:08:28,867
你们正在犯一个很大的错误
You're making a grave mistake.

154
00:08:30,209 --> 00:08:32,074
所以你在担心我们，是吗？
So you're just worried about us.
Is that it?

155
00:08:32,211 --> 00:08:35,544
听着，以利亚
我们知道你弟弟的名声不好
Look, Elijah, we know all about
your brother's reputation,

156
00:08:35,681 --> 00:08:38,912
但即使只有很小的机会
这些戒指可以帮我们
but if there is even a chance
that these rings can help us

157
00:08:39,051 --> 00:08:40,678
控制住诅咒…
take control of our curse--

158
00:08:40,820 --> 00:08:42,151
或者说天赋
Our gift.

159
00:08:42,288 --> 00:08:45,451
那么坦白说
我们不在乎他真正的目的
Then, honestly, we don't
care what he's really after.

160
00:08:45,591 --> 00:08:48,719
- 也没必要在乎
- 我懂了
-Won't have to.
-I see.

161
00:08:48,861 --> 00:08:50,192
但法语区里有些人
There are those in the Quarter

162
00:08:50,329 --> 00:08:51,819
会认为这是很严重的挑衅
who will consider this
a great provocation.

163
00:08:51,964 --> 00:08:54,524
很显然，很多人认为我们呼吸都是挑衅
Apparently, most of them see
us breathing the same way.

164
00:08:59,739 --> 00:09:02,902
你看着我的眼睛签着了宣誓词
You signed a pledge, and you looked
me in the eye as you did so.

165
00:09:03,042 --> 00:09:04,805
我们也不想要战争，以利亚
We don't want a fight, Elijah.

166
00:09:04,944 --> 00:09:07,037
我们只是想要更好的生活
We just want a better life.

167
00:09:07,179 --> 00:09:10,478
和我弟弟结盟绝不可能达到这个目的
Allegiance with my brother will
guarantee you anything but that.

168
00:09:14,921 --> 00:09:16,183
怎么回事？
What the hell?

169
00:09:27,066 --> 00:09:28,897
你们谁说了算？
Which one of you is in charge?

170
00:09:29,035 --> 00:09:30,434
你是谁？
Who's asking?

171
00:10:03,603 --> 00:10:04,968
海莉，你还好吗？
(MUFFLED) Hayley, are you OK?

172
00:10:19,185 --> 00:10:21,745
没事的，来，过来
It's OK. Here. Come here.

173
00:10:22,555 --> 00:10:24,284
天啊
Oh, God.

174
00:10:28,260 --> 00:10:29,284
杰克森
Jackson?

175
00:10:30,296 --> 00:10:32,526
来，把他带走
Here. Get him away from here.

176
00:10:32,665 --> 00:10:34,565
来吧
Come on.

177
00:10:34,700 --> 00:10:37,032
- 海莉
- 以利亚
-Hayley.
-Elijah.

178
00:10:42,775 --> 00:10:43,833
附子草
Wolfsbane.

179
00:10:43,976 --> 00:10:45,910
一定是放在油箱里了
It must have been in the gas tank.

180
00:10:48,314 --> 00:10:49,645
你速度最快
You're the fastest.

181
00:10:49,782 --> 00:10:51,511
带着他，还有那些不能自己走的
Take him, anyone else who
can't walk on their own.

182
00:10:56,122 --> 00:10:58,454
没事，以利亚，我很好
It's OK, Elijah. I'm fine.

183
00:10:58,591 --> 00:10:59,990
他们需要你的帮助
They need your help.

184
00:11:05,798 --> 00:11:07,265
撑着点，好吗？
Just hang in there, OK?

185
00:11:08,167 --> 00:11:09,429
奥利佛，不要
Oliver, no.

186
00:11:10,169 --> 00:11:12,637
- 啊！
- 按住这里
-Oh, God.
-Press here.

187
00:11:13,372 --> 00:11:15,704
把你的衬衫给我，快
Give me your shirt. Now!

188
00:11:16,375 --> 00:11:17,842
没事的
It's OK.

189
00:11:29,689 --> 00:11:31,122
你怎么学会这些的？
How'd you learn how to do that?

190
00:11:31,257 --> 00:11:33,623
如果你13岁就离家
你会学到很多东西
You get a hell of an education
when you leave home at 13.

191
00:11:35,294 --> 00:11:37,819
这样能减缓失血
至少在伤口愈合之前
That should slow the bleeding,
at least until the healing kicks in.

192
00:11:47,640 --> 00:11:49,540
吸血鬼
The vampires.

193
00:11:50,076 --> 00:11:53,512
他们甚至没胆自己动手
干这种龌龊事
They don't even have the guts to
do their own dirty work themselves.

194
00:11:53,646 --> 00:11:56,080
干嘛自己动手
反正可以魅惑
I mean, why bother
when you can just compel

195
00:11:56,215 --> 00:11:58,046
无辜的人来做事
some poor son of a bitch
to do it for you?

196
00:11:58,184 --> 00:12:00,618
我们要狠狠地反击
I say we hit them back, hard.

197
00:12:00,753 --> 00:12:02,516
在这待着，奥利佛
Stay here, Oliver.

198
00:12:02,655 --> 00:12:04,589
我需要你在我回来之前照顾大家
I need you to look after
everyone until I get back.

199
00:12:04,724 --> 00:12:06,885
- 你要去哪？
- 如果这是吸血鬼干的
-Where the hell are you going?
-lf this was vampires,

200
00:12:07,026 --> 00:12:10,086
那我很确定是谁下的命令
I'm pretty sure that I can guess
who gave the order.

201
00:12:13,566 --> 00:12:14,999
我要去找马赛尔
I'm gonna go find Marcel.

202
00:12:26,812 --> 00:12:29,372
地狱里有个专门给
你们这类怪物待的地方
There's a special place
in hell for your kind.

203
00:12:29,515 --> 00:12:31,415
我可不是第一次听到这种话
Not the first time
I've heard that one.

204
00:12:35,054 --> 00:12:37,113
瞧瞧这个阴森的小地方
Well, isn't this
a gruesome, little scene?

205
00:12:37,256 --> 00:12:39,486
克劳斯，你来干什么？
Klaus, what are you doing here?

206
00:12:39,625 --> 00:12:42,093
我接到一通以你为名义的紧急电话
I received an urgent call
on your behalf.

207
00:12:42,228 --> 00:12:43,991
然后我好像接到了个任务
It seems I've been tasked with doing

208
00:12:44,130 --> 00:12:46,189
要做件你的胆小鬼男友做不到的事
what your coward
of a boyfriend could not,

209
00:12:46,332 --> 00:12:48,391
看这情况应该是要劝阻你
which, by the looks of things,
is dissuading you

210
00:12:48,534 --> 00:12:50,968
别干现在这件蠢事
from whatever madness
it is you're about to attempt.

211
00:12:52,104 --> 00:12:53,537
你准备好了吗？
Are you ready?

212
00:12:53,672 --> 00:12:56,232
拜托，我求求你了
别逼我干这事
Please, I'm begging you,
don't force me to do this.

213
00:12:56,375 --> 00:12:58,002
好啊，那我自己来
Fine. I'll do it myself.

214
00:13:05,317 --> 00:13:08,946
卡蜜儿，你叔叔是个好人
-(MACHlNE POWERS UP)
-Camille, your uncle is a good man.

215
00:13:09,088 --> 00:13:10,817
他不该受这种苦
He shouldn't suffer.

216
00:13:10,956 --> 00:13:14,153
他已经受了好几个星期的苦了
他快死了，克劳斯
He's been suffering for weeks.
He's dying, Klaus.

217
00:13:14,293 --> 00:13:16,318
这说不定是他能活下来的唯一机会
This might be the only
chance he's got.

218
00:13:30,709 --> 00:13:32,074
海莉
Hayley.

219
00:13:32,211 --> 00:13:34,611
我得去处理一些事
我会尽快回来
I have to take care of something.
I'll be back as soon as I can.

220
00:13:34,747 --> 00:13:37,079
- 你在哪？
- 以利亚，我没事
-Where are you?
-Elijah, I'm fine.

221
00:13:37,216 --> 00:13:40,947
我不在的时候帮我照顾狼群，好吗？
Just take care of the pack
while I'm gone, please?

222
00:13:41,086 --> 00:13:42,451
她没事吧？
Is she OK?

223
00:13:42,588 --> 00:13:44,055
看样子是的
Apparently, yes.

224
00:13:45,457 --> 00:13:48,290
还好炸弹在那里爆炸了
It's a good thing that bomb
went off where it did.

225
00:13:48,928 --> 00:13:50,555
不然情况可能更糟
Could've been a lot worse.

226
00:13:50,696 --> 00:13:52,391
可能会有人死掉
People could've got killed.

227
00:13:54,700 --> 00:13:56,463
除非
Unless....

228
00:14:03,609 --> 00:14:05,702
带所有人离开这
Get everyone out of here....

229
00:14:05,845 --> 00:14:07,369
快
Now!

230
00:14:25,865 --> 00:14:27,730
（教堂 肃静区）

231
00:14:43,749 --> 00:14:45,307
卡蜜
Cami....

232
00:14:48,754 --> 00:14:51,552
你到底对我做了什么？
What the hell did you do to me?

233
00:14:51,690 --> 00:14:53,521
- 我们得再来一次
- 你认真的吗？
-We have to do it again.
-Are you serious?

234
00:14:53,659 --> 00:14:55,752
这是有关系 的，它已经起作用了
That was something coherent.
It's working.

235
00:14:56,896 --> 00:14:59,524
医生，照顾好你的病人
Doctor, see to your patient.

236
00:15:00,866 --> 00:15:02,060
离我远点
You get away from me.

237
00:15:07,006 --> 00:15:08,337
心跳不正常
Heartbeat's irregular.

238
00:15:09,341 --> 00:15:11,172
不能继续电击了，他会死的
You can't keep this up.
It'll kill him.

239
00:15:11,310 --> 00:15:12,777
不
- 卡蜜
-No.
-Cami.

240
00:15:12,912 --> 00:15:16,006
我们得好好谈谈
私底下谈
We need to have a word in private.

241
00:15:19,485 --> 00:15:21,180
我想你要做好心理准备
I think you need to prepare yourself.

242
00:15:21,320 --> 00:15:23,015
这事可能不会圆满结束
This story does not
have a happy ending.

243
00:15:23,155 --> 00:15:25,646
- 但这个治疗方法…
- 会害死他的
-But the treatments--
-Will kill him.

244
00:15:27,559 --> 00:15:29,459
如果是你亲手加速你叔叔的死亡
Were you to push him over the brink,

245
00:15:29,595 --> 00:15:31,290
我不愿看到你一生背负这样的愧疚
I would hate for you
to have to live with that,

246
00:15:31,430 --> 00:15:33,990
不管你的初衷有多么高尚
no matter how noble your aim.

247
00:15:34,900 --> 00:15:38,301
所以就这样了吗？
你要我就这样放弃吗？
So that's it, then?
You just expect me to surrender?

248
00:15:38,437 --> 00:15:40,428
也许是时候了
Maybe it's time.

249
00:15:41,573 --> 00:15:45,339
不是放弃
而是放手
Not to give up, to let go.

250
00:15:46,679 --> 00:15:48,510
这不是你说了算
It's not your decision to make.

251
00:16:09,601 --> 00:16:12,502
杰克森，她已经死了
Jackson, she's gone.

252
00:16:12,638 --> 00:16:14,902
救命！快来人！
OLlVER: Help! Somebody help!

253
00:16:15,040 --> 00:16:18,806
好，撑住，撑住，伊芙
-(EVE GROANlNG)
-OK. Hold on. Hold on, Eve.

254
00:16:29,355 --> 00:16:31,619
撑住，伊芙
撑住
Come on, Eve.
Come on.

255
00:16:31,757 --> 00:16:33,850
没事的
It's OK.

256
00:16:38,764 --> 00:16:41,824
你一个大肚姿敢来这，胆子不小啊
You got some nerve
coming up in here, mama.

257
00:16:46,205 --> 00:16:48,935
有人今早在河口攻击了我的狼群
Someone attacked my pack
in the bayou this morning,

258
00:16:49,074 --> 00:16:53,101
而我在这也没见着什么聪明人
and since I don't see any genius
mastermind types around here...

259
00:16:55,814 --> 00:16:57,748
你不如乖乖告诉我马赛尔在哪
...why don't you just tell me
where Marcel is

260
00:16:57,883 --> 00:17:00,818
然后我们就可以继续各自过生活
and we can both get
on with our day.

261
00:17:05,457 --> 00:17:07,357
你以为我在开玩笑吗？
You think I'm playing?

262
00:17:07,493 --> 00:17:09,518
受伤的都是我的家人
There were families out there.

263
00:17:10,963 --> 00:17:14,626
他以前经常去一个地方
派特森路1917号
He used to keep a place....
1917 Patterson.

264
00:17:14,767 --> 00:17:16,735
如果他还没走的话，他应该在那个地方
If he's still around, he'll be there.

265
00:17:24,009 --> 00:17:26,204
如果我是你，我不会离他那么近
I wouldn't stay that close
to him if I were you.

266
00:17:27,179 --> 00:17:30,671
他现在有点难以捉摸，还有点嗜杀
He's kind of unpredictable
and murdery.

267
00:17:30,816 --> 00:17:32,716
太奇妙了
This is fascinating.

268
00:17:32,851 --> 00:17:35,115
去找对他下咒的女巫谈谈会有用吗？
Would it be possible to speak
to the witches responsible?

269
00:17:35,254 --> 00:17:36,778
是啊，我劝你别干傻事
Yeah. You don't want to do that.

270
00:17:40,592 --> 00:17:41,854
我的天…
Holy--

271
00:17:48,267 --> 00:17:50,428
来个人帮一下忙
Hey! Little help in here!

272
00:17:56,475 --> 00:17:57,737
克劳斯，你在哪？
Klaus, where are you?

273
00:17:57,876 --> 00:18:00,037
恶魔，主的愤怒之火向你燃烧
- 这不可能
-His wrath burns against you, demon.
-This is not happening.

274
00:18:00,179 --> 00:18:01,908
我这里有点小状况，亲爱的
I'm in a bit of
a situation here, love.

275
00:18:02,047 --> 00:18:05,244
有人今早在河口丢了枚人肉炸弹
Somebody sent a suicide bomber
out to the bayou this morning.

276
00:18:05,384 --> 00:18:07,249
什么？你现在在哪？
What? Where are you?

277
00:18:07,386 --> 00:18:10,355
- 我在城里，我没事
- 给我
-I'm in the city now. I'm fine.
-Give it to me.

278
00:18:10,489 --> 00:18:12,719
我想这种攻击一定是马赛尔干的
I figured an attack like
that must have been Marcel.

279
00:18:13,759 --> 00:18:14,953
他这么多年来一直恨狼人
He's hated the wolves for years,

280
00:18:15,094 --> 00:18:17,221
还跟女巫搞了这么多事出来
and after that stunt he pulled
with the witches....

281
00:18:17,362 --> 00:18:18,522
所以我现在在找他
So I tracked him down.

282
00:18:18,664 --> 00:18:20,291
他这么费力想把我们炸死
I thought you might like
to help kick his ass

283
00:18:20,432 --> 00:18:22,366
你应该会想一起去教训他吧
for trying to blow us
to kingdom come.

284
00:18:22,501 --> 00:18:24,799
你现在把他弄出去吧
Would you get him
out of here now, please?

285
00:18:24,937 --> 00:18:27,770
要确保他什么都记不得
好，海莉，听着
Make sure he remembers nothing.
All right, Hayley, listen,

286
00:18:27,906 --> 00:18:29,931
我跟你保证，等我把这边的事搞定
I assure you,
once I am finished here,

287
00:18:30,075 --> 00:18:31,508
我将会全心全意来帮你
you will have my undivided attention.

288
00:18:31,643 --> 00:18:35,340
但这段时间，你别惹上麻烦
In the meantime,
please stay out of trouble.

289
00:18:36,849 --> 00:18:38,282
你不用担心
You don't have to worry.

290
00:18:38,417 --> 00:18:40,214
以利亚和我在一起
Elijah's with me.

291
00:18:52,498 --> 00:18:54,295
伤口现在应该愈合了
That wound should be healing by now.

292
00:18:54,433 --> 00:18:58,836
她从没杀过人
从没启动过狼人基因
She never killed anyone,
never activated the werewolf gene.

293
00:18:58,971 --> 00:19:01,667
所以她无法自我治愈，和我们不一样
So she can't heal, not like us.

294
00:19:03,509 --> 00:19:06,501
我的血能治愈她
My blood, it could heal her.

295
00:19:06,645 --> 00:19:08,636
吸血鬼的血？
Vampire blood?

296
00:19:08,780 --> 00:19:10,441
相信我，她宁愿死
Trust me, she'd rather die.

297
00:19:15,821 --> 00:19:17,686
我们不能让他们就此逃过此事
We can't just let them
get away with this.

298
00:19:17,823 --> 00:19:19,586
我们根本不知道是谁干的
We don't even know who's to blame.

299
00:19:19,725 --> 00:19:21,386
不知道才怪
The hell we don't!

300
00:19:21,527 --> 00:19:23,722
如果我们不反击，他们还会这么做
And if we don't fight back,
they'll just do it again.

301
00:19:42,047 --> 00:19:43,412
进来
Come on in.

302
00:19:44,149 --> 00:19:45,616
请坐
Have a seat.

303
00:19:45,751 --> 00:19:48,219
我想给你倒杯酒，但是…
I'd offer you a drink, but....

304
00:19:48,720 --> 00:19:51,450
- 地方不错
- 只是暂时的
-Sweet pad.
-It's just temporary.

305
00:19:51,590 --> 00:19:53,148
朋友帮我找的
Friend hooked me up.

306
00:19:53,292 --> 00:19:55,590
不管你信不信，我还是
有些分散在各处的朋友
Believe it or not, I still got
a few of those kicking around.

307
00:19:55,727 --> 00:19:58,491
我需要朋友向我通风报信
I need friends to keep me informed,

308
00:19:58,630 --> 00:20:01,463
提醒我有人要来
to warn me when someone's coming,

309
00:20:01,600 --> 00:20:05,001
要我为没做过的事负责
Iooking to blame me
for things that I didn't do.

310
00:20:06,672 --> 00:20:10,472
郑重申明
你没必要那样折磨迪亚哥
For the record, you didn't
have to work Diego like that.

311
00:20:10,609 --> 00:20:12,372
我们早就该好好聊聊了
You and I are long overdue
for a chat.

312
00:20:12,511 --> 00:20:15,503
你想聊？那就聊吧
You want to talk? Talk.

313
00:20:15,647 --> 00:20:17,478
好凶啊
Tough girl.

314
00:20:17,616 --> 00:20:19,880
这点和你爸可真像
You're a lot like
your dad in that way.

315
00:20:20,719 --> 00:20:22,880
是的，我认识他
Oh, yeah. I knew him.

316
00:20:23,021 --> 00:20:24,488
我认识你所有家人
I knew your whole family.

317
00:20:24,623 --> 00:20:28,354
事实上，如果你像我一样了解他们
In fact, if you knew them like I did,

318
00:20:28,493 --> 00:20:31,394
你就知道他们到底有多少敌人了
you'd know just how many
enemies they have.

319
00:20:32,064 --> 00:20:35,431
90年代时，新月狼族
统治着这个城市
Back in the '90s, it was the Crescent
wolves who took over the city.

320
00:20:35,567 --> 00:20:37,091
或者说试图统治
Or tried to.

321
00:20:37,236 --> 00:20:39,534
他们天生擅长如此，做得也很好
They lived to throw down,
and they were good at it, too.

322
00:20:40,505 --> 00:20:44,271
只要能掌握更多的权力
他们不在乎杀死谁
They didn't care who they killed
as long as they got more power.

323
00:20:44,876 --> 00:20:48,209
所以新月族的诅咒
是你阻止他们的办法？
So the Crescent curse was
your way of stopping them?

324
00:20:48,347 --> 00:20:49,439
多英勇啊
How heroic.

325
00:20:49,581 --> 00:20:51,071
要么那样，要么就得杀了他们
It was either that or kill them all,

326
00:20:51,216 --> 00:20:53,741
我并不热衷于残忍的大屠杀
and I'm not big
on indiscriminant slaughter.

327
00:20:53,885 --> 00:20:57,013
我对孩子还是很有心的
See, I have this thing about kids.

328
00:20:57,155 --> 00:20:58,884
我听说了
So I've heard.

329
00:21:01,727 --> 00:21:05,754
你可不只是听说
安德莉亚拉柏奈
You did more than hear about it....
Andrea Labonair.

330
00:21:08,100 --> 00:21:09,692
你就是活生生的证据
You're living proof.

331
00:21:17,809 --> 00:21:21,176
他心跳停止了
你最好不要看
He's in cardiac arrest.
You might want to look away.

332
00:21:24,416 --> 00:21:27,442
- 你在干什么？
- 给他的心脏做个按摩
-What the hell are you doing?
-Massaging his heart.

333
00:21:28,787 --> 00:21:30,846
他的身体正在停止运转
His body is shutting down.

334
00:21:30,989 --> 00:21:33,150
即使有我的帮助，他也没多少时间了
Even with my help,
he doesn't have much time.

335
00:21:34,126 --> 00:21:35,684
你的血
Your blood.

336
00:21:35,827 --> 00:21:38,227
如果你喂他喝你的血
他就会醒过来，对吧？
If you fed him your blood,
he'd wake back up, right?

337
00:21:38,363 --> 00:21:40,422
是的，变成一个转变中的吸血鬼
As a vampire in transition, yes.

338
00:21:40,565 --> 00:21:42,123
至于诅咒…
As for the hex...

339
00:21:43,702 --> 00:21:46,034
也许死亡才是对他的仁慈
...perhaps his death will be a mercy.

340
00:21:49,041 --> 00:21:50,770
喂他，快点
Do it. Just do it.

341
00:21:50,909 --> 00:21:54,276
拜托，克劳斯
我不能让他这样死去
Please, Klaus, I can't let
him die, not like this.

342
00:22:28,780 --> 00:22:30,714
你知道我的真实身份多久了？
How long have you known who I am?

343
00:22:30,849 --> 00:22:33,443
我注意到你对新月狼族很感兴趣
I saw how interested you
were in those Crescents.

344
00:22:33,585 --> 00:22:36,418
你们在种植园外家庭团聚之后
After your little family reunion
out at the old plantation house,

345
00:22:36,555 --> 00:22:38,318
我就开始思考你们之间的联系
I started to put
two and two together.

346
00:22:38,457 --> 00:22:40,755
告诉我，马赛尔
Tell me something, Marcel.

347
00:22:42,728 --> 00:22:44,696
是你杀了我父母吗？
Did you kill my parents?

348
00:22:46,765 --> 00:22:49,256
狼人之间发生了冲突
There was infighting
among the wolves.

349
00:22:50,602 --> 00:22:53,833
你的家人很低调
有人攻击了他们
Your folks were laying low.
Somebody turned on them.

350
00:22:53,972 --> 00:22:55,940
说实话，我不知道是谁
I honestly don't know who.

351
00:22:56,508 --> 00:23:00,376
我之后到了那里
在你的婴儿床里发现了你
I got there afterwards,
found you in your crib.

352
00:23:00,512 --> 00:23:03,242
给我一个合理的理由，我凭什么
Give me one good reason
why I should believe

353
00:23:03,382 --> 00:23:05,612
要相信你说的话
anything that you have to say.

354
00:23:05,751 --> 00:23:09,949
信不信由你
但你是拉怕奈家族最后一个人
Believe whatever you want,
but you were the last Labonair.

355
00:23:10,088 --> 00:23:12,921
这本来可以成为我们的筹码
I mean, could've been a lot
of leverage for our side,

356
00:23:13,058 --> 00:23:15,720
但我却把你交给了基兰神父
but instead,
I took you to Father Kieran.

357
00:23:22,534 --> 00:23:24,525
那是什么？
What's that?

358
00:23:24,669 --> 00:23:26,660
主要是钱
Money mostly.

359
00:23:26,805 --> 00:23:29,330
你去安全地方重新开始所需要的东西
Stuff you need to start over
someplace safe.

360
00:23:29,941 --> 00:23:32,671
不管在河口发生了什么事
都不是我干的
Whatever happened in the
bayou, I'm not your guy,

361
00:23:32,811 --> 00:23:36,042
但照事情的发展来看
最终我也许不得不这么做
but the way things are going,
eventually, I might have to be.

362
00:23:40,318 --> 00:23:43,082
这就是你的大计划
So this is your grand plan.

363
00:23:43,221 --> 00:23:46,987
把我赶出城
克劳斯和以利亚就会紧随在后？
Get me out of town, and Klaus
and Elijah follow closely behind?

364
00:23:47,125 --> 00:23:49,992
我不能说这不会是一个积极的影响
I can't say that wouldn't
be a positive side effect.

365
00:23:50,128 --> 00:23:52,460
照你的建议，你为什么不自己离开？
So why don't you leave,
follow your own advice?

366
00:23:54,132 --> 00:23:55,793
我在这里出生，海莉
I was born here, Hayley.

367
00:23:57,102 --> 00:23:58,899
我也是
So was l.

368
00:24:06,077 --> 00:24:08,341
那个骑车放炸弹的人
Guy on the bike, the bomber....

369
00:24:08,480 --> 00:24:10,641
听说他有赌瘾
Word is, he had a gambling problem.

370
00:24:10,782 --> 00:24:12,647
欠赌场钱
Owed money to the casinos.

371
00:24:12,784 --> 00:24:15,548
更重要的是，欠那些
经营赌场的人类的钱
More importantly,
to the humans who run them.

372
00:24:15,687 --> 00:24:18,713
还有，海莉，当情况变糟时
And, Hayley, when things get bad,

373
00:24:18,857 --> 00:24:21,883
记住，我努力让你远离这一切了
remember, I tried to get
you clear of it.

374
00:24:22,027 --> 00:24:23,153
再一次
Again.

375
00:24:31,837 --> 00:24:33,805
我想我该走了
I'm afraid I have to go.

376
00:24:35,173 --> 00:24:37,835
他醒来后会怎样？
What happens next, after he wakes?

377
00:24:38,977 --> 00:24:41,172
会进入转变过程，嗜血
He'll be in transition,
craving blood,

378
00:24:41,313 --> 00:24:43,713
但我在那之前就会回来
but I'll be back before then.

379
00:24:44,583 --> 00:24:46,517
他一定会很生我的气
He's gonna be furious with me.

380
00:24:46,651 --> 00:24:49,142
他是神父，我却把他变成了吸血鬼
He's a priest.
I turned him into a vampire.

381
00:24:49,287 --> 00:24:50,914
那是怎样绝望的举动？
What kind of desperate move is that?

382
00:24:51,056 --> 00:24:55,186
你和我都清楚，亲爱的
他一定不会完成转变
Well, you know as well as I do, love,
he'll never go through with it.

383
00:24:57,729 --> 00:24:59,321
转变他并不是目的
Turning him wasn't the goal.

384
00:25:01,132 --> 00:25:03,566
是给你机会跟他道别
It was to give you a
chance to say good-bye.

385
00:25:07,172 --> 00:25:12,269
克劳斯，你能再多留一会吗？
Klaus, will you stay
just a little longer?

386
00:25:15,647 --> 00:25:17,706
当然可以
Of course.

387
00:25:43,942 --> 00:25:47,070
这就是你承诺的和平吗？
Is this the peace you promised?

388
00:25:51,750 --> 00:25:55,277
我想我弟弟认为他可以解除你们的诅咒
I gather my brother believes
he can remove your curse.

389
00:25:56,521 --> 00:25:58,352
克劳斯说要给我们自由
Klaus was offering us freedom,

390
00:25:58,490 --> 00:26:00,185
不仅是从变身的痛苦中解脱
not just from the pain
that comes with turning,

391
00:26:00,325 --> 00:26:03,522
还有我们一直以来所遭受的轻视
but from the contempt we've
faced our whole lives.

392
00:26:04,062 --> 00:26:05,859
那海莉怎么办？
And what about Hayley?

393
00:26:09,100 --> 00:26:10,829
想让这里变得适合她
Want to make this place
right for her,

394
00:26:10,969 --> 00:26:14,200
对她和孩子都安全
safe for her and the baby.

395
00:26:30,055 --> 00:26:33,582
卡蜜，发生了什么事？
Cami, what happened?

396
00:26:36,494 --> 00:26:38,394
那个诅咒…
The hex....

397
00:26:39,297 --> 00:26:44,030
我能感觉到
它活生生的在我身体里
I could feel it like a....
Iiving thing inside of me.

398
00:26:49,941 --> 00:26:51,499
它消失了
It's gone.

399
00:26:58,617 --> 00:27:00,448
我的天啊
Oh, my God.

400
00:27:03,154 --> 00:27:06,282
是的，今天对你来说很不客易，神父
Yes, you've had a trying day, father.

401
00:27:09,094 --> 00:27:11,119
要怎么跟你说呢？
How best to break it to you?

402
00:27:12,364 --> 00:27:15,424
看来诅咒随着你的死
It appears the hex was broken...

403
00:27:16,434 --> 00:27:17,662
而解除了
...by your death.

404
00:27:21,106 --> 00:27:22,733
等一下
Back up.

405
00:27:23,341 --> 00:27:24,808
我死了吗？
I died?

406
00:27:26,511 --> 00:27:28,342
死了多久？
For how long?

407
00:27:28,947 --> 00:27:31,381
大约几个小时
A few hours, give or take.

408
00:27:31,516 --> 00:27:33,279
对不起
I'm sorry.

409
00:27:33,418 --> 00:27:35,045
我不能就这样失去你
I just couldn't lose you,
not like that.

410
00:27:35,186 --> 00:27:37,916
我强迫克劳斯喂他的血给你
I made him give you his blood.

411
00:27:38,456 --> 00:27:40,117
我明白了
I see.

412
00:27:41,893 --> 00:27:44,885
我终究还是和魔鬼做了交易
So the devil has a deal
for me, after all.

413
00:27:45,063 --> 00:27:47,763
基兰叔叔，我…
-(SCOFFS)
-Uncle Kieran l....

414
00:27:49,567 --> 00:27:53,025
你的饥饿感
只会越来越强
That hunger you feel,
it'll only grow stronger.

415
00:27:53,171 --> 00:27:54,934
我知道这会怎样
I know how it works.

416
00:27:56,374 --> 00:28:00,071
那你很快就知道，如果你不喝血就会死
Then you will soon know if you
do not feed, you will die.

417
00:28:01,279 --> 00:28:04,271
我知道如果这是我必须做出的选择
I know if that's the choice that l
have to make,

418
00:28:04,416 --> 00:28:06,145
那我已经死了
I'm dead already.

419
00:28:13,091 --> 00:28:16,219
请让我跟我侄女单独待一会
Please leave me with my niece.

420
00:28:17,062 --> 00:28:19,292
我想和她单独聊聊
I'd like a private moment
to talk with her.

421
00:28:24,636 --> 00:28:26,297
没事的
It's OK.

422
00:28:27,439 --> 00:28:30,135
克劳斯，谢谢你今天所做的一切
Klaus, thank you for today.

423
00:28:31,142 --> 00:28:32,905
谢谢你的善良
For being kind.

424
00:28:50,562 --> 00:28:54,794
嘿，奥利
我看起来怎样？
Hey, Ollie. How do I look?

425
00:28:56,634 --> 00:28:59,068
很好，伊芙，你看起来很好
You look fine, Evie.
You look just fine.

426
00:28:59,204 --> 00:29:01,866
你总是不擅长说谎
You always were a terrible liar.

427
00:29:03,908 --> 00:29:05,876
该死
Damn it.

428
00:29:06,010 --> 00:29:08,171
听着，你只要触发诅咒
Look, all you got to do is
just trigger the curse.

429
00:29:08,313 --> 00:29:09,974
你就会治愈
You'll heal.

430
00:29:10,115 --> 00:29:13,676
这就是我们的天性，你的天性
It's who we are.
It's who you are.

431
00:29:13,818 --> 00:29:15,786
你为什么就不能接受呢？
Why can't you just accept that?

432
00:29:17,021 --> 00:29:19,182
为什么就没人知道该做什么呢？
Why can't anyone see
what needs to be done?

433
00:29:21,493 --> 00:29:23,757
像动物一样住在这里
部落间相互斗争
Living here like animals,
fighting between tribes,

434
00:29:23,895 --> 00:29:25,726
不敢为自己出头
scared to stand up for ourselves.

435
00:29:26,931 --> 00:29:29,923
谁要来领导我们？
杰克森吗？
Who's gonna lead us? Jackson?

436
00:29:30,068 --> 00:29:32,468
他想要屈服于那个混合种
He wants to bow down to that hybrid.

437
00:29:33,838 --> 00:29:36,568
海莉吗？她不是我们的一员
Hayley? She's not one of us.

438
00:29:39,010 --> 00:29:41,478
至少现在，我们有一个仇人了
At least now, we have
an enemy to hate.

439
00:29:42,914 --> 00:29:45,109
奥利佛，不
Oliver, no.

440
00:29:46,284 --> 00:29:48,184
- 告诉我你没有…
- 你不理解
-Tell me you didn't--
-You don't understand.

441
00:29:48,319 --> 00:29:50,287
那就解释给我听，奥利
Then explain it to me, Ollie.

442
00:29:50,421 --> 00:29:52,753
我了解你
I know you.

443
00:29:52,891 --> 00:29:55,223
我知道你不会伤害自己人
I know you wouldn't
hurt your own people.

444
00:29:56,895 --> 00:30:00,387
听着
事情不应该是这样的，伊芙
Look, it wasn't supposed to
happen like this, Evie.

445
00:30:01,432 --> 00:30:02,956
我…
I just...

446
00:30:03,101 --> 00:30:06,127
我只想制造点事端
让我们的人愤怒起来
I just wanted to make a little noise,
just get our people mad.

447
00:30:07,338 --> 00:30:09,329
但我没同意这些
But I didn't agree to all this.

448
00:30:09,474 --> 00:30:11,339
他们在背后搞鬼，现在…
They stabbed me in the back,
and now you're--

449
00:30:11,476 --> 00:30:14,604
谁？是谁唆使你的？
Who? Who put you up to this?

450
00:30:17,949 --> 00:30:21,180
你这个蠢孩子
You stupid kid.

451
00:30:22,086 --> 00:30:23,451
你知道狼群发现后
Do you have any idea

452
00:30:23,588 --> 00:30:26,352
会怎么处置你吗？
what the pack's gonna
do to you when they find out?

453
00:30:35,767 --> 00:30:37,564
他们不会发现的，伊芙
They're not gonna find out, Evie.

454
00:30:38,303 --> 00:30:39,861
如果发现了
If they did...

455
00:30:41,172 --> 00:30:43,606
那些人就白死了
...all those people
would have died in vain.

456
00:30:43,741 --> 00:30:47,871
我不得不，不惜一切代价
I had to do whatever it took...

457
00:30:49,314 --> 00:30:51,214
让我们强大起来
...to make us strong.

458
00:30:51,349 --> 00:30:53,840
- 奥利，不要
- 即使现在我也不得不这么做
-Ollie, no.
-And I've got to do that even now.

459
00:30:53,985 --> 00:30:56,681
奥利
奥利佛，不要
Ollie. Oliver, no.

460
00:30:57,355 --> 00:30:59,880
不，不，奥利
No! No! Ollie!

461
00:31:00,024 --> 00:31:01,423
对不起，伊芙
I'm sorry, Eve.

462
00:31:09,267 --> 00:31:11,064
所有东西都在你说的地方
Everything is where
you said it would be

463
00:31:11,202 --> 00:31:14,194
除了你提到的钥匙
只有那个我没找到
except that key you mentioned.
That's the one thing I couldn't find.

464
00:31:14,339 --> 00:31:16,705
是不是你经常挂在脖子上的那把？
It's the one you usually
wear around your neck?

465
00:31:16,841 --> 00:31:19,901
钥匙是我们家族传承的重要一部分
That key is a very important
part of our family legacy.

466
00:31:20,044 --> 00:31:21,807
你必须找到它
You have to find it.

467
00:31:21,946 --> 00:31:25,109
我会的，我保证
I will, I promise.

468
00:31:32,423 --> 00:31:35,187
真对不起
I am so sorry.

469
00:31:35,960 --> 00:31:39,225
我从没想过要把你牵扯进来
牵扯进这一切
I never wanted to involve
you in this, in any of it.

470
00:31:41,499 --> 00:31:44,332
一定不会就这样结束
This can't be how it ends.

471
00:31:44,469 --> 00:31:47,131
这是唯一结束的办法
It was the only way
it was ever going to end.

472
00:31:48,439 --> 00:31:50,634
我很久之前就接受了
I made peace with that
a long time ago.

473
00:31:57,615 --> 00:31:59,480
听着
Listen.

474
00:31:59,617 --> 00:32:03,519
我不知道情况会变得多糟
I don't know how bad
this is gonna get,

475
00:32:03,655 --> 00:32:06,055
我不想让你看到
and I don't want you to see it.

476
00:32:07,926 --> 00:32:11,123
所以一会儿，我会放手
So in a moment, I'm gonna let go,

477
00:32:11,262 --> 00:32:14,663
你就转身
and you are gonna turn around,

478
00:32:14,799 --> 00:32:17,996
离开这里，不要回头
and you are gonna walk out of
here without looking back.

479
00:32:21,239 --> 00:32:22,797
好吗，孩子？
OK, kiddo?

480
00:32:23,808 --> 00:32:25,503
答应我
Promise me.

481
00:32:27,412 --> 00:32:28,936
不要回头
Without looking back.

482
00:32:48,700 --> 00:32:50,861
他们希望我们心存怀疑
OLlVER: They are counting
on our doubts.

483
00:32:51,002 --> 00:32:52,867
- 没错  - 对
-That's right!
-Yeah!

484
00:32:53,004 --> 00:32:55,199
他们希望我们心存恐惧
They are counting on our fears!

485
00:32:55,340 --> 00:32:57,205
- 没错  - 对
-That's right!
-Right!

486
00:32:57,342 --> 00:32:58,741
你没走
You stayed.

487
00:32:58,876 --> 00:33:02,710
明天一早，他们就知道
我们不是懦夫
Come morning, they will
know that we are not cowards.

488
00:33:02,847 --> 00:33:04,815
怎么回事？他在干什么？
What's going on?
What is he doing?

489
00:33:04,949 --> 00:33:06,109
我们无所畏惧
We are not afraid!

490
00:33:06,250 --> 00:33:09,481
他在利用悲剧的发生获得权力
He's making a move for power
in the wake of tragedy.

491
00:33:09,620 --> 00:33:11,212
他不是一个人
He's not alone.

492
00:33:11,356 --> 00:33:13,381
你走之后又有一次攻击
There was another attack
after you left.

493
00:33:13,524 --> 00:33:14,923
什么？
What?

494
00:33:22,400 --> 00:33:24,595
你的朋友杰克森需要你的帮助
ELlJAH: Your friend Jackson
will need your help.

495
00:33:27,171 --> 00:33:29,196
他们会想要复仇
They will want vengeance.

496
00:33:34,078 --> 00:33:36,205
血债血偿
Blood for blood.

497
00:33:38,950 --> 00:33:41,441
不幸的是，在困境中
And, unfortunately,
in troubled times,

498
00:33:41,586 --> 00:33:43,315
人们不会听从最优秀的人
people do not look for the best.

499
00:33:44,155 --> 00:33:46,680
而会选择喊得最响的人
But rather, the loudest.

500
00:33:46,791 --> 00:33:47,780
没错
Yeah!

501
00:34:18,022 --> 00:34:19,990
我很惊讶会在这里看到你
I'm surprised to see you here.

502
00:34:20,124 --> 00:34:25,426
河口的爆炸
对我孩子的攻击
The bayou explosion,
the attack on my child.

503
00:34:25,563 --> 00:34:27,531
告诉我你所知道的
Tell me what you know.

504
00:34:28,533 --> 00:34:31,764
我知道狼人不缺敌人
I know the wolves have
no shortage of enemies.

505
00:34:31,903 --> 00:34:34,531
- 马赛尔就是其中之一
- 马赛尔不会堕落到如此地步
-Marcel, for one.
-Marcel wouldn't stoop so low.

506
00:34:34,672 --> 00:34:36,970
然而女巫…
The witches, however....

507
00:34:38,009 --> 00:34:41,445
我已亲眼见识到你们的残忍
I have witnessed firsthand
the depths of your cruelty.

508
00:34:41,579 --> 00:34:43,706
你不会以为是我干的吧
You don't think I did this.

509
00:34:45,183 --> 00:34:47,549
你把我当成什么样的怪物了？
What kind of monster
do you take me for?

510
00:34:51,055 --> 00:34:53,523
和你那纯洁无辜的宝贝卡蜜儿相比
How ugly I must seem
next to the pure,

511
00:34:53,658 --> 00:34:56,183
我一定非常丑陋不堪
innocent glow of
your precious Camille.

512
00:34:57,228 --> 00:35:00,527
对了，真为她叔叔难过
So sad about her uncle, by the way.

513
00:35:01,799 --> 00:35:05,291
基兰正在转变过程中
Kieran is in transition.

514
00:35:05,436 --> 00:35:08,371
他已经从诅咒中解脱
He has been released from the hex.

515
00:35:20,384 --> 00:35:22,750
那么强大的诅咒吗？
GENEVlEVE: A hex
of that magnitude?

516
00:35:23,588 --> 00:35:25,419
基兰的诅咒还会再出现
Kieran's hex will return...

517
00:35:27,525 --> 00:35:29,584
迟早的事
...if it hasn't already.

518
00:35:41,706 --> 00:35:44,641
神父
-No!
-Not yet, priest.

519
00:35:45,610 --> 00:35:47,339
还有任务要做
There's more work to be done.

520
00:35:49,046 --> 00:35:53,244
完成你苦行的最后一件事
A final offering
to complete your penance,

521
00:35:53,384 --> 00:35:57,184
献上你最亲爱的人
that which you hold most dear.

522
00:36:01,726 --> 00:36:03,990
另一方面，那个边界咒语
GENEVlEVE: That boundary spell,
on the other hand,

523
00:36:04,128 --> 00:36:06,619
既然他死了
now that he's died,

524
00:36:06,764 --> 00:36:10,427
我想那就不会再有效了
I imagine it won't be
quite so confining anymore.

525
00:36:49,040 --> 00:36:51,167
你改变主意了吗？
Have you changed your mind?

526
00:36:51,309 --> 00:36:55,439
是的，显然是
Yes. It appears I have.

527
00:37:27,712 --> 00:37:29,202
不要挣托了，卡蜜
-Don't fight it, Cami.
-(SCREAMlNG)

528
00:37:34,485 --> 00:37:37,010
死亡让我们完整
In death, we are whole again.

529
00:37:43,294 --> 00:37:44,886
祝福她，神父
Bless her, Father.

530
00:37:46,197 --> 00:37:47,858
杀了她
Kill her.

531
00:37:47,999 --> 00:37:49,489
享受生命的永恒
Rejoice in life eternal.

532
00:38:01,779 --> 00:38:04,270
你不该承受这些的
You deserved far better than this.

533
00:38:34,812 --> 00:38:36,575
克劳斯，你要知道今天河口的事情
Klaus, you need to know
I had nothing to do

534
00:38:36,714 --> 00:38:38,113
和我毫无关系
with that business
out in the bayou today.

535
00:38:38,249 --> 00:38:39,910
我从不觉得是你干的
KLAUS: I never thought you did.

536
00:38:41,018 --> 00:38:43,987
我打电话是要告诉你神父死了
I'm calling to let you
know the priest is dead.

537
00:38:47,058 --> 00:38:50,926
你的驱逐暂停24小时
Your exile is suspended
for the next 24 hours.

538
00:38:51,062 --> 00:38:53,826
你可以回法语区来埋葬你的朋友
You may return to the
Quarter to bury your friend.

539
00:38:55,132 --> 00:38:56,724
你为什么这么做？
Why are you doing this?

540
00:38:58,202 --> 00:39:01,694
她在黑暗中醒来
She woke in the dark,

541
00:39:01,839 --> 00:39:03,898
不知身在何处
not knowing where she was...

542
00:39:06,510 --> 00:39:08,671
不知道是谁在守护她
...or who was watching over her.

543
00:39:11,816 --> 00:39:16,753
她呼唤的是你的名字
如果你能给她安慰
It was your name she called,
and if you can grant her comfort...

544
00:39:17,955 --> 00:39:19,286
那就这么做吧
...so be it.

545
00:39:39,143 --> 00:39:41,111
听着，我知道我要去哪
OLlVER: Look.
I know where I'm going.

546
00:39:41,245 --> 00:39:45,045
如果你们有人想跟随，请便
If any of you want to follow,
hey, that's up to you.

547
00:39:45,549 --> 00:39:47,141
你们自己决定
-That's up to you!
-(CROWD SHOUTlNG)

548
00:39:58,095 --> 00:39:59,722
基兰死了
Kieran's dead.

549
00:40:02,266 --> 00:40:03,528
你拿到了吗？
Did you get it?

550
00:40:09,473 --> 00:40:12,271
如你所说，就在他的脖子上
It was around his neck,
just like you said.

551
00:40:14,211 --> 00:40:16,406
另外，我对此感觉并不好
PS, I do not feel
awesome about this.

552
00:40:16,547 --> 00:40:17,639
我知道
I know.

553
00:40:19,116 --> 00:40:21,084
但人们会争夺这个
But people are
gonna be coming after this.

554
00:40:21,218 --> 00:40:22,810
卡蜜还没准备好
Cami is not ready for that, not yet.

555
00:40:22,953 --> 00:40:25,114
那现在怎么办？
So what now?

556
00:40:26,090 --> 00:40:27,921
乌云聚集
Storm clouds are gathering.

557
00:40:28,058 --> 00:40:30,424
有人用炸药炸了狼人
我们知道不是我们干的
Someone bombed those wolves,
and we know it wasn't us.

558
00:40:32,029 --> 00:40:36,989
女巫、人类
吸血鬼、狼人
Witches, humans, vampires, wolves.

559
00:40:39,870 --> 00:40:41,735
城市就在暴风边缘
City is at a breaking point.

560
00:40:48,045 --> 00:40:49,808
我们要做好准备
We need to be ready.

561
00:40:52,216 --> 00:40:56,516
先是马赛尔的大屠杀
然后又是河口的炸弹
First Marcel's massacre,
now bombs in the bayou.

562
00:40:56,654 --> 00:41:00,590
我想你准备放弃
这个注定失败的协定了吧
I'll assume you're ready to
give up this doomed treaty.

563
00:41:01,892 --> 00:41:04,053
与狼人的结盟
This alliance with the wolves....

564
00:41:04,195 --> 00:41:08,188
如果要成功
我想你需要这个
If it is to succeed,
I believe you'll want this.

565
00:41:11,535 --> 00:41:15,369
我想我得谢谢海莉让你改变心意
I suppose I have Hayley
to thank for your change of heart.

566
00:41:16,340 --> 00:41:20,436
这城市的裂痕远比我想的还要严重
尼克劳斯
The rifts in this city run far deeper
than I even imagined, Niklaus.

567
00:41:22,947 --> 00:41:26,383
这些部落，这些派系
他们是家人
These tribes, these
factions, they're families,

568
00:41:26,517 --> 00:41:28,314
选择斗争的家人
and families will choose to fight.

569
00:41:30,754 --> 00:41:33,587
我们的家园已一片混乱
Mayhem has descended upon our home,

570
00:41:33,724 --> 00:41:35,749
如果要我选择
and if I'm to choose a side....

571
00:41:42,433 --> 00:41:44,264
敬我们的胜利，弟弟
To our victory, brother.

572
00:41:51,342 --> 00:41:56,006
