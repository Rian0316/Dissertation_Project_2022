Hayley: Kill him.

00:00:02,614 --> 00:00:06,650
If we can't all create some sort of
community, then what's the point?

4
00:00:06,651 --> 00:00:08,731

and get it all over with.

Elijah: If there
is no peace between us,

6
00:00:10,100 --> 00:00:12,554
then how can you expect
others to follow suit?

7
00:00:12,720 --> 00:00:15,938
Klaus: The city's inhabitants will
not adhere to this agreement.

8
00:00:15,939 --> 00:00:19,353
We have a message for Marcel Girard.

You and I were betrothed.

I guess that makes us
kind of like royalty.

11
00:00:22,779 --> 00:00:25,646
We made an alliance that's gonna
change everything for the wolves.

werewolves from the curse.

I don't know how long I have.

Cami: The pills, they're not working.

17
00:00:35,358 --> 00:00:37,159
Klaus: These hexes,
they start with magic.

18
00:00:37,160 --> 00:00:39,331
They alter the very
chemistry of the brain.

preserve my soul in life everlasting.

a little late for that, father.

This city is full of monsters.

Uh, yeah.
Trust me, I know.

It was just for a

I don't know, Cami.

I mean, maybe he's still in
there underneath all the crazy,

00:02:47,124 --> 00:02:50,170
but the crazy is pretty thick.

50
00:02:50,336 --> 00:02:53,727
Maybe he just needs
a shock to his system,

Yes. In fact, I believe you can.

most powerful spells.

It appears to have been misplaced.

How very mysterious.
Indeed.

61

if the thief wasn't
a bit closer to home.

Don't make this harder
than it needs to be, brother.

68
00:03:58,225 --> 00:04:02,829
Well, admittedly, I did have a
theory that your sudden interest

00:04:02,830 --> 00:04:05,732
in mother's grimoire was in some way
related to whatever foolishness

Yes, unless, of course, they decide
to seek retribution for decades

357
00:19:20,071 --> 00:19:21,639
We don't even know who's to blame.

358
00:19:21,640 --> 00:19:23,374
The hell we don't,

359
00:19:23,375 --> 00:19:25,623
and if we don't fight back,
they'll just do it again.

360
00:19:43,427 --> 00:19:46,363
Come on in.

361
00:19:46,364 --> 00:19:47,645
Have a seat.

362
00:19:47,811 --> 00:19:50,567
I'd offer you a drink, but...

363
00:19:50,568 --> 00:19:51,899
Sweet pad.

364
00:19:52,065 --> 00:19:53,737
Oh, it's just temporary.

365
00:19:53,738 --> 00:19:55,152
Friend hooked me up.

366
00:19:55,318 --> 00:19:58,108
Believe it or not, I still got
a few of those kicking around.

367
00:19:58,109 --> 00:20:03,413
I need friends to keep me informed,
to warn me when someone is coming

368
00:20:03,414 --> 00:20:08,217
looking to blame me for
things that I didn't do.

369
00:20:08,707 --> 00:20:12,589
For the record, you didn't
have to work Diego like that.

370
00:20:12,590 --> 00:20:14,380
You and I are long overdue for a chat.

371
00:20:14,546 --> 00:20:17,461
You want to talk, talk.

372
00:20:17,462 --> 00:20:19,429
Tough girl.

373
00:20:19,430 --> 00:20:21,898
You're a lot like
your dad in that way.

374
00:20:21,899 --> 00:20:24,935
Oh, yeah.
I knew him.

375
00:20:24,936 --> 00:20:26,517
I knew your whole family.

376
00:20:26,683 --> 00:20:30,240
In fact, if you knew them like I did,

377
00:20:30,241 --> 00:20:33,276
you'd know just how many
enemies they have.

378
00:20:33,277 --> 00:20:35,544
Back in the nineties, it was

379
00:20:35,546 --> 00:20:38,081
the crescent wolves
who took over the city.

380
00:20:38,082 --> 00:20:42,252
They lived to throw down, and
they were good at it, too.

381
00:20:42,253 --> 00:20:46,162
They didn't care who they killed
as long as they got more power.

382
00:20:46,724 --> 00:20:50,193
So the crescent curse was
your way of stopping them?

383
00:20:50,194 --> 00:20:51,594
How heroic.

384
00:20:51,595 --> 00:20:54,397
It was either that or kill
them all, and I'm not big

385
00:20:54,398 --> 00:20:55,899
on indiscriminant slaughter.

386
00:20:55,900 --> 00:20:59,169
See, I have this thing about kids.

387
00:20:59,170 --> 00:21:01,770
So I've heard.

388
00:21:02,260 --> 00:21:03,506
Oh...

389
00:21:03,507 --> 00:21:06,042
You did more than hear about it,

390
00:21:06,043 --> 00:21:07,683
Andrea Labonair.

391
00:21:09,976 --> 00:21:12,271
You're living proof.

392
00:21:15,018 --> 00:21:18,521
[EKG beeping rapidly]

393
00:21:18,522 --> 00:21:20,123
[Flatline beep]

394
00:21:20,124 --> 00:21:23,073
He's in cardiac arrest.
You might want to look away.

395
00:21:26,095 --> 00:21:28,297
What the hell are you doing?

396
00:21:28,298 --> 00:21:30,533
Massaging his heart.

397
00:21:30,534 --> 00:21:32,875
His body is shutting down.

398
00:21:33,041 --> 00:21:35,972
Even with my help, he
doesn't have much time.

399
00:21:35,973 --> 00:21:37,573
Your blood.

400
00:21:37,574 --> 00:21:40,176
If you fed him your blood,
he'd wake back up, right?

401
00:21:40,177 --> 00:21:42,426
As a vampire in transition, yes.

402
00:21:42,592 --> 00:21:47,850
As for the hex, perhaps his
death will be a mercy.

403
00:21:47,851 --> 00:21:50,820
[EKG beeping rapidly]

404
00:21:50,821 --> 00:21:52,821
Do it. Just do it.

405
00:21:52,823 --> 00:21:57,325
Please, Klaus, I can't let
him die, not like this.

406
00:22:18,714 --> 00:22:21,382
[Flatline beep]

407
00:22:32,944 --> 00:22:34,445
How long have you known who I am?

408
00:22:34,446 --> 00:22:37,114
I saw how interested you
were in those crescents.

409
00:22:37,115 --> 00:22:40,084
After your little family reunion
out at the old plantation house,

410
00:22:40,085 --> 00:22:41,944
I started to put two and two together.

411
00:22:42,110 --> 00:22:44,354
Tell me something, Marcel.

412
00:22:45,956 --> 00:22:48,242
Did you kill my parents?

413
00:22:50,294 --> 00:22:52,913
There was infighting among the wolves.

414
00:22:53,079 --> 00:22:55,666
Your folks were laying low.

415
00:22:55,832 --> 00:22:57,601
Somebody turned on them.

416
00:22:57,602 --> 00:23:00,103
I honestly don't know who.

417
00:23:00,105 --> 00:23:04,174
I got there afterwards,
found you in your crib.

418
00:23:04,175 --> 00:23:06,610
Give me one good reason
why I should believe

419
00:23:06,611 --> 00:23:09,138
anything that you have to say.

420
00:23:09,304 --> 00:23:13,717
Believe whatever you want, but
you were the last Labonair.

421
00:23:13,718 --> 00:23:16,687
I mean, could've been a lot
of leverage for our side,

422
00:23:16,688 --> 00:23:19,355
but instead, I took you
to father Kieran.

423
00:23:26,130 --> 00:23:28,165
What's that?

424
00:23:28,166 --> 00:23:33,504
Money mostly, stuff you need
to start over someplace safe.

425
00:23:33,505 --> 00:23:36,340
Whatever happened in the
bayou, I'm not your guy,

426
00:23:36,341 --> 00:23:39,585
but the way things are going,
eventually, I might have to be.

427
00:23:43,947 --> 00:23:48,385
So this is your grand plan...
Get me out of town,

428
00:23:48,386 --> 00:23:50,787
and Klaus and Elijah
follow closely behind?

429
00:23:50,788 --> 00:23:53,724
I can't say that wouldn't
be a positive side effect.

430
00:23:53,725 --> 00:23:56,060
So why don't you leave,
follow your own advice?

431
00:23:56,527 --> 00:23:59,996
I was born here, Hayley.

432
00:23:59,997 --> 00:24:03,432
So was I.

433
00:24:08,696 --> 00:24:14,244
Guy on the bike, the bomber, word
is, he had a gambling problem,

434
00:24:14,245 --> 00:24:16,246
owed money to the casinos,

435
00:24:16,247 --> 00:24:18,682
more importantly, to
the humans who run them,

436
00:24:18,683 --> 00:24:22,352
and, Hayley, when things get bad,

437
00:24:22,353 --> 00:24:26,673
remember, I tried to get
you clear of it... again.

438
00:24:35,298 --> 00:24:38,701
I'm afraid I have to go.

439
00:24:38,702 --> 00:24:41,313
What happens next, after he wakes?

440
00:24:41,479 --> 00:24:47,310
He'll be in transition, craving
blood, but I'll be back before then.

441
00:24:47,311 --> 00:24:50,155
He's gonna be furious with me.

442
00:24:50,321 --> 00:24:52,849
He's a priest.
I turned him into a vampire.

443
00:24:52,850 --> 00:24:54,576
What kind of desperate move is that?

444
00:24:54,742 --> 00:24:58,705
Well, you know as well as I do, luv,
he'll never go through with it.

445
00:25:01,290 --> 00:25:02,876
Turning him wasn't the goal.

446
00:25:04,794 --> 00:25:07,162
It was to give you a
chance to say good-bye.

447
00:25:10,686 --> 00:25:15,804
Klaus, will you stay
just a little longer?

448
00:25:19,008 --> 00:25:20,575
Of course.

449
00:25:47,587 --> 00:25:50,591
Is this the peace you promised?

450
00:25:55,077 --> 00:25:59,475
I gather my brother believes
he can remove your curse.

451
00:25:59,641 --> 00:26:01,984
Klaus was offering us freedom

452
00:26:01,985 --> 00:26:03,786
not just from the pain
that comes with turning,

453
00:26:03,787 --> 00:26:07,456
but from the contempt we've
faced our whole lives.

454
00:26:07,457 --> 00:26:09,359
And what about Hayley?

455
00:26:12,028 --> 00:26:17,899
Want to make this place right for
her, safe for her and the baby.

456
00:26:33,415 --> 00:26:37,418
Cami, what happened?

457
00:26:39,354 --> 00:26:41,822
The hex...

458
00:26:42,824 --> 00:26:47,395
I could feel it like a
living thing inside of me.

459
00:26:53,235 --> 00:26:55,537
It's gone.

460
00:26:55,538 --> 00:26:56,904
Oh...

461
00:27:02,286 --> 00:27:04,245
Oh, my God.

462
00:27:06,514 --> 00:27:10,117
Yes. You've had a trying day, father.

463
00:27:11,686 --> 00:27:14,856
How best to break it to you?

464
00:27:15,748 --> 00:27:21,329
It appears the hex was
broken by your death.

465
00:27:23,932 --> 00:27:28,035
Back up. I died?

466
00:27:29,904 --> 00:27:32,207
For how long?

467
00:27:32,208 --> 00:27:35,176
A few hours, give or take.

468
00:27:35,177 --> 00:27:36,811
I'm sorry.

469
00:27:36,812 --> 00:27:39,347
I just couldn't lose
you, not like that.

470
00:27:39,348 --> 00:27:42,317
I made Klaus give you his blood.

471
00:27:42,318 --> 00:27:45,119
I see.

472
00:27:45,120 --> 00:27:48,417
So the devil has a deal
for me, after all.

473
00:27:49,721 --> 00:27:51,795
Uncle Kieran...

474
00:27:51,961 --> 00:27:56,730
That hunger you feel,
it'll only grow stronger.

475
00:27:56,732 --> 00:27:59,886
I know how it works.

476
00:28:00,052 --> 00:28:04,572
Then you will soon know if you
do not feed, you will die.

477
00:28:04,573 --> 00:28:10,572
I know if that's the choice that I
have to make, I'm dead already.

478
00:28:16,317 --> 00:28:20,620
Please leave me with my niece.

479
00:28:20,622 --> 00:28:22,989
I'd like a private moment
to talk with her.

480
00:28:27,995 --> 00:28:30,765
It's ok.

481
00:28:30,766 --> 00:28:36,765
Klaus, thank you for
today, for being kind.

482
00:28:48,382 --> 00:28:50,483
[Eve moaning]

483
00:28:53,887 --> 00:28:58,458
Hey, Ollie, how do I look?

484
00:28:59,960 --> 00:29:02,695
You look fine, Evie.
You look just fine.

485
00:29:02,697 --> 00:29:05,565
You always were a terrible liar.

486
00:29:07,034 --> 00:29:09,581
Damn it. Look.

487
00:29:09,747 --> 00:29:11,538
All you got to do is
just trigger the curse.

488
00:29:11,539 --> 00:29:13,307
You'll heal.

489
00:29:13,308 --> 00:29:17,214
It's who we are.
It's who you are.

490
00:29:17,380 --> 00:29:19,378
Why can't you just accept that?

491
00:29:19,380 --> 00:29:22,882
Why can't anyone see
what needs to be done?

492
00:29:25,179 --> 00:29:27,391
Living here like animals,
fighting between tribes,

493
00:29:27,557 --> 00:29:29,935
scared to stand up for ourselves.

494
00:29:30,101 --> 00:29:33,727
Who's gonna lead us, Jackson?

495
00:29:33,728 --> 00:29:36,108
He wants to bow down to that hybrid.

496
00:29:36,274 --> 00:29:40,266
Hayley?
She's not one of us.

497
00:29:42,697 --> 00:29:46,072
At least now, we have
an enemy to hate.

498
00:29:46,678 --> 00:29:52,249
Oliver, no. Tell me you didn't...
You don't understand.

499
00:29:52,415 --> 00:29:54,414
Then explain it to me, Ollie.

500
00:29:54,415 --> 00:29:56,461
I know you.

501
00:29:56,627 --> 00:29:58,884
I know you wouldn't
hurt your own people.

502
00:29:58,886 --> 00:30:01,187
Look.

503
00:30:01,188 --> 00:30:04,010
It wasn't supposed to
happen like this, Evie.

504
00:30:05,026 --> 00:30:09,683
I just wanted to make a little
noise, just get our people mad,

505
00:30:10,598 --> 00:30:13,099
but I didn't agree to all this.

506
00:30:13,100 --> 00:30:18,237
They stabbed me in the back, and now...
Who? Who put you up to this?

507
00:30:21,474 --> 00:30:25,845
You stupid kid.

508
00:30:25,846 --> 00:30:27,614
Do you have any idea
what the pack is gonna

509
00:30:27,615 --> 00:30:29,870
do to you when they find out?

510
00:30:37,590 --> 00:30:41,828
They're not gonna find out, Evie.

511
00:30:41,829 --> 00:30:47,220
If they did, all those people
would have died in vain.

512
00:30:47,701 --> 00:30:53,700
I had to do whatever it
took to make us strong.

513
00:30:55,019 --> 00:30:56,309
Ollie, no.

514
00:30:56,310 --> 00:30:57,677
I've got to do that even now.

515
00:30:57,678 --> 00:31:01,151
Ollie, it's all over now.

516
00:31:01,317 --> 00:31:03,716
No! No! Oh! Ollie!

517
00:31:03,717 --> 00:31:05,117
I'm sorry, Eve.

518
00:31:05,118 --> 00:31:06,985
Mmph mmph!

519
00:31:14,316 --> 00:31:16,685
Everything is where
you said it would be

520
00:31:16,686 --> 00:31:18,254
except that key you mentioned.

521
00:31:18,255 --> 00:31:19,822
That's the one thing I couldn't find.

522
00:31:19,823 --> 00:31:21,856
It's the one you usually
wear around your neck?

523
00:31:22,421 --> 00:31:25,461
That key is a very important
part of our family legacy.

524
00:31:25,462 --> 00:31:27,329
You have to find it.

525
00:31:27,330 --> 00:31:30,531
I will, I promise.

526
00:31:35,070 --> 00:31:37,306
[Exhales]

527
00:31:37,307 --> 00:31:41,343
I am so sorry.

528
00:31:41,344 --> 00:31:45,111
I never wanted to involve
you in this, in any of it.

529
00:31:46,982 --> 00:31:49,851
This can't be how it ends.

530
00:31:49,852 --> 00:31:52,702
It was the only way
it was ever going to end.

531
00:31:52,868 --> 00:31:56,081
I made peace with that
a long time ago.

532
00:32:02,230 --> 00:32:04,566
Listen.

533
00:32:04,567 --> 00:32:08,036
I don't know how bad
this is gonna get,

534
00:32:08,037 --> 00:32:13,374
and I don't want you to see it.

535
00:32:13,375 --> 00:32:19,374
So in a moment, I'm gonna let go,
and you are gonna turn around,

536
00:32:20,074 --> 00:32:23,608
and you are gonna walk out of
here without looking back...

537
00:32:26,721 --> 00:32:29,090
Ok, kiddo?

538
00:32:29,091 --> 00:32:34,261
Promise me, without looking back.

539
00:32:54,182 --> 00:32:56,284
Oliver: They are counting
on our doubts.

540
00:32:56,285 --> 00:32:58,051
That's right!
Yeah!

541
00:32:58,601 --> 00:33:00,722
They are counting on our fears!

542
00:33:00,723 --> 00:33:02,647
That's right!
Right!

543
00:33:02,813 --> 00:33:04,125
You stayed.

544
00:33:04,126 --> 00:33:08,278
Oliver: Come morning, they will
know that we are not cowards.

545
00:33:08,444 --> 00:33:10,131
What's going on?
What is he doing?

546
00:33:10,132 --> 00:33:11,865
We are not afraid!

547
00:33:12,031 --> 00:33:15,169
He's making a move for power
in the wake of tragedy.

548
00:33:15,170 --> 00:33:16,786
He's not alone.

549
00:33:16,952 --> 00:33:18,906
There was another attack
after you left.

550
00:33:18,907 --> 00:33:20,707
What?

551
00:33:27,963 --> 00:33:29,983
Elijah: Your friend Jackson
will need your help.

552
00:33:32,453 --> 00:33:35,155
They will want vengeance...

553
00:33:38,693 --> 00:33:41,686
Blood for blood...

554
00:33:44,165 --> 00:33:46,333
And, unfortunately, in troubled times,

555
00:33:46,334 --> 00:33:48,469
people do not look for the best...

556
00:33:48,470 --> 00:33:50,871
[Cheering]

557
00:33:50,872 --> 00:33:52,948
But rather the loudest.

558
00:33:53,114 --> 00:33:54,741
Oliver: Hey! Hey!

559
00:34:23,203 --> 00:34:25,672
I'm surprised to see you here.

560
00:34:25,673 --> 00:34:30,860
The bayou explosion, the
attack on my child.

561
00:34:31,379 --> 00:34:33,814
Tell me what you know.

562
00:34:33,815 --> 00:34:38,827
I know the wolves have no shortage
of enemies, Marcel for one.

563
00:34:38,993 --> 00:34:40,487
Marcel wouldn't stoop so low.

564
00:34:40,488 --> 00:34:42,998
The witches, however...

565
00:34:43,164 --> 00:34:47,002
I have witnessed firsthand
the depths of your cruelty.

566
00:34:47,168 --> 00:34:49,630
You don't think I did this.

567
00:34:49,631 --> 00:34:52,966
What kind of monster
do you take me for?

568
00:34:55,718 --> 00:34:58,972
How ugly I must seem next to the pure,

569
00:34:58,973 --> 00:35:02,409
innocent glow of
your precious Camille.

570
00:35:02,410 --> 00:35:05,778
So sad about her uncle, by the way.

571
00:35:07,247 --> 00:35:10,684
Kieran is in transition.

572
00:35:10,685 --> 00:35:13,820
He has been released from the hex.

573
00:35:25,031 --> 00:35:28,334
Genevieve: A hex of that magnitude?

574
00:35:28,500 --> 00:35:31,904
Kieran's hex will return...

575
00:35:33,073 --> 00:35:35,050
If it hasn't already.

576
00:35:47,153 --> 00:35:48,621
No!

577
00:35:48,622 --> 00:35:51,124
Bastianna: Not yet, priest.

578
00:35:51,125 --> 00:35:53,927
There's more work to be done,

579
00:35:53,928 --> 00:35:57,964
a final offering to
complete your penance,

580
00:35:57,965 --> 00:36:02,619
that which you hold most dear.

581
00:36:05,338 --> 00:36:07,040
[Creak]

582
00:36:07,206 --> 00:36:09,542
Genevieve: That boundary
spell, on the other hand,

583
00:36:09,708 --> 00:36:15,882
now that he's died, I imagine it
won't be quite so confining anymore.

584
00:36:48,422 --> 00:36:51,557
[Sniffles]

585
00:36:56,029 --> 00:36:58,865
Have you changed your mind?

586
00:36:58,866 --> 00:37:03,068
Yes. It appears I have.

587
00:37:08,575 --> 00:37:10,228
Oh!

588
00:37:10,394 --> 00:37:12,077
Aah!

589
00:37:18,351 --> 00:37:20,085
[Whimpering]

590
00:37:22,222 --> 00:37:23,922
Aah!

591
00:37:35,268 --> 00:37:36,401
Don't fight it, Cami.

592
00:37:36,403 --> 00:37:37,380
Aah!

593
00:37:41,941 --> 00:37:44,470
In death, we are whole again.

594
00:37:44,636 --> 00:37:45,722
Ah! Aah!

595
00:37:50,809 --> 00:37:53,652
Bastianna: Bless her, father.

596
00:37:53,654 --> 00:37:55,420
Kill her.

597
00:37:55,422 --> 00:37:56,941
Rejoice in life eternal.

598
00:37:57,107 --> 00:37:58,151
[Hiss]

599
00:37:58,317 --> 00:38:00,111
[Crack]

600
00:38:08,702 --> 00:38:11,706
You deserved far better than this.

601
00:38:13,673 --> 00:38:15,919
Uh!

602
00:38:17,577 --> 00:38:20,131
[Music playing]

603
00:38:34,493 --> 00:38:36,861
[Cell phone ringing]

604
00:38:41,267 --> 00:38:42,601
[Beep]

605
00:38:42,602 --> 00:38:44,003
Klaus, you need to know
I had nothing to do

606
00:38:44,004 --> 00:38:45,905
with that business
out in the bayou today.

607
00:38:45,906 --> 00:38:48,374
Klaus, on phone:
I never thought you did.

608
00:38:48,375 --> 00:38:52,510
I'm calling to let you
know the priest is dead.

609
00:38:54,373 --> 00:38:58,417
Your exile is suspended
for the next 24 hours.

610
00:38:58,418 --> 00:39:01,256
You may return to the
quarter to bury your friend.

611
00:39:02,521 --> 00:39:05,190
Why are you doing this?

612
00:39:05,687 --> 00:39:11,190
She woke in the dark not
knowing where she was...

613
00:39:14,101 --> 00:39:16,479
Or who was watching over her.

614
00:39:18,270 --> 00:39:24,269
It was your name she called, and
if you can grant her comfort,

615
00:39:25,245 --> 00:39:26,656
so be it.

616
00:39:45,197 --> 00:39:48,600
Oliver: Look.
I know where I'm going.

617
00:39:48,601 --> 00:39:52,938
If any of you want to follow,
hey, that's up to you.

618
00:39:52,939 --> 00:39:54,439
That's up to you!

619
00:39:54,440 --> 00:39:57,979
[Cheering]

620
00:40:05,517 --> 00:40:08,072
Kieran is dead.

621
00:40:09,688 --> 00:40:10,908
Did you get it?

622
00:40:16,828 --> 00:40:19,596
It was around his neck,
just like you said.

623
00:40:21,666 --> 00:40:24,005
P.S.... I do not feel
awesome about this.

624
00:40:24,171 --> 00:40:28,506
I know... But people are
gonna be coming after this.

625
00:40:28,507 --> 00:40:30,345
Cami is not ready for that, not yet.

626
00:40:30,511 --> 00:40:33,011
So what now?

627
00:40:33,012 --> 00:40:35,280
Storm clouds are gathering.

628
00:40:35,281 --> 00:40:38,917
Someone bombed those wolves,
and we know it wasn't us.

629
00:40:38,918 --> 00:40:44,621
Witches, humans, vampires, wolves.

630
00:40:47,027 --> 00:40:49,572
City is at a breaking point.

631
00:40:55,233 --> 00:40:57,580
We need to be ready.

632
00:40:59,470 --> 00:41:04,308
First Marcel's massacre,
now bombs in the bayou.

633
00:41:04,309 --> 00:41:09,300
I'll assume you're ready to
give up this doomed treaty.

634
00:41:09,466 --> 00:41:13,584
This alliance with the wolves,
well, if it is to succeed,

635
00:41:13,585 --> 00:41:16,319
I believe you'll want this.

636
00:41:18,823 --> 00:41:23,594
Seems I have Hayley to thank
for your change of heart.

637
00:41:23,595 --> 00:41:27,860
The rifts in this city run far deeper
than I even imagined, Niklaus.

638
00:41:30,101 --> 00:41:33,771
These tribes, these
factions, they're families,

639
00:41:33,772 --> 00:41:35,743
families who choose to fight.

640
00:41:38,175 --> 00:41:43,613
Mayhem has descended upon our home,
and if I'm to choose a side...

641
00:41:49,887 --> 00:41:51,893
To our victory, brother.

642
00:41:58,712 --> 00:42:03,364
