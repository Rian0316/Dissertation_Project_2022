1
00:00:47,267 --> 00:00:50,226
What time is the Minister
recording this broadcast?

2
00:00:50,387 --> 00:00:51,820
Two p. m., Sir Humphrey.

3
00:00:51,987 --> 00:00:54,979
Can't you stop him referring
to the Solihull project?

4
00:00:55,147 --> 00:00:57,058
- There's not a hope.
- Oh, God.

5
00:00:57,227 --> 00:00:59,866
"It's a shining example
of collaboration

6
00:01:00,027 --> 00:01:02,177
between government
and industry".

7
00:01:02,347 --> 00:01:05,305
- How could he think that?
- You told him itwas.

8
00:01:06,987 --> 00:01:08,739
Can a 74 million
building project

9
00:01:08,907 --> 00:01:11,979
in the middle of a city,
be swept underthe carpet?

10
00:01:12,307 --> 00:01:15,982
- We'll use the Official Secrets
- A secret? It's so huge.

11
00:01:16,147 --> 00:01:18,342
It's a big secret, Bernard.

12
00:01:18,507 --> 00:01:20,941
But you can't use
the Official Secrets Act

13
00:01:21,107 --> 00:01:23,177
with something
everybody knows about?

14
00:01:23,467 --> 00:01:28,336
The Official Secrets Act is not
to protect secrets, but officials.

15
00:01:29,907 --> 00:01:32,137
Why haven't you allowed me
to show

16
00:01:32,307 --> 00:01:35,982
the Solihull Report to the
Minister, tell him the truth?

17
00:01:36,427 --> 00:01:37,780
He hasn't asked.

18
00:01:37,947 --> 00:01:40,939
Why bothera Minister
ifhe doesn'twant to know?

19
00:01:41,107 --> 00:01:43,462
But how could he ask
ifhe doesn't know?

20
00:01:43,707 --> 00:01:45,060
Quite so.

21
00:01:45,227 --> 00:01:48,424
It's not that I'm questioning
yourjudgement but...

22
00:01:48,587 --> 00:01:50,305
- But?
- But why?

23
00:01:50,627 --> 00:01:53,699
Because, Bernard,
the Solihull Report contained

24
00:01:53,867 --> 00:01:57,303
a paragraph casting doubt
on the financial soundness

25
00:01:57,467 --> 00:02:00,664
of Michael Bradley
and Sloane Enterprises Ltd.

26
00:02:00,827 --> 00:02:04,581
And the report's foresight had some
insight in the light ofhindsight?

27
00:02:04,867 --> 00:02:05,936
What?

28
00:02:06,187 --> 00:02:08,906
If it said that Michael Bradley
was going to go bust?

29
00:02:09,067 --> 00:02:11,058
Please, Bernard,
watch your language.

30
00:02:11,627 --> 00:02:15,381
The point is that, by the time
the Report came out, I was so...

31
00:02:15,547 --> 00:02:18,778
orratherthe Department
was so committed to Bradley

32
00:02:18,947 --> 00:02:22,576
that it seemed worth taking
the risk to see the project through.

33
00:02:22,747 --> 00:02:25,739
If the Ministerknows
this partnerwas going bust,

34
00:02:25,907 --> 00:02:28,467
he wouldn't make
a broadcast about it.

35
00:02:28,667 --> 00:02:32,865
Ministers should neverknow
more than they need to know.

36
00:02:33,107 --> 00:02:34,586
Then they can't tell anyone.

37
00:02:36,187 --> 00:02:37,905
Like secret agents.

38
00:02:38,267 --> 00:02:39,859
They could be captured
and tortured.

39
00:02:40,027 --> 00:02:41,380
By terrorists?

40
00:02:41,547 --> 00:02:43,458
By the BBC, Bernard.

41
00:02:44,307 --> 00:02:47,902
The bank doesn't know
whetherornot to foreclose.

42
00:02:48,067 --> 00:02:51,343
I'll dine with Sir Desmond
Glazebrook, theirChairman.

43
00:02:51,547 --> 00:02:53,299
We might manage
to cook something up.

44
00:02:53,467 --> 00:02:55,139
Why don't you go
to a restaurant?

45
00:02:57,027 --> 00:02:59,336
Anyway, in the meantime,
come what may,

46
00:02:59,507 --> 00:03:03,341
the Ministermust not refer
to the Solihull Project on the air.

47
00:03:03,507 --> 00:03:06,943
Sir Humphrey,
this is a bit of a coverup, isn't it?

48
00:03:07,187 --> 00:03:08,256
Certainly not.

49
00:03:08,427 --> 00:03:12,022
It is responsible discretion
exercised in the national interest

50
00:03:12,187 --> 00:03:16,339
to prevent unnecessary disclosure
of eminently justifiable procedures

51
00:03:16,507 --> 00:03:20,705
in which untimely revelation could
severely impairpublic confidence.

52
00:03:20,867 --> 00:03:22,698
Oh, I see.
It's like Watergate?

53
00:03:22,867 --> 00:03:23,867
Bernard!

54
00:03:25,707 --> 00:03:29,177
If you wish to leave the Service
and become a BBC interviewer,

55
00:03:29,347 --> 00:03:32,066
- you have only to apply.
- I'm sorry, but...

56
00:03:32,227 --> 00:03:34,183
Howwas Watergate
different exactly?

57
00:03:34,347 --> 00:03:37,020
Watergate happened
in America, Bernard!

58
00:03:37,827 --> 00:03:39,624
Oh yes, yes. I see.

59
00:03:40,987 --> 00:03:43,137
- Good morning, Minister.
- Good morning.

60
00:03:43,307 --> 00:03:45,104
Morning, Bernard.
Sorry I'm late.

61
00:03:45,267 --> 00:03:47,144
Put them on the desk, George.

62
00:03:47,307 --> 00:03:50,583
I don'twant to be late
at Broadcasting House.

63
00:03:50,747 --> 00:03:53,864
What's the broadcast all about?
NATO, wasn't it?

64
00:03:54,027 --> 00:03:55,938
No, partherships in industry.

65
00:03:56,427 --> 00:03:59,260
Oh, yes. I knew
itwas something like that.

66
00:03:59,787 --> 00:04:01,937
- Who else is in it?
- It's all in there.

67
00:04:02,107 --> 00:04:04,302
An Employer
and a Trades Unionist.

68
00:04:04,747 --> 00:04:06,146
Joe Morgan?

69
00:04:06,307 --> 00:04:09,219
Wasn't he the TUC representative
on the Solihull project?

70
00:04:09,387 --> 00:04:10,536
Er, Minister...

71
00:04:11,587 --> 00:04:12,736
Yes, Humphrey?

72
00:04:12,907 --> 00:04:16,536
You are not proposing to refer
to the Solihull project on the air?

73
00:04:16,707 --> 00:04:19,175
Yes. It's a shining example
of cooperation

74
00:04:19,347 --> 00:04:21,303
between the Government
and industry.

75
00:04:21,467 --> 00:04:24,265
But I would be much happier
if itwere omitted.

76
00:04:24,427 --> 00:04:25,427
Why?

77
00:04:25,587 --> 00:04:28,147
Don't you think
it's ratherpremature?

78
00:04:28,307 --> 00:04:30,867
Certainly not.
Building started months ago.

79
00:04:31,267 --> 00:04:34,145
Exactly.
Ratherout of date, in fact.

80
00:04:34,307 --> 00:04:36,218
Premature and out of date?

81
00:04:36,387 --> 00:04:38,218
Well, untimely.

82
00:04:38,387 --> 00:04:41,140
Would it be uninteresting
to the general public?

83
00:04:41,307 --> 00:04:43,298
No. It's something
that's going on.

84
00:04:43,467 --> 00:04:45,503
- Extremely interesting.
- Yes. Quite so.

85
00:04:45,667 --> 00:04:47,658
So interesting
that there is a danger

86
00:04:47,827 --> 00:04:50,705
that it might obscure
yourmain point, perhaps.

87
00:04:50,987 --> 00:04:52,545
What is my main point?

88
00:04:54,107 --> 00:04:56,541
Bernard, what's the Minister's
main point?

89
00:04:56,747 --> 00:05:00,262
Private projects are more socially
responsible with government money,

90
00:05:00,427 --> 00:05:03,624
and government projects are more
efficientwith private investment.

91
00:05:03,787 --> 00:05:06,062
You see?
It underlines my main point.

92
00:05:06,227 --> 00:05:08,024
You really are a wet blanket.

93
00:05:08,187 --> 00:05:10,178
Just go about stirring up apathy.

94
00:05:10,427 --> 00:05:12,895
Minister, I must seriously
advise you

95
00:05:13,067 --> 00:05:15,422
with all the earnestness
at my command,

96
00:05:15,587 --> 00:05:18,579
not to referto the Solihull Project
on the air.

97
00:05:18,747 --> 00:05:19,816
Why?

98
00:05:20,267 --> 00:05:22,064
- What?
- I said, why?

99
00:05:22,467 --> 00:05:23,536
- Why?
- Why?

100
00:05:24,147 --> 00:05:25,147
Well, Minister...

101
00:05:25,307 --> 00:05:28,299
Are you planning to take
the credit forthis yourself?

102
00:05:28,627 --> 00:05:31,778
At the European Convention
of Government administration.

103
00:05:31,947 --> 00:05:34,825
Yourspeech will make
very good reading.

104
00:05:34,987 --> 00:05:36,864
Well, a fewfacts of life.

105
00:05:37,427 --> 00:05:40,897
Politicians are responsible
ultimately to the people,

106
00:05:41,067 --> 00:05:44,184
and we get the credit.
Not Civil Servants.

107
00:05:44,347 --> 00:05:48,386
I would be happyforyou to have
the "credit" forthis project.

108
00:05:48,547 --> 00:05:51,619
But, I must beg, beseech
and implore you not today.

109
00:05:51,787 --> 00:05:54,904
No, it's no good.
I'm not going to fall for it.

110
00:05:55,067 --> 00:05:57,865
I'm going to get
all the political capital of this.

111
00:05:58,027 --> 00:05:59,983
I know a good thing
when I see one.

112
00:06:00,147 --> 00:06:02,103
- Please, do listen to...
- No. No. No.

113
00:06:02,267 --> 00:06:03,666
- Minister, p...
- No,

114
00:06:04,427 --> 00:06:05,701
Humpy.

115
00:06:10,587 --> 00:06:11,940
- What?
- What?

116
00:06:15,947 --> 00:06:19,144
If it had been up to me,
I'd help out like a shot.

117
00:06:19,587 --> 00:06:20,622
Quite so.

118
00:06:20,787 --> 00:06:23,255
It's not the bank's fault
if some idiot Minister

119
00:06:23,427 --> 00:06:26,260
gets into bed with a kid,
who runs with the money.

120
00:06:26,427 --> 00:06:28,895
That Ministerwasn't
entirely to blame.

121
00:06:29,067 --> 00:06:31,376
There were extenuating
circumstances.

122
00:06:31,547 --> 00:06:34,857
This Bradley chap looked
very sound at the time.

123
00:06:35,027 --> 00:06:38,542
But you wouldn't have done
a damn fool thing like that.

124
00:06:39,267 --> 00:06:40,495
Would you?

125
00:06:40,747 --> 00:06:44,217
When it looked like Bradley
wanted a loan thatwas one thing.

126
00:06:44,387 --> 00:06:46,184
But nowhe can't pay his bills.

127
00:06:46,347 --> 00:06:47,700
Well, he is unlikely

128
00:06:47,867 --> 00:06:51,382
to fulfil his financial undertakings
to Her Majesty's Government.

129
00:06:51,547 --> 00:06:53,265
Can't pay his bills, you mean.

130
00:06:53,747 --> 00:06:57,979
And Her Majesty's Government's
undertakings go down with him.

131
00:06:58,147 --> 00:06:59,147
Yes.

132
00:06:59,307 --> 00:07:02,982
Unless a reputable bank were
to take overthe contract

133
00:07:03,147 --> 00:07:06,901
from Bradley with a view
to participating in a project

134
00:07:07,067 --> 00:07:10,855
which Her Majesty's Government
is determined to make profitable.

135
00:07:11,027 --> 00:07:12,027
Quite so.

136
00:07:12,187 --> 00:07:14,655
More Sancerre
for Her Majesty's Government?

137
00:07:16,227 --> 00:07:18,787
Well, like I say,
it's up to my Board.

138
00:07:18,947 --> 00:07:20,983
Could go eitherway,
quite frankly.

139
00:07:21,387 --> 00:07:23,218
- Could go eitherway.
- I see.

140
00:07:24,507 --> 00:07:27,817
Incidentally, to change
the subject completely,

141
00:07:27,987 --> 00:07:30,740
you rememberthe new
Ministry Copartnership

142
00:07:30,907 --> 00:07:32,863
Commission you mentioned?

143
00:07:33,027 --> 00:07:34,142
Indeed.

144
00:07:34,307 --> 00:07:36,946
The Chairmanship
hasn't been filled yet?

145
00:07:38,347 --> 00:07:41,464
- Not yet, Desmond.
- Because if itwere to be...

146
00:07:41,627 --> 00:07:43,345
should one be offered...

147
00:07:43,547 --> 00:07:46,266
not forthe money,
I mean, what's 8,000 a year?

148
00:07:46,547 --> 00:07:49,061
160 a week. Part time.

149
00:07:49,227 --> 00:07:50,376
Quite.

150
00:07:50,867 --> 00:07:53,540
But itwould be a fascinating...

151
00:07:53,707 --> 00:07:56,380
Has anything been decided,
informally?

152
00:07:56,707 --> 00:07:59,346
You're looking around
fora couple of quangos,

153
00:07:59,507 --> 00:08:00,940
and I can tell you,

154
00:08:02,547 --> 00:08:05,744
in complete confidence,
that yourname is

155
00:08:07,907 --> 00:08:09,420
on the shortlist.

156
00:08:10,907 --> 00:08:12,135
On the shortlist?

157
00:08:12,867 --> 00:08:16,018
Quangos can't suddenly
be in short supply, can they?

158
00:08:16,347 --> 00:08:18,736
There's report
in today's Telegraph.

159
00:08:18,907 --> 00:08:20,386
"The Quango Jungle:

160
00:08:21,787 --> 00:08:24,779
There are still around 8,000
paid appointments

161
00:08:24,947 --> 00:08:28,576
within the gift of Ministers
to Quasi Autonomous NGOs,

162
00:08:28,747 --> 00:08:31,898
- at five million pounds a year".
- You'll have two orthree spare.

163
00:08:32,067 --> 00:08:34,183
There's certainly
a lot of them around,

164
00:08:34,347 --> 00:08:36,907
the point is finding
one that is appropriate.

165
00:08:37,187 --> 00:08:39,655
There has to be some reason
to appoint you.

166
00:08:40,827 --> 00:08:45,378
What about the Advisory Committee
of Dental Establishments?

167
00:08:45,707 --> 00:08:48,585
- Know anything about teeth?
- I'm a banker.

168
00:08:49,907 --> 00:08:52,660
And that rules out
the Milk Marketing Board, too.

169
00:08:52,867 --> 00:08:53,867
Right.

170
00:08:54,747 --> 00:08:57,978
How about the Dumping
at Sea Representations Panel?

171
00:08:58,147 --> 00:09:00,741
- Do you live nearthe sea?
- Knightsbridge.

172
00:09:03,987 --> 00:09:05,420
Just behind Harrods.

173
00:09:07,107 --> 00:09:08,665
Not nearenough.

174
00:09:08,907 --> 00:09:12,786
That more or less rules out the
Clyde River Purification Board too.

175
00:09:13,107 --> 00:09:14,938
- Rump steak?
- That's forme.

176
00:09:15,107 --> 00:09:17,382
Meat Marketing Board.
Know anything about meat?

177
00:09:17,747 --> 00:09:19,021
I eat it.

178
00:09:19,707 --> 00:09:21,026
Not enough.

179
00:09:21,427 --> 00:09:23,497
It rules out the Meat
and Liverstock Commission.

180
00:09:23,667 --> 00:09:26,056
- Doversole. Sir?
- White Fish Authority?

181
00:09:26,227 --> 00:09:27,227
Potatoes?

182
00:09:27,387 --> 00:09:29,298
Potato Marketing Board?

183
00:09:30,227 --> 00:09:33,902
The Governors of the National
Vegetable Research Station?

184
00:09:34,307 --> 00:09:37,265
The National Biological
Standards Board?

185
00:09:37,427 --> 00:09:39,782
Is that my salad.
Thank you, Robert.

186
00:09:40,987 --> 00:09:44,423
The Arable Crops
and Forage Board?

187
00:09:45,307 --> 00:09:48,265
The Food and Drink
Training Board?

188
00:09:48,507 --> 00:09:50,463
Some French mustard, please?

189
00:09:50,627 --> 00:09:54,700
What about the Food Additives
and Contaminants committee?

190
00:09:55,867 --> 00:09:58,427
I know very little
about any of those.

191
00:09:58,867 --> 00:10:01,779
- Well, what do you know about?
- Nothing.

192
00:10:02,667 --> 00:10:05,056
Nothing really.
I'm a banker.

193
00:10:08,187 --> 00:10:09,620
This is not easy.

194
00:10:13,587 --> 00:10:16,340
The Fire Services
Examinations Board?

195
00:10:20,187 --> 00:10:21,905
St. John's Ambulance?

196
00:10:23,467 --> 00:10:25,537
- French mustard, sir.
- Thank you.

197
00:10:25,747 --> 00:10:28,625
What about the Plant Varieties
and Seeds Tribunal?

198
00:10:29,147 --> 00:10:31,263
Dammit, Humphrey, I'm a banker.

199
00:10:31,587 --> 00:10:32,781
Thank you.

200
00:10:33,907 --> 00:10:36,899
There must be some minority
group that you can represent.

201
00:10:37,827 --> 00:10:38,976
Bankers.

202
00:10:39,867 --> 00:10:43,143
You see, the ideal quango
appointee is a black, Welsh,

203
00:10:43,307 --> 00:10:45,616
disabled woman Trade Unionist.

204
00:10:47,307 --> 00:10:50,026
We're all looking
around forone of them.

205
00:10:50,427 --> 00:10:53,305
- You don't happen to know any?
- No.

206
00:10:53,467 --> 00:10:54,980
No. Well...

207
00:10:55,147 --> 00:10:59,379
It all boils down to the Industry
Copartnership Commission.

208
00:10:59,547 --> 00:11:01,458
I'd find that quite acceptable.

209
00:11:01,627 --> 00:11:04,460
Well, it is within the gift
of my Minister.

210
00:11:05,027 --> 00:11:07,780
And you need only put
in appearances twice a month.

211
00:11:07,947 --> 00:11:09,175
Lots of papers?

212
00:11:09,347 --> 00:11:12,419
Yes, but itwouldn't be awfully
necessary to read them.

213
00:11:13,467 --> 00:11:15,583
I wouldn't have anything to say
at the meetings.

214
00:11:15,747 --> 00:11:18,898
Splendid. You're just the chap
I'm looking for.

215
00:11:24,387 --> 00:11:26,423
Broadcasting House, please.

216
00:11:37,187 --> 00:11:39,257
Sorry to keep you, George.

217
00:11:39,427 --> 00:11:42,578
When you drop me, please
take Mr. Wooly on to the House.

218
00:11:43,027 --> 00:11:45,621
Why Humphrey wants to stop me

219
00:11:45,787 --> 00:11:48,347
mentioning
the Solihull Project on the air?

220
00:11:48,507 --> 00:11:51,419
Didn't you think he gave
6 or 7 convincing reasons?

221
00:11:51,587 --> 00:11:52,986
No. Did you?

222
00:11:53,147 --> 00:11:55,024
I think he knows
what he's doing.

223
00:11:55,187 --> 00:11:56,666
Sure he does.

224
00:11:56,867 --> 00:11:58,698
I only wish I knew
what he was doing.

225
00:11:58,867 --> 00:12:01,939
I'm sure if Sir Humphrey
advises something, then,

226
00:12:02,107 --> 00:12:04,905
whateverhe does advise
is advisable.

227
00:12:06,707 --> 00:12:09,221
- What do you advise?
- It's not forme to advise,

228
00:12:09,387 --> 00:12:11,947
but I would advise you
that you would be

229
00:12:12,107 --> 00:12:15,224
well advised to follow
Sir Humphrey's advice.

230
00:12:16,387 --> 00:12:17,387
Why?

231
00:12:17,667 --> 00:12:19,737
Well, it's just that...

232
00:12:19,907 --> 00:12:22,057
certain projects have
certain aspects which,

233
00:12:22,227 --> 00:12:25,822
with sensitive handling,
given reasonable discretion,

234
00:12:25,987 --> 00:12:30,299
when events permit,
there is no prima facie reason why,

235
00:12:30,547 --> 00:12:34,256
with appropriate give and take,
if if all goes well,

236
00:12:34,427 --> 00:12:38,784
in the fullness of time,
when the moment is ripe, er...

237
00:12:40,187 --> 00:12:41,745
You're blathering.

238
00:12:42,427 --> 00:12:45,146
- Yes, Minister.
- Why are you blathering?

239
00:12:45,307 --> 00:12:46,865
It's my job, Minister.

240
00:12:48,107 --> 00:12:51,258
An example of this
is going on up in Solihull now.

241
00:12:51,467 --> 00:12:53,423
Government money
and private investment

242
00:12:53,587 --> 00:12:55,543
working together
in a real partnership.

243
00:12:55,707 --> 00:12:56,935
Claptrap.

244
00:12:57,107 --> 00:13:00,702
And it's symbolic of the way
this Government is working.

245
00:13:00,867 --> 00:13:04,462
I've taken a personal interest
in the Solihull Project because...

246
00:13:04,627 --> 00:13:08,586
Not justwords, it is actually there
in bricks and mortar.

247
00:13:08,947 --> 00:13:11,666
A concrete example,
if I may put it like that,

248
00:13:11,827 --> 00:13:14,466
of the fact that ourprinciples
really work.

249
00:13:14,747 --> 00:13:18,103
Thank you, Minister.
One lastword, Mr. Conway?

250
00:13:18,467 --> 00:13:22,380
There's nothing wrong
with the principle of partnership...

251
00:13:22,547 --> 00:13:24,936
Provided
that there's no interference

252
00:13:25,107 --> 00:13:28,656
in management decisions
from the State orthe workforce.

253
00:13:28,827 --> 00:13:30,977
Thank you, Mr. Conway.
Joe Morgan?

254
00:13:31,187 --> 00:13:33,906
Dear, oh dear, oh dear.

255
00:13:34,587 --> 00:13:37,181
We all know
that Mr. Conway is talking

256
00:13:37,347 --> 00:13:39,622
out of date capitalist claptrap.

257
00:13:40,547 --> 00:13:42,981
If partnership is to mean
anything, it must mean

258
00:13:43,147 --> 00:13:46,935
an equal partnership between
unions, government and industry.

259
00:13:47,107 --> 00:13:49,302
- In that order.
- Afinal word, Minister?

260
00:13:49,467 --> 00:13:53,096
- There's no need to be offensive.
- Gentlemen, please.

261
00:13:53,347 --> 00:13:55,065
We're all in agreement.

262
00:13:55,227 --> 00:13:58,378
We've shown
that if we can work together

263
00:13:58,547 --> 00:14:00,663
we can forge a new Britain.

264
00:14:00,827 --> 00:14:04,536
And it's a pleasure to talk
to two of the principal forgers...

265
00:14:04,707 --> 00:14:06,504
principal participants.

266
00:14:06,747 --> 00:14:07,747
Thank you.

267
00:14:07,907 --> 00:14:11,058
James Hacker, Minister
forAdministrative Affairs,

268
00:14:11,227 --> 00:14:15,459
was talking with George Conway,
from the Construction Federation,

269
00:14:15,627 --> 00:14:19,984
and Joe Morgan, from the Commercial
and Administrative Workers Union.

270
00:14:23,347 --> 00:14:26,384
Splendid. Thank you all.
Jean will take you to Hospitality.

271
00:14:26,547 --> 00:14:28,981
- Was it really all right?
- First class.

272
00:14:29,147 --> 00:14:30,819
Most interesting, Minister.

273
00:14:32,107 --> 00:14:36,180
Can we edit that awful Hacker
waffle down to two and a half?

274
00:14:36,507 --> 00:14:38,099
Leave the Solihull bit.

275
00:14:39,467 --> 00:14:42,300
- Joe, see you later.
- Yes, George.

276
00:14:42,467 --> 00:14:44,662
I hope you won't mind
my mentioning it,

277
00:14:44,827 --> 00:14:46,897
Mr. Harker, but could
you put a word in

278
00:14:47,067 --> 00:14:50,025
formy members' claim for
a special Birmingham allowance?

279
00:14:50,187 --> 00:14:54,066
I don't think I can conduct Trade
Union negotiations in a BBC studio.

280
00:14:54,347 --> 00:14:57,180
And that's a matter
forthe Employment...

281
00:14:57,347 --> 00:14:59,542
- But a word from you...
- No, I'm sorry.

282
00:14:59,707 --> 00:15:03,382
We'd have a Manchesterallowance,
Plymouth allowance,

283
00:15:03,547 --> 00:15:05,299
Chipping Sodbury allowance...

284
00:15:05,467 --> 00:15:09,904
Afterthis broadcast people might
ask about the Solihull project,

285
00:15:10,067 --> 00:15:12,058
wanting to knowmore about it.

286
00:15:12,227 --> 00:15:13,376
I hope they do.

287
00:15:13,547 --> 00:15:18,177
But as we know, there are
some things betternot found out.

288
00:15:19,907 --> 00:15:21,977
I'm sure we understand
one another.

289
00:15:23,627 --> 00:15:24,696
Do we?

290
00:15:25,547 --> 00:15:27,185
Something in youreye?

291
00:15:28,107 --> 00:15:30,382
- Just a gleam.
- What?

292
00:15:30,667 --> 00:15:32,464
Oh, come off it, Hacker.

293
00:15:32,627 --> 00:15:35,300
We've got you
by the short and curlies.

294
00:15:36,107 --> 00:15:38,621
And I'm asking
10 % below London allowance,

295
00:15:38,787 --> 00:15:41,506
and we'll settle for 30 % below.

296
00:15:41,667 --> 00:15:43,817
Give you the credit
forbeating us down.

297
00:15:43,987 --> 00:15:47,297
No allowance. You'd better
resign youself to that.

298
00:15:47,667 --> 00:15:50,739
I'm not the one
who will have to resign.

299
00:15:51,107 --> 00:15:53,860
- What are you talking about?
- The Solihull Project.

300
00:15:54,027 --> 00:15:57,019
I could hardly believe
you took all the credit for it.

301
00:15:57,187 --> 00:16:00,657
Great courage, of course,
but whateverpossessed you?

302
00:16:00,827 --> 00:16:04,024
"Cannons to the right ofhim,
Cannons to the left ofhim,

303
00:16:04,187 --> 00:16:06,906
Into the Valley of death
rode Mr. Hacker".

304
00:16:14,427 --> 00:16:15,860
How did it go, sir?

305
00:16:16,947 --> 00:16:19,222
Oh, very well. Very well.

306
00:16:19,747 --> 00:16:22,819
I was talking about government
industry cooperation.

307
00:16:23,547 --> 00:16:26,539
There's a very interesting project
in the Midlands.

308
00:16:26,707 --> 00:16:30,905
I don't suppose you'd have heard
about it, but it's very interesting

309
00:16:31,827 --> 00:16:33,704
if you know the background.

310
00:16:33,907 --> 00:16:36,216
You don't mean
the Solihull Project, sir?

311
00:16:36,507 --> 00:16:38,463
Yes. You have heard about it.

312
00:16:41,187 --> 00:16:43,576
- What are you laughing about?
- Nothing, sir.

313
00:16:47,027 --> 00:16:49,416
- What have you heard?
- Nothing really, sir.

314
00:16:50,267 --> 00:16:52,223
It's a shining example
of collaboration

315
00:16:52,387 --> 00:16:54,343
between government
and industry.

316
00:16:56,667 --> 00:16:58,862
What do you know about all this?

317
00:16:59,027 --> 00:17:03,339
37 journeys between the Ministry
and Mr. Michael Bradley's office,

318
00:17:03,507 --> 00:17:06,897
44 Farringdon Street, and
129 Birmingham Road, Solihull.

319
00:17:07,307 --> 00:17:08,865
37 journeys? Who with?

320
00:17:09,027 --> 00:17:12,303
Yourpredecessor, sir,
and Sir Humphrey, mostly.

321
00:17:14,987 --> 00:17:17,626
Very cheerful they were,
on the first few trips.

322
00:17:17,787 --> 00:17:20,620
They kept talking about
shining examples

323
00:17:20,787 --> 00:17:23,426
of successful collaboration
and such like.

324
00:17:23,947 --> 00:17:26,541
Then the gloom started
to come down.

325
00:17:27,347 --> 00:17:30,225
- Gloom?
- Well, no not gloom.

326
00:17:30,747 --> 00:17:32,863
More like desperation, really.

327
00:17:33,227 --> 00:17:35,138
Desperation?
What about?

328
00:17:36,027 --> 00:17:38,222
You know the background, sir.

329
00:17:39,067 --> 00:17:40,739
Well, yes, yes...

330
00:17:41,747 --> 00:17:44,705
Any bit of the background
you were thinking of?

331
00:17:45,027 --> 00:17:48,906
No. When something's fishy,
it's just fishy, isn't it?

332
00:17:49,267 --> 00:17:51,986
You don't knowwhich bit
the smell's coming from.

333
00:17:52,347 --> 00:17:55,419
- Fishy?
- Well, I don't really know.

334
00:17:55,827 --> 00:17:58,899
Forall I know,
Mr. Bradley may be quite kosher,

335
00:17:59,067 --> 00:18:02,184
despite everything
Sir Humphrey said about him.

336
00:18:02,627 --> 00:18:05,016
You knowmore about all that
than I do.

337
00:18:05,187 --> 00:18:06,461
I'm just the driver.

338
00:18:07,267 --> 00:18:08,700
Quite. Quite.

339
00:18:09,267 --> 00:18:11,098
I'm just the Minister.

340
00:18:11,907 --> 00:18:15,422
An allowance for Morgan's union
is out of the question.

341
00:18:15,587 --> 00:18:17,703
But howwas the broadcast?

342
00:18:17,987 --> 00:18:20,023
Well, all right, I think.

343
00:18:20,187 --> 00:18:21,461
You think?

344
00:18:21,907 --> 00:18:24,740
I talked
about the Solihull Project.

345
00:18:24,987 --> 00:18:27,421
And then I had second thoughts.

346
00:18:27,587 --> 00:18:29,305
Any particularreason?

347
00:18:29,707 --> 00:18:34,383
No... Humphrey, is everything all
right about the Solihull Project?

348
00:18:34,707 --> 00:18:35,856
Yes, Minister.

349
00:18:36,027 --> 00:18:38,382
The building works
proceed satisfactorily.

350
00:18:38,547 --> 00:18:41,061
No, no, no,
that's not what I meant.

351
00:18:41,707 --> 00:18:44,585
- Is something going on?
- Building is going on.

352
00:18:44,747 --> 00:18:46,021
No, no, Humphrey.

353
00:18:46,187 --> 00:18:48,064
Something's up, isn't it?

354
00:18:48,387 --> 00:18:50,378
- Yes indeed, Minister.
- What?

355
00:18:50,547 --> 00:18:52,981
The 1st floor is up,
and the 2nd flooralmost up.

356
00:18:53,147 --> 00:18:56,139
I'm talking about the whole basis
of the thing.

357
00:18:56,307 --> 00:18:57,899
Oh, I see.

358
00:18:58,067 --> 00:19:01,503
- What can you tell me about?
- As I understand it...

359
00:19:01,667 --> 00:19:04,101
The basis is an aggregate
of gravel and cement on

360
00:19:04,267 --> 00:19:06,258
six feet ofbest builders rubble.

361
00:19:06,427 --> 00:19:09,180
You know I am talking
about the finance.

362
00:19:09,347 --> 00:19:13,135
Ourcontractwith the construction
company you mean?

363
00:19:13,307 --> 00:19:16,265
The stage payments are
in accordance with all the usual...

364
00:19:16,427 --> 00:19:18,782
Humphrey!
What is it that I don't know?

365
00:19:19,667 --> 00:19:23,501
- What precisely do you mean?
- I don't know.

366
00:19:24,107 --> 00:19:26,223
That's just it, I don't know

367
00:19:26,387 --> 00:19:29,538
because I can't find
what questions to ask you,

368
00:19:29,707 --> 00:19:32,665
and I don't knowwhat to ask you
because I don't know.

369
00:19:32,827 --> 00:19:34,545
What is it that I don't know?

370
00:19:34,787 --> 00:19:37,779
Minister, I don't know
what you don't know.

371
00:19:38,267 --> 00:19:40,019
It could be almost anything.

372
00:19:40,187 --> 00:19:43,179
- Your're keeping something from me.
- Yes indeed.

373
00:19:43,387 --> 00:19:46,584
It is the Department's duty
to protect the Minister

374
00:19:46,747 --> 00:19:49,466
from the great tide
of irrelevant information

375
00:19:49,627 --> 00:19:52,858
that beats against the walls
of this Department.

376
00:19:53,027 --> 00:19:55,063
There is something
about the Solihull Project

377
00:19:55,227 --> 00:19:57,502
that I know I don't know
and I know you know.

378
00:19:57,667 --> 00:19:59,737
I know Bernard knows.
Joe Morgan knows.

379
00:19:59,907 --> 00:20:01,818
My own driverknows
more than I do.

380
00:20:01,987 --> 00:20:05,423
Only poorJoe Soap who has
to tell the public about it

381
00:20:05,587 --> 00:20:08,704
hasn't got a clue
as to what's going on.

382
00:20:10,027 --> 00:20:12,257
Will you answer
a simple question?

383
00:20:12,467 --> 00:20:14,856
Certainly, Minister.
What is it?

384
00:20:15,587 --> 00:20:17,225
I don't know!

385
00:20:18,027 --> 00:20:20,097
If you tell me, I'll ask it!

386
00:20:20,507 --> 00:20:21,507
Well...

387
00:20:21,667 --> 00:20:24,056
- Yes, Frank?
- Ourmeeting.

388
00:20:24,227 --> 00:20:26,616
- About my quango paper.
- Come on in.

389
00:20:26,787 --> 00:20:30,063
- You've read Frank's paper?
- Yes indeed, Minister.

390
00:20:30,627 --> 00:20:34,256
What did you think about ending
the ministerial patronage?

391
00:20:34,427 --> 00:20:36,577
All those thousands
of jobs forthe boys.

392
00:20:36,747 --> 00:20:39,181
Most original and imaginative.

393
00:20:39,627 --> 00:20:40,696
You liked it?

394
00:20:40,867 --> 00:20:44,223
Those are two of Humphrey's
most damning criticisms.

395
00:20:44,507 --> 00:20:46,896
Itwould be a very popular
political move.

396
00:20:47,067 --> 00:20:50,343
Hand the quango appointments
overto Parliament.

397
00:20:50,507 --> 00:20:54,466
The best men forthe job instead
of old chums, partyhacks.

398
00:20:54,627 --> 00:20:56,458
It should be legislated.

399
00:20:56,627 --> 00:20:59,425
- It is a novel proposal...
- That's the otherkiller.

400
00:20:59,587 --> 00:21:02,181
But when a system
is working smoothly...

401
00:21:02,347 --> 00:21:05,544
Smoothly! Look at this!
Proposal forChairman

402
00:21:05,707 --> 00:21:08,779
of the new Industrial
Coparthership Commission,

403
00:21:08,947 --> 00:21:11,336
Sir Desmond Glazebrook,
I ask you!

404
00:21:11,507 --> 00:21:13,418
He's neverbeen in industry,

405
00:21:13,587 --> 00:21:16,784
and he's said unpleasant things
about this government.

406
00:21:16,947 --> 00:21:19,177
Is that a smoothly
operating system?

407
00:21:19,347 --> 00:21:22,100
- He would be an excellent...
- He's a blithering idiot!

408
00:21:22,267 --> 00:21:25,896
- Yes, but an excellent Chairman.
- I'm sorry, Humphrey.

409
00:21:26,067 --> 00:21:28,979
I am not going to appoint
Sir Desmond Glazebrook.

410
00:21:29,147 --> 00:21:31,536
- Minister, you must.
- No, no, no...

411
00:21:31,707 --> 00:21:34,540
- Please, Minister...
- No way. No Glazebrook.

412
00:21:34,707 --> 00:21:36,663
Overmy dead body. Right?

413
00:21:36,907 --> 00:21:40,297
Minister, before you make
yourfinal decision

414
00:21:42,147 --> 00:21:44,980
I think perhaps you ought
to see this.

415
00:21:47,307 --> 00:21:49,298
"Report on the Solihull Project".

416
00:21:49,467 --> 00:21:51,025
Why is it top secret?

417
00:21:52,227 --> 00:21:53,865
"7.5 million pounds...

418
00:21:54,027 --> 00:21:56,063
probably bankrupt proceedings...

419
00:21:57,187 --> 00:21:59,542
inminent collapse of project"...
well...

420
00:22:01,267 --> 00:22:03,542
Imminent collapse of project!

421
00:22:04,587 --> 00:22:06,145
Why didn't you tell me?

422
00:22:06,307 --> 00:22:09,265
I am conscious of the heavy
burdens of youroffice.

423
00:22:09,427 --> 00:22:12,100
But this'll be
all overthe front pages.

424
00:22:12,267 --> 00:22:14,542
It's a public scandal,
a disaster. It's...

425
00:22:14,707 --> 00:22:16,379
- It's appalling...
- Jim.

426
00:22:16,547 --> 00:22:19,778
It is dated before the election.
You're in the clear.

427
00:22:19,947 --> 00:22:22,939
Yes, but unfortunately
underthe convention

428
00:22:23,107 --> 00:22:25,940
of Ministerial responsability,
the blame must fall...

429
00:22:26,107 --> 00:22:28,575
- Everyone will know itwasn't Jim.
- Quite so.

430
00:22:28,747 --> 00:22:32,262
The principle of democratic
accountability requires

431
00:22:32,427 --> 00:22:34,463
the occasional human sacrifice.

432
00:22:35,067 --> 00:22:37,740
When the pack
is baying forblood...

433
00:22:37,907 --> 00:22:40,262
- Isn't that right?
- He'll point to the dates...

434
00:22:40,427 --> 00:22:44,306
Oh, a lesserman might try
to wriggle out of it.

435
00:22:44,467 --> 00:22:47,459
But there is only
one honourable course open.

436
00:22:47,667 --> 00:22:50,386
As the Minister is well aware.

437
00:22:50,987 --> 00:22:52,898
Frank might have a point?

438
00:22:53,107 --> 00:22:55,905
Only today you have publicly
identified yourself

439
00:22:56,067 --> 00:22:57,944
with the success of the project.

440
00:22:58,307 --> 00:23:00,377
The broadcast!
When's it going out?

441
00:23:00,547 --> 00:23:02,856
It's due fortransmission
about now.

442
00:23:03,027 --> 00:23:04,540
Get on to the BBC at once.

443
00:23:04,707 --> 00:23:06,698
- Stop it!
- Stop what? Oh yes...

444
00:23:07,427 --> 00:23:10,499
I wish you luck but you know
what the BBC are like.

445
00:23:10,667 --> 00:23:13,101
This is a crisis,
this is a scandal...

446
00:23:13,267 --> 00:23:16,816
If you were to put it like that,
they might...

447
00:23:16,987 --> 00:23:19,979
- Might what?
- Move it to peak listening time.

448
00:23:21,747 --> 00:23:22,862
Any luck?

449
00:23:23,027 --> 00:23:27,145
Aperfect example of what can be
done is going on up in Solihull.

450
00:23:27,307 --> 00:23:30,504
Government money and private
investment in real partnership

451
00:23:30,667 --> 00:23:34,706
to me, symbolic of everything
this Government is working for.

452
00:23:34,867 --> 00:23:38,382
I've taken a great personal
interest in the Solihull project.

453
00:23:38,547 --> 00:23:42,460
It's not just words, it's actually
there in bricks and mortar...

454
00:23:48,347 --> 00:23:51,419
"Symbolic of everything
this Government is working for".

455
00:23:52,347 --> 00:23:54,781
How could you let me say
all those things?

456
00:23:54,947 --> 00:23:56,903
Minister, I can only advise.

457
00:23:57,067 --> 00:23:59,535
I did advise.
I advised most strongly.

458
00:23:59,707 --> 00:24:01,823
But when the adviser's advice
is unheeded...

459
00:24:01,987 --> 00:24:03,705
All right, all right.

460
00:24:04,507 --> 00:24:06,304
Advise me now.

461
00:24:07,187 --> 00:24:08,700
Certainly, Minister.

462
00:24:08,987 --> 00:24:11,501
It is possible that the bank
may take over

463
00:24:11,667 --> 00:24:14,101
the contract from Bradley
and Sloane Enterprises Ltd.

464
00:24:14,267 --> 00:24:15,746
And all will be well.

465
00:24:15,907 --> 00:24:19,695
- The bank! Fine! Well...
- The bank, however, is hesitant.

466
00:24:19,987 --> 00:24:22,820
But it so happens that
the Director in charge

467
00:24:22,987 --> 00:24:25,376
is to retire next year
and he's anxious

468
00:24:25,547 --> 00:24:27,424
to find anotherappointment...

469
00:24:27,587 --> 00:24:29,976
a chairmanship of a quango,
for instance.

470
00:24:30,147 --> 00:24:31,341
Give him one!

471
00:24:31,547 --> 00:24:34,107
Give him that one you were
reserving forthat idiot

472
00:24:34,267 --> 00:24:36,223
Sir Desmond Glazebrook.

473
00:24:37,107 --> 00:24:38,301
Who is the Director?

474
00:24:38,467 --> 00:24:39,616
Desmond Glazebrook.

475
00:24:44,027 --> 00:24:45,904
He's not a bad chap, really.

476
00:24:46,707 --> 00:24:48,823
He's always attacking
the government.

477
00:24:48,987 --> 00:24:53,060
It does us good sometimes
to appoint ouropponents.

478
00:24:53,227 --> 00:24:55,218
It's democratic, statesmanlike.

479
00:24:55,387 --> 00:24:57,901
Yes, that's
a very good appointment.

480
00:24:58,067 --> 00:25:00,183
- But you can't.
- Do shut up, Frank!

481
00:25:00,627 --> 00:25:02,265
Anybody else know about this?

482
00:25:02,427 --> 00:25:05,976
Apart from ourselves
and the bank and Michael Bradley,

483
00:25:06,147 --> 00:25:08,103
the Union representative.

484
00:25:08,267 --> 00:25:09,825
Joe Morgan!
Of course.

485
00:25:10,107 --> 00:25:13,816
That's whatwas behind his special
Birmingham allowance claim.

486
00:25:14,147 --> 00:25:16,263
- Blackmail.
- Quite so, Minister.

487
00:25:16,427 --> 00:25:18,418
Humphrey, I've been thinking.

488
00:25:18,667 --> 00:25:21,784
Desmond Glazebrook
will need some support.

489
00:25:21,987 --> 00:25:23,340
A Deputy Chairman,

490
00:25:23,507 --> 00:25:26,226
someone with real
experience of Industry.

491
00:25:27,307 --> 00:25:29,263
An excellent thought.

492
00:25:29,547 --> 00:25:33,745
Is there anyone you could
advise me would be appropriate?

493
00:25:34,067 --> 00:25:36,740
ATrade Unionist, forexample?

494
00:25:39,147 --> 00:25:41,502
What about Joe Morgan,
Minister?

495
00:25:41,667 --> 00:25:43,066
Joe Morgan!

496
00:25:43,987 --> 00:25:46,421
What an excellent idea.
Well done.

497
00:25:46,587 --> 00:25:48,862
It takes two to quango, Minister.

498
00:25:50,547 --> 00:25:52,856
Get on to them both immediately.

499
00:25:53,027 --> 00:25:55,905
This is what's wrong
with the system!

500
00:25:56,067 --> 00:25:59,184
It's jobs forthe boys,
quid pro quo corruption.

501
00:25:59,347 --> 00:26:01,338
What about my quango
abolition paper?

502
00:26:01,507 --> 00:26:04,738
Very good, Frank.
Original and imaginative.

503
00:26:04,907 --> 00:26:06,135
- Novel.
- Novel.

504
00:26:07,147 --> 00:26:09,422
I'm serious about it.
What are you going to do?

505
00:26:12,827 --> 00:26:15,546
You're not going to suppress it.

506
00:26:15,707 --> 00:26:18,585
I'll get it adopted as party policy.

507
00:26:18,747 --> 00:26:21,022
If the Press were
to get hold of this...

508
00:26:21,187 --> 00:26:24,065
Yes, if the Press
were to get hold of this.

509
00:26:24,227 --> 00:26:26,821
- What a story!
- Frank, I've been wondering.

510
00:26:26,987 --> 00:26:29,660
Have you everthought
of serving on a quango?

511
00:26:29,827 --> 00:26:31,624
You're not corrupting me.

512
00:26:31,787 --> 00:26:33,539
No, no, of course not.

513
00:26:33,707 --> 00:26:35,857
But perhaps
betterthan abolishing

514
00:26:36,027 --> 00:26:38,985
the entire system
would be to make itwork.

515
00:26:39,467 --> 00:26:42,106
Humphrey and I were thinking,
if we were to set up

516
00:26:42,267 --> 00:26:44,781
a special commission
to investigate and report

517
00:26:44,947 --> 00:26:48,064
on the composition
and activities of all quangos,

518
00:26:48,227 --> 00:26:49,979
that might be the answer.

519
00:26:50,147 --> 00:26:51,182
The answer!

520
00:26:51,347 --> 00:26:54,783
Itwould have to be very senior,
mostly Privy Councillors.

521
00:26:55,787 --> 00:26:58,426
But itwould need too
some very able people

522
00:26:58,587 --> 00:27:00,259
who have studied quangos

523
00:27:00,427 --> 00:27:02,657
and knew the abuses
of the system.

524
00:27:02,907 --> 00:27:06,024
And in the light
of yourknowledge and concern,

525
00:27:06,187 --> 00:27:08,826
Humphrey suggested yourname.

526
00:27:10,547 --> 00:27:13,266
- Didn't you, Humphrey?
- Mr. Weisel, I said.

527
00:27:13,787 --> 00:27:15,937
You're not going to change
my opinions.

528
00:27:16,107 --> 00:27:18,940
- There is such a thing as integrity.
- Of course.

529
00:27:19,107 --> 00:27:21,621
Youropinions and your integrity
would make you

530
00:27:21,787 --> 00:27:23,857
such a valuable member
of this quango.

531
00:27:24,027 --> 00:27:26,461
Mind you,
itwould be very hard work.

532
00:27:27,187 --> 00:27:29,985
Service to this SuperQuango
would involve you

533
00:27:30,147 --> 00:27:33,298
in some very arduous
foreign travel,

534
00:27:34,787 --> 00:27:37,176
to see how these matters
are managed

535
00:27:37,347 --> 00:27:39,542
in other important
government centres.

536
00:27:40,147 --> 00:27:41,899
Japan, Australia,

537
00:27:42,227 --> 00:27:43,785
California,

538
00:27:44,347 --> 00:27:45,826
the West Indies...

539
00:27:46,467 --> 00:27:48,583
- Tahiti...
- Tahiti.

540
00:27:50,947 --> 00:27:53,586
Yes, thatwould be fairly arduous.

541
00:27:53,747 --> 00:27:56,341
Dreadful. Dreadful.

542
00:27:56,947 --> 00:27:59,620
But serving the public's what
it's all about, isn't it?

543
00:27:59,787 --> 00:28:01,425
- Absolutely...
- Serving the public.

544
00:28:01,587 --> 00:28:03,100
Serving the public.

545
00:28:04,347 --> 00:28:06,019
And my quango paper?

546
00:28:06,187 --> 00:28:08,747
Invaluable, take itwith you.

547
00:28:10,667 --> 00:28:15,218
I'll keep a copy,
if I may, on the files.

548
00:28:15,747 --> 00:28:17,624
With the Solihull Report.

549
00:28:18,387 --> 00:28:19,786
Yes, Minister.
