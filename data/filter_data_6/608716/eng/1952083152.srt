1
00:01:11,293 --> 00:01:13,363
-You can't nick the Crown Jewels.
-Why not?

2
00:01:13,453 --> 00:01:15,569
Why not? I'll tell you why not.

3
00:01:15,653 --> 00:01:17,689
Because it's unpatriotic for a start.

4
00:01:17,773 --> 00:01:19,570
Besides which, I don't fancy
being banged up...

5
00:01:19,653 --> 00:01:21,883
in the Tower of London
for the next 300 years.

6
00:01:21,973 --> 00:01:26,012
-For once, I think Danny may have a point.
-Yeah, thank you, Stacie.

7
00:01:26,253 --> 00:01:27,481
What do you mean ''for once''?

8
00:01:27,573 --> 00:01:29,928
If we get caught,
they'll throw away the key, won't they?

9
00:01:30,013 --> 00:01:34,211
Exactly. I'm too pretty to go to prison.
I'll never get any sleep.

10
00:01:35,373 --> 00:01:38,251
Call me old-fashioned,
but I was hoping to avoid getting caught.

11
00:01:38,333 --> 00:01:40,528
We're talking about
the crime of the century.

12
00:01:40,613 --> 00:01:42,922
There's a band of private collectors
who are willing to pay...

13
00:01:43,013 --> 00:01:46,847
a small fortune to add
the First Star of Africa to their collection.

14
00:01:46,933 --> 00:01:49,083
-Can we find them?
-All in hand.

15
00:01:49,653 --> 00:01:51,644
The First Star of Africa.

16
00:01:52,013 --> 00:01:56,052
530.2 carats. Also known
as the Cullinan I...

17
00:01:56,173 --> 00:01:59,370
because it's the largest of the nine stones
cut from the Cullinan diamond...

18
00:01:59,453 --> 00:02:01,887
discovered in South Africa in 1905.

19
00:02:02,573 --> 00:02:05,770
It's now set in the head
of the Royal Scepter.

20
00:02:05,933 --> 00:02:07,924
It is priceless.

21
00:02:08,373 --> 00:02:10,762
Home is the Tower of London.

22
00:02:11,773 --> 00:02:15,243
There has only ever been one attempt
to steal the Crown Jewels.

23
00:02:15,453 --> 00:02:18,206
And that was by Colonel Blood in 1671.

24
00:02:18,413 --> 00:02:20,165
-What happened to him?
-He failed.

25
00:02:20,253 --> 00:02:23,848
Great, so what are we gonna do?
Swim the moat or scale the battlements?

26
00:02:23,933 --> 00:02:26,811
No need.
The Royal Scepter's being moved...

27
00:02:27,053 --> 00:02:29,089
giving us a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity.

28
00:02:29,173 --> 00:02:30,492
Why is it being moved?

29
00:02:30,573 --> 00:02:32,643
Right now it's being cleaned
by the Royal Jewelers...

30
00:02:32,733 --> 00:02:34,963
-and after that it'll be moved again.
-Where?

31
00:02:36,573 --> 00:02:39,963
The Guildhall Art Gallery is holding
a major African exhibition...

32
00:02:40,053 --> 00:02:42,009
to coincide
with the Commonwealth summit.

33
00:02:42,093 --> 00:02:44,527
It starts the day after tomorrow...

34
00:02:45,453 --> 00:02:48,331
and the Star of Africa
is to be the centerpiece.

35
00:02:48,893 --> 00:02:52,044
All right. Think of it.

36
00:02:52,453 --> 00:02:55,365
The biggest score of this century
or the last.

37
00:02:55,453 --> 00:02:59,366
Something that will be remembered
100, even 200 years from now.

38
00:03:01,333 --> 00:03:05,167
Everything I know, everything I've learned
has been waiting for this moment.

39
00:03:07,573 --> 00:03:09,768
Nothing this big
will ever come our way again.

40
00:03:10,333 --> 00:03:13,291
The downside is, if we get caught...

41
00:03:13,813 --> 00:03:17,408
we all go to prison for a very long time.

42
00:03:40,213 --> 00:03:43,364
-You all right, Mick? You on your own?
-Yeah, looks that way.

43
00:03:46,773 --> 00:03:47,808
Cheers.

44
00:04:00,493 --> 00:04:03,291
If I didn't know better,
I'd say you were sulking.

45
00:04:03,613 --> 00:04:05,046
Really?

46
00:04:05,493 --> 00:04:06,892
What did you expect?

47
00:04:06,973 --> 00:04:09,771
You asked them to put
the rest of their lives on the line.

48
00:04:10,333 --> 00:04:11,482
Yes, I did.

49
00:04:11,613 --> 00:04:14,844
You rolled the dice,
they came up snake eyes. It happens.

50
00:04:16,613 --> 00:04:17,887
Yep.

51
00:04:21,573 --> 00:04:23,052
Just tell me one thing.

52
00:04:24,893 --> 00:04:25,962
Why?

53
00:04:27,053 --> 00:04:31,843
Because no one has ever dared attempt
anything this big for 300 years.

54
00:04:31,933 --> 00:04:34,083
-And that's it?
-For me, yes.

55
00:04:37,693 --> 00:04:39,729
Look, this is the biggest game in town.

56
00:04:40,413 --> 00:04:42,688
If we're not here, we're not anywhere.

57
00:04:43,653 --> 00:04:45,132
I can see that.

58
00:04:45,973 --> 00:04:47,292
You see, Mickey...

59
00:04:47,693 --> 00:04:49,968
I had my doubts earlier...

60
00:04:51,133 --> 00:04:52,452
but you can count me in.

61
00:04:54,253 --> 00:04:56,323
Thanks, Danny. That's worth a lot.

62
00:04:56,773 --> 00:04:59,333
But this can't happen
without Stacie and Ash.

63
00:04:59,413 --> 00:05:00,812
Glad to hear it.

64
00:05:01,213 --> 00:05:03,773
-Was he sulking, Albert?
-I'm afraid so, yeah.

65
00:05:03,973 --> 00:05:06,089
-Diddums.
-I was not sulking.

66
00:05:06,173 --> 00:05:08,641
Well, it worked, looks like
you're getting your own way.

67
00:05:08,733 --> 00:05:10,849
No, now, wait a minute, come on.

68
00:05:10,933 --> 00:05:12,924
This thing is far too big
for anyone to be here...

69
00:05:13,013 --> 00:05:14,651
for any other reason than they want to be.

70
00:05:14,733 --> 00:05:15,961
You can't bottle it now.

71
00:05:16,053 --> 00:05:18,567
Cor blimey, first he sulks,
now he's trying to back out.

72
00:05:18,653 --> 00:05:21,042
I'm not backing out, but...

73
00:05:22,013 --> 00:05:25,528
if we do this, we do it with our eyes open.

74
00:05:26,573 --> 00:05:29,406
Hey, if we can't do it...

75
00:05:30,013 --> 00:05:31,366
who can?

76
00:05:32,013 --> 00:05:34,652
-Eddie.
-On the tab.

77
00:05:35,413 --> 00:05:37,768
So, is this a change of direction
for you boys?

78
00:05:37,853 --> 00:05:40,651
-You're thieves now?
-Just trying to earn a living, Benny.

79
00:05:40,733 --> 00:05:43,691
Tell me about it,
there are no honest crooks anymore.

80
00:05:44,173 --> 00:05:45,811
Everyone tries to screw you.

81
00:05:45,893 --> 00:05:49,124
Me, I've been screwed more times
than a coachload of hookers.

82
00:05:49,933 --> 00:05:52,208
I see you still have
a wonderful way with words, Benjamin.

83
00:05:52,293 --> 00:05:54,887
Don't talk to me about words, Mr. Stroller.

84
00:05:55,293 --> 00:05:57,363
Time was a handshake was enough.

85
00:05:57,453 --> 00:06:00,809
Now, everyone's 14,
with spots and rings in their noses...

86
00:06:01,093 --> 00:06:03,607
all using fancy words to screw you.

87
00:06:03,693 --> 00:06:06,332
''Five percent of this. Two pints of that.''

88
00:06:06,613 --> 00:06:09,969
''Ten pence in the pound
and pay you next Wednesday.''

89
00:06:10,093 --> 00:06:13,165
-Yeah, it's a different world.
-That it is.

90
00:06:13,733 --> 00:06:17,772
Me? I've had enough. Next year, I sell up.

91
00:06:18,213 --> 00:06:19,931
Let someone else get screwed.

92
00:06:25,253 --> 00:06:29,292
So. The great Mickey Bricks
and Albert Stroller.

93
00:06:30,413 --> 00:06:34,452
Call me a Chinaman but my guess is
you don't have a bag full of car radios.

94
00:06:35,173 --> 00:06:37,289
-Not quite.
-So what is it?

95
00:06:39,173 --> 00:06:40,731
The Crown Jewels?

96
00:06:46,733 --> 00:06:48,405
Please tell me you're not serious.

97
00:06:48,533 --> 00:06:53,482
What we're looking for are a few select
private collectors to put in sealed bids.

98
00:06:53,773 --> 00:06:56,606
-An auction?
-Winner takes all.

99
00:07:01,693 --> 00:07:02,887
How long have I got?

100
00:07:03,013 --> 00:07:05,925
We've found the cleaning company
who has the contract for the gallery.

101
00:07:06,133 --> 00:07:08,442
They employ
mostly Eastern European workers.

102
00:07:08,533 --> 00:07:11,001
-You mean cheap.
-Precisely.

103
00:07:11,253 --> 00:07:14,290
And you start tonight.
Those are the details.

104
00:07:15,133 --> 00:07:16,282
All right.

105
00:07:16,493 --> 00:07:17,721
-Hello?
-It's me.

106
00:07:17,813 --> 00:07:20,646
-Benny, what have you got for me?
-It wasn't easy.

107
00:07:20,853 --> 00:07:23,811
I have to say that personally,
I think you're insane.

108
00:07:24,173 --> 00:07:27,210
But if you pull it off,
I've got five bidders lined up.

109
00:07:27,373 --> 00:07:29,045
All topnotch.

110
00:07:29,133 --> 00:07:30,566
I knew you were the man for the job.

111
00:07:30,653 --> 00:07:33,087
Sealed bids will be delivered to your hotel.

112
00:07:33,173 --> 00:07:35,164
Okay, Benny, I'll be in touch.

113
00:07:36,733 --> 00:07:38,485
-Well?
-We are on.

114
00:07:38,613 --> 00:07:41,127
Thank you. That's blinding. No.

115
00:07:41,253 --> 00:07:45,804
-No. Believe me, thank you very much.
-Danny, what are you doing?

116
00:07:45,893 --> 00:07:48,851
-Premium phone line, 50 quid a minute.
-What?

117
00:07:48,933 --> 00:07:52,448
I set up one of these lines. Every time
somebody phones this number...

118
00:07:52,533 --> 00:07:54,569
I get 50 quid in me pocket.

119
00:07:54,653 --> 00:07:56,689
But how are you going to get people
to phone the number?

120
00:07:56,773 --> 00:07:59,810
No, listen, this is where
the genius comes in.

121
00:07:59,893 --> 00:08:01,451
'Cause I don't have to, you see.

122
00:08:01,533 --> 00:08:05,287
All I got to do, yeah, is I borrow
a phone and I call the number.

123
00:08:05,373 --> 00:08:08,285
Yeah, then they think
I'm making a 10p call...

124
00:08:08,373 --> 00:08:10,443
but I'm getting 50 big ones in me pocket.

125
00:08:10,533 --> 00:08:11,648
-Danny.
-Yeah, Mickey.

126
00:08:11,733 --> 00:08:13,325
You did stop me using the credit cards.

127
00:08:13,413 --> 00:08:15,688
-They were very bad copies.
-But they did work.

128
00:08:15,773 --> 00:08:17,809
We got thrown out of a restaurant.

129
00:08:17,893 --> 00:08:21,363
Granted, everyone,
but I had a few teething troubles.

130
00:08:21,493 --> 00:08:24,291
Danny, I would much rather you focused
on the job in hand.

131
00:08:24,373 --> 00:08:28,082
I'm focused, gang, I'm focused.
This is just a little sideline.

132
00:08:28,173 --> 00:08:32,246
Make a little bit of money to buy some
tobacco when you get us all arrested.

133
00:08:32,693 --> 00:08:36,288
Eddie, can I borrow your phone, mate?
Just got to phone me old mom.

134
00:08:40,973 --> 00:08:41,962
Hello, Mom?

135
00:08:55,813 --> 00:08:57,326
I'll be watching you.

136
00:09:13,613 --> 00:09:17,526
-I've just made a pot of tea.
-Yes, thank you.

137
00:09:18,133 --> 00:09:19,964
I will just finish my work.

138
00:09:20,213 --> 00:09:22,886
You'll wear the varnish off,
you polish it any more.

139
00:09:22,973 --> 00:09:24,645
But I want to do a good job.

140
00:09:24,733 --> 00:09:28,043
Yes, and you'll do a better job
with a cup of tea inside you.

141
00:09:29,693 --> 00:09:30,967
I be five minute.

142
00:09:31,693 --> 00:09:32,682
Lily.

143
00:09:34,093 --> 00:09:38,166
-What is happening in there?
-Some kind of special exhibition.

144
00:09:38,373 --> 00:09:39,965
All very hush-hush.

145
00:10:34,333 --> 00:10:36,927
-Practicing a few moves.
-And the music?

146
00:10:37,573 --> 00:10:38,688
Get me in the mood.

147
00:10:40,173 --> 00:10:42,448
-It worked for Tom Cruise, didn't it?
-Okay.

148
00:10:42,533 --> 00:10:44,728
I haven't got in the chamber yet,
but from what I've seen...

149
00:10:44,813 --> 00:10:47,566
they've got motion detectors,
lasers, CCTV...

150
00:10:47,653 --> 00:10:50,008
pressure pads and a steel door
with a time lock.

151
00:10:50,093 --> 00:10:52,687
-Belt and braces security then.
-So what's the bottom line?

152
00:10:52,773 --> 00:10:55,333
It would have been easier
if they'd kept it in the Tower of London.

153
00:10:55,413 --> 00:10:57,881
It'll be okay,
we've got Spiderman on board.

154
00:10:57,973 --> 00:11:00,533
Yeah. Let's all have a good laugh.

155
00:11:00,613 --> 00:11:02,968
Listen, I'll be the only one
who's match fit, okay.

156
00:11:03,053 --> 00:11:05,089
Yeah, there's nothing we can do
about the pressure pads.

157
00:11:05,173 --> 00:11:06,367
We'll have to work round them.

158
00:11:06,453 --> 00:11:08,171
The biggest problem, though,
will be the doors.

159
00:11:08,253 --> 00:11:11,211
Once they're shut, there's no other way
of opening them until the morning.

160
00:11:11,293 --> 00:11:13,443
-Can we get in any other way?
-No. It's a sealed room.

161
00:11:13,533 --> 00:11:15,808
-No windows. That's why they chose it.
-Can we tunnel in?

162
00:11:15,893 --> 00:11:17,485
No, that would set off
the motion detectors.

163
00:11:17,573 --> 00:11:21,407
-And there's no way of bypassing them?
-Yeah. If there is, I haven't found it.

164
00:11:21,493 --> 00:11:24,246
So what are you saying, Ash?
We should just call the whole thing off?

165
00:11:24,333 --> 00:11:27,689
No. Just give me a bit more time.
I'll see what I can do.

166
00:11:28,453 --> 00:11:30,091
In the meantime...

167
00:11:31,013 --> 00:11:32,241
I'm late for work.

168
00:11:37,573 --> 00:11:40,167
Yeah.

169
00:11:41,573 --> 00:11:43,211
I'm gonna have to call you back.

170
00:12:23,293 --> 00:12:24,328
Hello, Benny.

171
00:12:35,053 --> 00:12:38,204
This is an inventory
of what was found in your warehouse.

172
00:12:38,733 --> 00:12:40,769
And this is a list of items reported stolen...

173
00:12:40,853 --> 00:12:43,572
in the Greater London area
over the past seven days.

174
00:12:44,013 --> 00:12:47,892
-As you can see they're virtually identical.
-I bought every item there in good faith.

175
00:12:47,973 --> 00:12:51,010
In which case
you'll have receipts, invoices.

176
00:12:51,413 --> 00:12:53,005
Names and addresses of suppliers.

177
00:12:53,093 --> 00:12:55,084
-We had a fire.
-Oh, yes.

178
00:12:56,453 --> 00:12:57,647
Of course you did.

179
00:12:58,293 --> 00:13:00,249
Crime report.

180
00:13:01,013 --> 00:13:02,969
A container-Ioad of computer equipment...

181
00:13:03,053 --> 00:13:05,613
was stolen from the docks
three weeks ago.

182
00:13:05,973 --> 00:13:08,043
They found the container
yesterday morning.

183
00:13:08,693 --> 00:13:10,285
Someone had tried to burn it.

184
00:13:10,533 --> 00:13:13,889
Kids these days. No discipline.

185
00:13:16,013 --> 00:13:17,412
The fire went out.

186
00:13:18,173 --> 00:13:20,368
We dusted for prints...

187
00:13:21,053 --> 00:13:22,930
and you'll never guess what we found.

188
00:13:25,013 --> 00:13:26,207
Perfect match.

189
00:13:27,173 --> 00:13:29,607
Bang to rights, Benny.

190
00:13:31,973 --> 00:13:35,886
-How long, Mr. Wells?
-With your form, fifteen years.

191
00:13:36,813 --> 00:13:39,725
You take a guilty, you might get 12.

192
00:13:41,893 --> 00:13:43,087
Well?

193
00:13:49,133 --> 00:13:50,486
Wait.

194
00:13:54,013 --> 00:13:57,562
-What about a deal?
-What kind of deal?

195
00:13:57,733 --> 00:14:00,293
The imminent robbery
of the Crown Jewels.

196
00:14:05,573 --> 00:14:08,212
-You saw how magnificent--
-You said it seven times.

197
00:14:08,293 --> 00:14:10,170
-No.
-Mr. Morgan.

198
00:14:10,933 --> 00:14:13,163
I'm sorry to bother you,
only the manager wondered...

199
00:14:13,253 --> 00:14:15,608
whether you could
bring your account up-to-date?

200
00:14:16,613 --> 00:14:18,126
-It is rather a lot.
-Yeah, it is.

201
00:14:18,213 --> 00:14:19,202
-I didn't have that.
-You did.

202
00:14:19,293 --> 00:14:20,965
-Did you have that?
-I didn't, I don't like--

203
00:14:21,053 --> 00:14:23,283
-Who had that?
-Enough. It's not a problem.

204
00:14:23,533 --> 00:14:24,886
Hey.

205
00:14:25,453 --> 00:14:28,365
Put your hand in there, mate.
Keep it in there, I'll get this.

206
00:14:28,453 --> 00:14:31,126
-Thank you.
-All right, you're very welcome.

207
00:14:31,493 --> 00:14:34,405
Listen, love, while you put that
through the old switcherooney...

208
00:14:34,493 --> 00:14:35,926
-can I use your phone?
-Of course.

209
00:14:36,013 --> 00:14:37,412
Got to phone me old mom.

210
00:14:45,213 --> 00:14:46,328
Hello, Mom?

211
00:15:34,653 --> 00:15:36,291
You shouldn't be in here.

212
00:15:38,293 --> 00:15:40,284
But I have to do floors.

213
00:15:40,373 --> 00:15:43,524
Not in here, sweetheart.
They're bringing other people in.

214
00:15:45,213 --> 00:15:46,692
I am sorry.

215
00:15:51,573 --> 00:15:54,645
I can see I'll have
to keep an eye on you. Come on.

216
00:15:55,773 --> 00:15:58,731
Come and have a cuppa.
You can try my Bourbons.

217
00:16:05,293 --> 00:16:07,090
-Mick.
-Hey.

218
00:16:07,573 --> 00:16:10,133
-How's it going?
-I've got blisters on me blisters.

219
00:16:10,213 --> 00:16:12,807
-No gain without pain.
-Yeah, right. Thank you.

220
00:16:12,973 --> 00:16:15,692
Look, I think I've got it.
There's a safety feature on the door.

221
00:16:15,773 --> 00:16:19,049
The time lock's got a panel on the inside,
in case anyone gets locked in.

222
00:16:19,133 --> 00:16:20,168
So can we use that?

223
00:16:20,253 --> 00:16:22,767
If we can get someone inside
before they close it.

224
00:16:22,853 --> 00:16:24,525
Hey, haven't you lot
got any homes to go to?

225
00:16:24,613 --> 00:16:27,127
-Just a few more minutes, Eddie.
-Yeah, come on.

226
00:16:27,213 --> 00:16:29,681
-I need my beauty sleep.
-Yeah, I'll second that.

227
00:16:30,453 --> 00:16:32,250
-Do you want a drink?
-Won't you be lucky?

228
00:16:34,053 --> 00:16:36,647
Eddie, I just want to say...

229
00:16:36,733 --> 00:16:39,884
that I really appreciate you hanging on
while Ash and I work something through.

230
00:16:39,973 --> 00:16:43,727
-Yeah, I know, Mick, but it's really late--
-Look, I'll tell you what, okay.

231
00:16:43,813 --> 00:16:45,212
We'll just have one more drink...

232
00:16:45,293 --> 00:16:47,966
and I promise,
we'll be out of your hair really soon.

233
00:16:48,053 --> 00:16:49,372
What do you say?

234
00:16:50,213 --> 00:16:52,647
Come on, we'll be gone by 1:00.

235
00:16:52,933 --> 00:16:54,571
No, but it's gone on....

236
00:16:56,093 --> 00:16:58,163
I could have sworn it was later than that.

237
00:17:01,573 --> 00:17:04,087
-Go on, then, one more.
-You're a star.

238
00:17:06,973 --> 00:17:09,248
Right, come on,
tell me about this safety feature.

239
00:17:14,173 --> 00:17:15,162
Sir?

240
00:17:15,653 --> 00:17:17,371
-DS Hodges?
-Yes, sir.

241
00:17:18,013 --> 00:17:22,131
Your DI tells me you were working
on a case last year. Michael Stone?

242
00:17:27,853 --> 00:17:30,321
Look, we had Stone under surveillance.

243
00:17:30,653 --> 00:17:31,847
But he found out somehow.

244
00:17:31,933 --> 00:17:35,084
And drafted in another grifter
to impersonate a police officer.

245
00:17:35,173 --> 00:17:36,925
And the case collapsed?

246
00:17:37,653 --> 00:17:40,247
Stone's man ran the investigation, sir.

247
00:17:40,893 --> 00:17:42,963
Must have been
very embarrassing for you.

248
00:17:43,413 --> 00:17:45,688
It was embarrassing
for the whole department, sir.

249
00:17:45,773 --> 00:17:48,810
-DCI Mullens lost his job because of it.
-Did he, now?

250
00:17:53,133 --> 00:17:54,691
So....

251
00:17:59,373 --> 00:18:01,250
Tell me about Stone.

252
00:18:01,333 --> 00:18:04,689
-Long con artist--
-No. I know what he does.

253
00:18:05,653 --> 00:18:06,881
Tell me about the man.

254
00:18:08,973 --> 00:18:10,884
Mickey Stone is unique.

255
00:18:11,013 --> 00:18:14,050
He doesn't think like we do.
You can't second-guess him.

256
00:18:14,573 --> 00:18:17,485
He gives the impression
that he's making it all up as he goes along.

257
00:18:17,573 --> 00:18:18,608
No.

258
00:18:19,253 --> 00:18:21,972
But everything is planned, precise.

259
00:18:22,053 --> 00:18:24,328
-Why me?
-You drew the short straw.

260
00:18:25,333 --> 00:18:27,005
I demand a recount.

261
00:18:31,453 --> 00:18:33,205
So when you gonna push me--

262
00:18:33,293 --> 00:18:34,885
He puts together complicated...

263
00:18:34,973 --> 00:18:37,965
and seemingly unrelated events,
impossible to unravel.

264
00:18:38,053 --> 00:18:39,168
Waiter, I'll have one of those.

265
00:18:39,253 --> 00:18:41,528
But all leading to the big con.

266
00:18:41,653 --> 00:18:44,213
The higher the stakes, the more he likes it.

267
00:18:44,293 --> 00:18:45,362
Yes, it has been long.

268
00:18:45,453 --> 00:18:47,011
Just when you think you've got him...

269
00:18:47,093 --> 00:18:48,731
I've got a job for you.

270
00:18:49,573 --> 00:18:51,325
Are you sitting down?

271
00:18:52,773 --> 00:18:56,288
-...you haven't.
-You sound like a bit of a fan.

272
00:18:56,693 --> 00:19:00,129
Hardly, sir, he made me look
like an incompetent idiot.

273
00:19:02,813 --> 00:19:04,963
Then how would you like
to get your own back?

274
00:19:09,293 --> 00:19:12,251
Oh, God! Sorry.

275
00:19:12,413 --> 00:19:14,529
I tell you now,
I've definitely caught something.

276
00:19:14,613 --> 00:19:18,447
Okay, this thing isn't going to work unless
we can get someone inside the gallery...

277
00:19:18,533 --> 00:19:20,808
and in the exhibition room
when the doors are locked.

278
00:19:20,893 --> 00:19:24,203
Once they're locked for the night, the
doors can only be opened from the inside.

279
00:19:24,293 --> 00:19:26,011
-Which is where you come in.
-How?

280
00:19:26,093 --> 00:19:27,128
Ash.

281
00:19:27,533 --> 00:19:30,491
We can get round the pressure pads
by going over the top.

282
00:19:30,573 --> 00:19:33,133
The main problem, though,
aside from the time lock on the door...

283
00:19:33,213 --> 00:19:35,727
will be the lasers
and the motion detectors.

284
00:19:36,253 --> 00:19:38,926
Like I said, there's no way
we can bypass them...

285
00:19:39,013 --> 00:19:41,732
and they'll set the alarms off
as soon as we set foot in the room.

286
00:19:41,813 --> 00:19:45,010
-Solution?
-The only way round it as far as I can see...

287
00:19:45,093 --> 00:19:47,766
-is to cut the power.
-Won't that set the alarms off?

288
00:19:47,853 --> 00:19:50,413
Yeah, but if we do it outside
somewhere in the road...

289
00:19:50,493 --> 00:19:51,642
we'll knock out the whole street.

290
00:19:51,733 --> 00:19:54,088
-There'll be alarms going off everywhere.
-Smart.

291
00:19:54,373 --> 00:19:57,968
During that time, we'll have 30 seconds
to cover up the motion detectors...

292
00:19:58,053 --> 00:20:01,090
and get to the door panel to stop
the lasers from coming back on.

293
00:20:02,733 --> 00:20:05,042
-Will that be enough time?
-It'll have to be.

294
00:20:05,133 --> 00:20:08,045
Once the genny kicks in, the lasers
and everything else will be back on.

295
00:20:08,133 --> 00:20:09,202
CCTV?

296
00:20:09,293 --> 00:20:11,284
I can re-route those at source
during the blackout.

297
00:20:11,373 --> 00:20:14,365
-Good.
-So, what do I have to do then?

298
00:20:14,813 --> 00:20:18,408
The motion detectors and the lasers
have to be disabled from the inside...

299
00:20:18,853 --> 00:20:20,206
before we open the door.

300
00:20:22,093 --> 00:20:25,563
The exhibition has five main exhibitors.

301
00:20:26,253 --> 00:20:29,962
The biggest of which is Joyce Martin.

302
00:20:30,053 --> 00:20:32,851
So what is your area of expertise?

303
00:20:33,413 --> 00:20:36,849
I absolutely adore the Urhobo pieces
from the Niger Delta.

304
00:20:36,933 --> 00:20:39,606
Particularly the Iphri carved figures.

305
00:20:40,213 --> 00:20:42,443
But, aside from the traditional...

306
00:20:42,533 --> 00:20:45,730
I've always had a deep affection for
some of the more contemporary pieces...

307
00:20:45,813 --> 00:20:49,567
such as Bruce Onobrakpeya's
epoxy resin etchings.

308
00:20:49,853 --> 00:20:51,605
Completely stunning.

309
00:21:10,933 --> 00:21:12,651
Who's been using my phone?

310
00:21:20,893 --> 00:21:23,691
-Mick, can I say something?
-Yeah, of course.

311
00:21:24,293 --> 00:21:27,171
-I've got a really bad feeling about this.
-How so?

312
00:21:27,493 --> 00:21:30,849
-I don't know, it just feels....
-Foolhardy?

313
00:21:31,253 --> 00:21:32,766
Yeah, that'll do for a start.

314
00:21:33,213 --> 00:21:36,091
Ash, this is the biggest thing
we've ever done.

315
00:21:36,733 --> 00:21:39,884
-It was never gonna be easy.
-Yeah, but there's so much can go wrong.

316
00:21:39,973 --> 00:21:42,441
I know, but it won't. It won't.

317
00:21:45,533 --> 00:21:47,205
Okay, say it.

318
00:21:47,893 --> 00:21:49,724
Don't get me wrong,
I'm not criticizing you.

319
00:21:49,813 --> 00:21:51,451
I think you're a flaming genius.

320
00:21:52,013 --> 00:21:55,210
-But I have to say what I think.
-And you think this is a bad idea.

321
00:21:55,653 --> 00:21:57,052
It's what me gut says.

322
00:22:12,253 --> 00:22:15,962
Hello, sweetheart. New face.
How you doing?

323
00:22:17,573 --> 00:22:20,087
Thank you very much. Goodbye.

324
00:22:25,533 --> 00:22:26,568
Bids are in.

325
00:22:26,653 --> 00:22:28,848
And Albie called, everything is set his end.

326
00:22:28,933 --> 00:22:30,002
Joyce Martin?

327
00:22:30,093 --> 00:22:33,290
She's put me in charge of the items
going on show at the exhibition.

328
00:22:34,973 --> 00:22:36,247
So are we good to go?

329
00:22:42,053 --> 00:22:44,362
Yeah. Tomorrow night.

330
00:22:47,373 --> 00:22:49,728
The diamond,
it'll be delivered to the gallery...

331
00:22:49,813 --> 00:22:52,043
under armed guard tomorrow morning.

332
00:22:54,253 --> 00:22:57,609
We know that Mickey Bricks
and his team...

333
00:22:58,573 --> 00:23:00,086
are going to steal it.

334
00:23:00,173 --> 00:23:02,528
This is the first time
that we've got a head start.

335
00:23:02,613 --> 00:23:05,002
There is no way
they can know we're onto them.

336
00:23:05,093 --> 00:23:08,449
-We must use that.
-Okay, we know they're smart.

337
00:23:09,373 --> 00:23:11,125
So no surveillance.

338
00:23:11,893 --> 00:23:14,851
I won't risk them getting wind
of this operation.

339
00:23:16,453 --> 00:23:18,489
Which means
that we simply watch the gallery...

340
00:23:18,573 --> 00:23:20,404
and wait for them to make their move.

341
00:23:22,453 --> 00:23:25,172
-Does everyone understand that?
-Yes, guv.

342
00:23:26,813 --> 00:23:30,123
This team has made us
look like fools too many times.

343
00:23:35,013 --> 00:23:36,287
This time it's our turn.

344
00:23:49,853 --> 00:23:52,413
I've found a place to cut off the power,
but there's a problem.

345
00:23:52,493 --> 00:23:55,007
-What?
-I can't be in two places at once.

346
00:23:55,493 --> 00:23:57,131
At the same time
the power is being cut off...

347
00:23:57,213 --> 00:23:59,773
someone has to be re-routing
the feed to the CCTV cameras.

348
00:23:59,853 --> 00:24:01,445
Can't you show someone how to do that?

349
00:24:01,533 --> 00:24:04,331
No, it's best if I do it.
Someone else can do the electricity.

350
00:24:04,413 --> 00:24:06,973
-Okay, show Danny.
-Me? No.

351
00:24:07,493 --> 00:24:09,961
No, I have trouble wiring a plug.

352
00:24:10,053 --> 00:24:12,886
It's all right. I'll talk you through it.
We can use walkie-talkies.

353
00:24:12,973 --> 00:24:16,409
-Okay, I'll do it.
-Stacie, how you getting on at the gallery?

354
00:24:16,893 --> 00:24:18,611
I've found a piece that's perfect.

355
00:24:18,933 --> 00:24:20,764
-Albert?
-Everything will be ready.

356
00:24:20,853 --> 00:24:23,811
Okay, the exhibition opens tomorrow.
So let's get some sleep.

357
00:24:39,973 --> 00:24:43,283
We'll come in here. There'll be four guards
in the control room.

358
00:24:43,373 --> 00:24:44,647
One will be doing his rounds.

359
00:24:44,733 --> 00:24:48,487
Yeah, there's no set time, so the chances
are we'll have to get past him.

360
00:24:48,573 --> 00:24:49,608
That done...

361
00:24:49,693 --> 00:24:52,048
Ash will give the signal
to Danny to cut the power...

362
00:24:52,133 --> 00:24:55,603
which will give us
30 seconds to re-route the CCTV...

363
00:24:55,773 --> 00:24:57,650
and for Stacie to do her thing.

364
00:24:57,733 --> 00:25:01,089
You must get to the door
before the emergency power kicks in.

365
00:25:01,213 --> 00:25:03,283
-Okay.
-Or you'll be trapped by the lasers.

366
00:25:04,613 --> 00:25:07,252
When you've done that,
we should be on the other side.

367
00:25:08,773 --> 00:25:10,172
I'd better go.

368
00:25:15,093 --> 00:25:17,323
-Albert?
-Second floor.

369
00:25:17,613 --> 00:25:20,207
And you must be on time.

370
00:25:20,453 --> 00:25:23,251
We will. Any questions?

371
00:25:24,133 --> 00:25:26,124
-No.
-Then let's go.

372
00:26:10,613 --> 00:26:12,604
Thanks for listening, sweetheart.

373
00:26:31,053 --> 00:26:33,169
Radio silence until further notice.

374
00:26:35,653 --> 00:26:36,972
Cleaning team.

375
00:26:37,973 --> 00:26:39,611
On time.

376
00:27:19,133 --> 00:27:21,169
-You okay, Mick?
-Yeah.

377
00:27:21,293 --> 00:27:22,646
Put that back in me bag.

378
00:27:24,933 --> 00:27:26,161
All right.

379
00:28:41,173 --> 00:28:43,209
Maybe they're not going to do it tonight.

380
00:28:50,773 --> 00:28:52,092
Now what do I do?

381
00:28:55,773 --> 00:28:58,128
-Okay.
-All right.

382
00:28:59,573 --> 00:29:02,565
-Come on, baby. There we go.
-All right.

383
00:29:12,773 --> 00:29:13,842
We're on, Mick.

384
00:29:16,933 --> 00:29:19,891
Now we'll tape it for a while
and then feed the tape through on a loop.

385
00:29:19,973 --> 00:29:21,247
Okay.

386
00:29:24,693 --> 00:29:27,412
-Danny, come in.
-Ready, over.

387
00:29:28,013 --> 00:29:29,492
Okay, that should be enough.

388
00:29:31,373 --> 00:29:32,522
Danny?

389
00:29:32,733 --> 00:29:34,291
Have you got the box in place?

390
00:29:35,133 --> 00:29:36,122
Hang on.

391
00:29:40,613 --> 00:29:42,763
Yeah, I got the box in place.

392
00:29:42,853 --> 00:29:44,605
When you put the clips on,
nothing will happen.

393
00:29:44,693 --> 00:29:46,729
Then after 10 seconds,
the power will cut out.

394
00:29:46,813 --> 00:29:48,769
Take the crocodile clips
and clip them both on the--

395
00:29:48,853 --> 00:29:50,684
Vinny, where are you, mate?

396
00:29:51,653 --> 00:29:54,213
I've got a pick up
at 19 Chapel Road, West One.

397
00:29:54,293 --> 00:29:55,931
Hello, you're on my frequency.

398
00:29:56,013 --> 00:29:58,607
I think you'll find
you're on mine actually, darling.

399
00:29:59,613 --> 00:30:01,888
Just get off the line, you dozy cow.

400
00:30:02,013 --> 00:30:04,288
Don't you use that tone with me
or you won't get a cab.

401
00:30:04,373 --> 00:30:06,568
I don't want a bleeding cab.
Just get off the line.

402
00:30:06,653 --> 00:30:09,167
-Who's that, Mary?
-Some bloke messing about.

403
00:30:11,333 --> 00:30:13,051
-Danny?
-Ash?

404
00:30:23,613 --> 00:30:26,411
It's always the red. It's always red, isn't it?

405
00:30:26,493 --> 00:30:29,371
Come on. Or is it blue? Is it blue?

406
00:30:29,453 --> 00:30:30,602
Blue or red?

407
00:30:32,293 --> 00:30:33,806
Red.

408
00:30:48,733 --> 00:30:50,052
What the....

409
00:30:51,253 --> 00:30:54,882
Good boy. Come on, Stace.
You got 30 seconds.

410
00:31:08,413 --> 00:31:10,529
12 elephant, 13 elephant.

411
00:31:13,453 --> 00:31:14,852
16 elephant.

412
00:31:18,093 --> 00:31:19,162
20 elephant.

413
00:31:19,253 --> 00:31:20,891
Twenty. Twenty-one.

414
00:31:23,213 --> 00:31:25,283
25, 26 elephant.

415
00:31:28,893 --> 00:31:30,690
30. Shit.

416
00:31:36,333 --> 00:31:37,971
Good. Okay.

417
00:32:02,173 --> 00:32:04,528
CCTV returned. It's all back up again.

418
00:32:05,653 --> 00:32:07,211
-All secured.
-Okay.

419
00:32:07,293 --> 00:32:08,487
Hello?

420
00:32:10,933 --> 00:32:12,651
Let's hope Stacie's done her stuff.

421
00:32:13,973 --> 00:32:15,611
-Right, let's go?
-Yeah.

422
00:32:35,973 --> 00:32:37,008
Thank you.

423
00:32:37,293 --> 00:32:41,286
External power cut. It wasn't
just the gallery, the whole sector was out.

424
00:32:41,373 --> 00:32:42,442
Security?

425
00:32:42,533 --> 00:32:45,127
The emergency power is on
and alarms have re-armed.

426
00:32:45,213 --> 00:32:46,851
What do you want to do?

427
00:32:52,613 --> 00:32:53,841
Hold your positions.

428
00:32:56,093 --> 00:32:57,845
I want to know if they're in there.

429
00:33:26,013 --> 00:33:28,732
What's she doing?
She should have opened the door by now.

430
00:33:55,973 --> 00:33:57,565
Something must have gone wrong.

431
00:34:26,933 --> 00:34:28,412
Come on, Stacie.

432
00:34:39,133 --> 00:34:40,327
What kept you?

433
00:34:41,013 --> 00:34:42,651
Watch the pressure pads.

434
00:34:49,893 --> 00:34:52,532
Everything beyond this point
is a pressure pad.

435
00:34:53,093 --> 00:34:55,402
If we touch them,
the alarms go off, all right?

436
00:35:23,413 --> 00:35:25,290
-You ready, Mick?
-Let's go.

437
00:35:25,373 --> 00:35:26,442
Stace.

438
00:36:03,093 --> 00:36:04,242
Carry on.

439
00:36:16,093 --> 00:36:18,243
Down.

440
00:36:19,733 --> 00:36:21,052
Stop.

441
00:36:37,093 --> 00:36:38,731
Hello, news desk, please.

442
00:36:46,413 --> 00:36:47,687
Lift.

443
00:36:59,493 --> 00:37:00,972
Okay, down.

444
00:37:08,933 --> 00:37:10,207
Stop.

445
00:37:13,973 --> 00:37:17,249
-Okay, any time now would be good.
-Yeah.

446
00:37:22,853 --> 00:37:24,411
One for the scrapbook.

447
00:37:43,933 --> 00:37:47,130
-That's the cleaner's van again.
-Shit, they must have been in the first van.

448
00:37:47,213 --> 00:37:50,046
-Go.
-Hit the alarms! Hit the alarms!

449
00:38:18,893 --> 00:38:20,121
I knew it.

450
00:38:28,293 --> 00:38:30,284
-Who the hell are you?
-I'm with The Times.

451
00:38:30,373 --> 00:38:32,125
We just received a call about a break-in.

452
00:38:32,213 --> 00:38:33,965
-Get her out!
-Yeah, okay, just one minute.

453
00:38:34,053 --> 00:38:35,691
-How many do you think were involved?
-Please.

454
00:38:35,773 --> 00:38:37,252
Any ideas?

455
00:38:38,173 --> 00:38:39,526
Stay out.

456
00:38:44,533 --> 00:38:47,331
There's no way they got out
through any of the exits.

457
00:38:54,853 --> 00:38:55,968
The roof.

458
00:39:44,053 --> 00:39:45,372
Hey.

459
00:39:48,973 --> 00:39:50,372
Shit.

460
00:40:28,093 --> 00:40:29,731
Quiet.

461
00:40:40,453 --> 00:40:41,727
Do you mind?

462
00:40:47,933 --> 00:40:49,161
Dress.

463
00:41:08,933 --> 00:41:10,082
They disappeared.

464
00:41:11,253 --> 00:41:13,562
-Roadblocks?
-They could be anywhere now.

465
00:41:16,053 --> 00:41:17,566
Okay.

466
00:41:19,493 --> 00:41:21,609
-It doesn't matter.
-What?

467
00:41:22,693 --> 00:41:23,842
Think about it.

468
00:41:25,213 --> 00:41:26,726
We know it was them.

469
00:41:28,093 --> 00:41:29,970
But they have no way of knowing that.

470
00:41:30,053 --> 00:41:33,204
-Which means?
-They don't know we're looking for them.

471
00:41:33,573 --> 00:41:36,246
I will bet you one year's salary...

472
00:41:37,253 --> 00:41:40,131
-they turn up back at the hotel.
-They wouldn't be that stupid.

473
00:41:40,213 --> 00:41:41,566
Why not?

474
00:41:42,013 --> 00:41:44,322
As far as they're concerned,
they've got clean away.

475
00:41:49,653 --> 00:41:52,850
-I still think they'll be long gone.
-We'll see.

476
00:41:55,813 --> 00:41:57,132
Guv?

477
00:41:57,893 --> 00:41:59,167
Yes.

478
00:41:59,973 --> 00:42:04,046
Black cab just about to pass you,
five people inside. I think it's them.

479
00:42:05,253 --> 00:42:06,811
Hold your positions.

480
00:42:16,093 --> 00:42:17,811
Wait for my signal.

481
00:42:26,973 --> 00:42:28,565
That is what I call a great night.

482
00:42:28,653 --> 00:42:31,292
I don't know about the rest of you,
the old man's gonna hit the sack.

483
00:42:31,373 --> 00:42:32,726
-Yeah, I think I'll join you.
-Really?

484
00:42:32,813 --> 00:42:35,532
No. I don't mean I'm gonna join you.
I'm gonna have me own bed.

485
00:42:35,613 --> 00:42:37,763
-I had no idea you cared.
-I do care, I love you, Albert.

486
00:42:37,853 --> 00:42:40,413
-You said you loved me. Oh, my God!
-Shut up.

487
00:42:40,493 --> 00:42:43,405
Listen, you lot do what you want, all right,
'cause I'm gonna get a drink.

488
00:42:43,493 --> 00:42:46,212
'Cause I've had
a very traumatic couple of days.

489
00:42:46,813 --> 00:42:48,565
Come on, then, I'll keep you company.

490
00:42:52,373 --> 00:42:53,886
Eye, eye.

491
00:42:55,893 --> 00:42:57,690
Stand still. Don't move.

492
00:43:01,013 --> 00:43:03,652
-What's going on?
-You're all under arrest.

493
00:43:04,813 --> 00:43:06,212
For what?

494
00:43:09,173 --> 00:43:11,209
Suspicion of theft.

495
00:43:12,973 --> 00:43:16,852
I'm sorry, I have no idea
what you're talking about.

496
00:43:18,373 --> 00:43:19,772
Take them away.

497
00:43:20,733 --> 00:43:21,722
This way, please, sir.

498
00:43:21,813 --> 00:43:24,373
...it may harm your defense
if you do not mention when questioned...

499
00:43:24,453 --> 00:43:26,284
something that you later rely on in court.

500
00:43:26,373 --> 00:43:28,648
Anything you do say
may be given in evidence.

501
00:43:28,733 --> 00:43:31,725
I'm a friend of the police commissioner.
If you'd just call him.

502
00:43:41,933 --> 00:43:44,367
Bang to rights, Mickey, party's over.

503
00:43:48,813 --> 00:43:49,928
Wait in line.

504
00:43:52,173 --> 00:43:53,652
I want to speak to my brief.

505
00:43:53,733 --> 00:43:55,769
In good time, just stand there.

506
00:43:58,693 --> 00:44:00,524
All right, who's first?

507
00:44:06,333 --> 00:44:08,608
He's been arrested on suspicion of theft...

508
00:44:08,693 --> 00:44:11,446
at the Guildhall Gallery
at 10:30 this evening.

509
00:44:12,733 --> 00:44:14,610
-Name?
-Ashley Morgan.

510
00:44:15,893 --> 00:44:18,487
-Date of birth?
-21/7/60.

511
00:44:18,933 --> 00:44:22,084
-Address?
-The Lexington Hotel.

512
00:44:22,613 --> 00:44:24,285
Empty your pockets out, will you, please?

513
00:44:30,613 --> 00:44:32,012
You've forgotten something?

514
00:44:42,893 --> 00:44:44,645
-Get this developed.
-Sir.

515
00:44:44,933 --> 00:44:46,048
Take your tie off.

516
00:44:47,333 --> 00:44:48,527
Number three.

517
00:44:48,893 --> 00:44:52,203
Not quite as comfortable as the Lexington,
but you'll have to make do.

518
00:44:53,573 --> 00:44:54,801
All right, who's next?

519
00:45:01,733 --> 00:45:03,769
Police chiefs have just confirmed...

520
00:45:03,853 --> 00:45:06,321
that five suspects have been detained
for the theft...

521
00:45:06,413 --> 00:45:10,691
of one of the world's best known
diamonds, the First Star of Africa.

522
00:45:10,933 --> 00:45:14,209
The priceless diamond,
which usually adorns the Royal Scepter...

523
00:45:14,293 --> 00:45:17,171
was recently moved from
the Tower of London, to be placed...

524
00:45:17,253 --> 00:45:21,371
as the centerpiece in a special public
exhibition at the Guildhall Gallery.

525
00:45:31,733 --> 00:45:34,566
Resuming interview with Michael Stone.

526
00:45:35,933 --> 00:45:38,049
9:13 a.m.

527
00:45:38,413 --> 00:45:41,450
So, Mickey, you've had
a bit of time to think.

528
00:45:41,533 --> 00:45:44,525
-Yeah.
-Is there anything you'd like to tell us?

529
00:45:46,573 --> 00:45:49,849
-Nothing springs to mind.
-Then I will ask you again.

530
00:45:50,293 --> 00:45:54,411
Can you tell me again
where you were at 10:30 last night?

531
00:45:54,933 --> 00:45:58,130
-It's slipped my mind.
-It's less than 12 hours ago.

532
00:45:58,213 --> 00:46:00,204
Yeah, I know, I've got a terrible memory.

533
00:46:00,293 --> 00:46:02,170
10:30?

534
00:46:04,093 --> 00:46:07,085
I remember. No, it's gone again.

535
00:46:07,173 --> 00:46:09,084
I'm terribly sorry, but my....

536
00:46:11,133 --> 00:46:15,923
What's the word? Memory.
It isn't quite what it was, you see.

537
00:46:17,013 --> 00:46:18,651
What were you saying?

538
00:46:23,413 --> 00:46:24,482
Any chance of a fag?

539
00:46:24,573 --> 00:46:28,646
A robbery? How thrilling.
Have you caught anyone yet?

540
00:46:29,773 --> 00:46:31,092
Thank you, sweetheart.

541
00:46:34,773 --> 00:46:38,368
Look, I really have no idea
what you're talking about, Officer.

542
00:46:40,253 --> 00:46:44,166
Interview suspended, 9:18 a.m.

543
00:46:49,693 --> 00:46:52,127
-Where's the diamond, Mickey?
-Is that allowed?

544
00:46:52,213 --> 00:46:54,443
Where's the bloody diamond?

545
00:46:54,733 --> 00:46:55,802
What?

546
00:46:57,533 --> 00:46:59,171
Can I have a word, guv?

547
00:47:03,373 --> 00:47:07,332
You might think you're clever,
but I know you did this.

548
00:47:08,333 --> 00:47:10,244
And I'm going to put you away.

549
00:47:11,333 --> 00:47:14,211
-With or without the diamond.
-Sir?

550
00:47:22,613 --> 00:47:24,444
I think you better see this.

551
00:47:30,493 --> 00:47:33,212
It's the film we took
from Morgan's camera.

552
00:47:44,373 --> 00:47:47,843
Testing. One, two, three, four.
Can you hear me at the back?

553
00:47:47,933 --> 00:47:50,686
Ladies and gentlemen, welcome
to the Police Courage Awards.

554
00:47:50,773 --> 00:47:53,003
Would you please make your way
towards your seats.

555
00:47:53,093 --> 00:47:56,085
And the ceremonies will begin
very shortly. Thank you.

556
00:47:57,693 --> 00:48:01,845
And now the last of tonight's
civilian awards goes to a late entry.

557
00:48:01,933 --> 00:48:05,050
Someone who was brought
to the Commissioner's attention...

558
00:48:05,133 --> 00:48:06,964
only a few days ago.

559
00:48:10,293 --> 00:48:11,726
Thank you.

560
00:48:12,973 --> 00:48:14,929
Waiter, I'll have one of those.

561
00:48:20,453 --> 00:48:23,684
A man who, without any thought
for his own safety...

562
00:48:23,773 --> 00:48:26,128
saved the life of a fellow rambler.

563
00:48:26,613 --> 00:48:30,925
Michael Stone and the man
who's life he saved, Daniel Blue.

564
00:48:39,373 --> 00:48:41,125
I was leaning down.

565
00:48:41,813 --> 00:48:45,772
There was an injured duck, you see.

566
00:48:45,853 --> 00:48:49,243
So there I was just trying to help...

567
00:48:49,813 --> 00:48:53,647
just help the little fellow,
when suddenly, I lost me footing...

568
00:48:53,733 --> 00:48:57,772
and the next thing I knew,
I was in the water.

569
00:48:58,373 --> 00:49:00,887
-Why me?
-You drew the short straw.

570
00:49:01,693 --> 00:49:03,411
I demand a recount.

571
00:49:07,773 --> 00:49:09,525
So when you gonna push me--

572
00:49:10,013 --> 00:49:12,573
I was drowning. Definitely drowning.

573
00:49:12,893 --> 00:49:14,485
-I can't swim. Help.
-Hey.

574
00:49:14,573 --> 00:49:18,452
My whole life started flashing before me...

575
00:49:19,533 --> 00:49:20,886
I'd just left school...

576
00:49:20,973 --> 00:49:25,091
and I felt a strong hand pulling me up.

577
00:49:26,093 --> 00:49:28,482
There he is, there he is.

578
00:49:29,573 --> 00:49:30,972
It was Mr. Stone.

579
00:49:32,053 --> 00:49:34,089
He...

580
00:49:35,893 --> 00:49:37,849
saved my life. Thank you.

581
00:49:56,493 --> 00:49:57,562
Doesn't mean anything.

582
00:49:57,653 --> 00:50:01,043
We've got nothing to place them
at the scene and no diamond.

583
00:50:01,613 --> 00:50:04,446
-They've hidden it.
-It gets worse.

584
00:50:05,013 --> 00:50:08,449
We know the diamond was stolen
half a mile from the ceremony at 10:30.

585
00:50:10,213 --> 00:50:11,885
The Commissioner's watch.

586
00:50:24,933 --> 00:50:26,810
It says 10:20.

587
00:51:14,773 --> 00:51:16,172
You've forgotten something.

588
00:51:26,013 --> 00:51:27,366
That's....

589
00:51:29,333 --> 00:51:31,164
That's not possible.

590
00:51:34,853 --> 00:51:38,766
And then just at the end,
they add the little sprinkles on top.

591
00:51:40,173 --> 00:51:42,482
And that's what makes it a mochaccino.

592
00:51:45,333 --> 00:51:48,006
-You're free to go.
-I'm sorry?

593
00:51:48,493 --> 00:51:50,529
I said you're free to go.

594
00:51:51,333 --> 00:51:53,972
Okay. It's just come back to me,
where I was--

595
00:51:54,053 --> 00:51:55,566
Get him out of here.

596
00:52:02,413 --> 00:52:04,722
Nice to see you again. It's been fun.

597
00:52:09,773 --> 00:52:13,049
It's not over yet.
You still have to move the diamond.

598
00:52:14,133 --> 00:52:17,205
And when you do, I'll be there.

599
00:52:31,933 --> 00:52:33,651
-Where have you been?
-Hey.

600
00:52:34,293 --> 00:52:37,410
The nice custody sergeant,
he let me use his phone.

601
00:52:37,493 --> 00:52:38,926
Come on, we haven't got long.

602
00:53:02,093 --> 00:53:03,367
CID.

603
00:53:06,533 --> 00:53:07,682
Are you sure?

604
00:53:09,773 --> 00:53:11,126
Okay, thank you.

605
00:53:12,293 --> 00:53:13,772
Sir.

606
00:53:14,813 --> 00:53:16,610
We've found the diamond.

607
00:53:21,493 --> 00:53:22,812
Yes.

608
00:53:24,853 --> 00:53:27,845
-Where is it?
-It's still at the gallery.

609
00:53:29,893 --> 00:53:31,292
Doris, how did we do?

610
00:53:32,893 --> 00:53:34,531
Five copies as ordered.

611
00:53:38,213 --> 00:53:40,886
That's great, Lily, just one more, please.

612
00:53:41,893 --> 00:53:43,326
I don't understand.

613
00:53:44,933 --> 00:53:46,889
Why go to all this trouble...

614
00:53:48,093 --> 00:53:50,368
and not even take the diamond?

615
00:55:01,493 --> 00:55:05,247
The British government are naturally
very embarrassed by this theft.

616
00:55:05,613 --> 00:55:09,925
So Ml6 has come up with a plan
to invent a story to save face.

617
00:55:10,973 --> 00:55:13,248
They'll say the diamond has been found...

618
00:55:13,333 --> 00:55:15,164
and the perpetrators caught.

619
00:55:15,533 --> 00:55:19,731
They'll then put a replica into the
Royal Scepter and replace it in the Tower.

620
00:55:20,253 --> 00:55:23,211
Yeah, we're expecting
the cover-up story to hit the press...

621
00:55:23,293 --> 00:55:26,012
some time later today, just so you know.

622
00:55:26,853 --> 00:55:31,131
So then, all that leaves me to do
is to ask you, can I use your phone?

623
00:55:31,573 --> 00:55:32,972
Thank you.

624
00:55:38,373 --> 00:55:39,408
Hello, Mom?

625
00:56:04,573 --> 00:56:05,972
Police?

626
00:56:06,533 --> 00:56:11,004
I'd like to report the whereabouts
of some stolen goods.

627
00:56:19,733 --> 00:56:21,883
-You got your amnesty?
-In writing.

628
00:56:22,573 --> 00:56:23,801
And Benny...

629
00:56:25,253 --> 00:56:28,529
-enjoy your retirement.
-I certainly will.

630
00:56:35,933 --> 00:56:37,810
Oh, ye of little faith.

631
00:56:39,253 --> 00:56:40,811
You see, it's the perfect con.

632
00:56:40,893 --> 00:56:43,691
There's no crime,
so there's nothing to be arrested for.

633
00:56:43,773 --> 00:56:47,766
And the only losers are five mugs
greedy enough to buy five fake diamonds.

634
00:56:47,853 --> 00:56:50,048
And when they find out
they've been conned...

635
00:56:51,253 --> 00:56:52,368
who are they gonna tell?

636
00:57:08,853 --> 00:57:11,492
There it is, back of the net.

637
00:57:11,773 --> 00:57:15,004
Right, this is a toast.
A toast to Mickey Bricks...

638
00:57:15,093 --> 00:57:19,132
-who is without doubt, a bleeding genius.
-Worthy of any of the greats.

639
00:57:19,213 --> 00:57:21,363
I still think
he should have told us at the start.

640
00:57:21,453 --> 00:57:24,013
The risk was the same. If you got caught...

641
00:57:24,133 --> 00:57:27,682
who would have believed you weren't
stealing the diamond, simply moving it?

642
00:57:28,133 --> 00:57:29,361
Will you take a look at that?

643
00:57:30,933 --> 00:57:32,685
Nice one, Lily. She deserved a bit of luck.

644
00:57:32,773 --> 00:57:35,367
Yeah, it's beautiful, Ash,
nearly as beautiful as the fact...

645
00:57:35,453 --> 00:57:38,206
that I've now clocked up
93 minutes on my phone line...

646
00:57:38,293 --> 00:57:40,648
which comes to £4,500.

647
00:57:42,213 --> 00:57:43,441
Right on.

648
00:57:44,653 --> 00:57:45,972
-Hey.
-Hey.

649
00:57:47,653 --> 00:57:49,769
-Who paid the bill?
-Danny.

650
00:57:49,933 --> 00:57:52,401
-With what?
-Credit card.

651
00:57:53,413 --> 00:57:56,450
-Please tell me you didn't.
-What?

652
00:57:56,973 --> 00:57:58,406
The police are downstairs...

653
00:57:58,493 --> 00:58:00,961
and the receptionist
is showing them a credit card receipt.

654
00:58:01,053 --> 00:58:03,442
So, please, Danny,
pretty please with knobs on...

655
00:58:03,533 --> 00:58:05,330
tell me you did not use one of yours.

656
00:58:07,813 --> 00:58:10,043
-We better pack.
-Danny.

657
00:58:17,693 --> 00:58:20,207
We've just pulled off
the biggest con of the century...

658
00:58:20,293 --> 00:58:23,763
and we're sneaking out of a hotel
for paying the bill with a bent credit card.

659
00:58:23,853 --> 00:58:25,491
-Yeah, blame me, why don't you?
-We do.

660
00:58:25,573 --> 00:58:27,291
I've had a very rough couple of days,
you know.

661
00:58:27,373 --> 00:58:30,171
All for the good of the team.
I've been pushed in that bloody canal.

662
00:58:30,253 --> 00:58:33,211
Nearly drowned.
I been electrocuted, nearly fried.

663
00:58:33,293 --> 00:58:36,171
I've had a very harrowing time,
I'll have you know.

664
00:58:36,413 --> 00:58:39,086
-Are you lot listening to me?
-No.

665
00:58:48,133 --> 00:58:50,408
-Come on, Albie.
-I'm coming, I'm coming.

666
00:59:42,693 --> 00:59:43,682
English
