<i>Previously on Desperate Housewives:

2
00:00:01,535 --> 00:00:02,700
I left Morty.

3
00:00:02,735 --> 00:00:06,000
<i>Susan's mother made quite an impression.

4
00:00:06,035 --> 00:00:07,900
<i>Bree made a secret commitment.

5
00:00:07,935 --> 00:00:09,300
He's not going to let us be friends.

6
00:00:09,335 --> 00:00:12,000
Who says he has to know
how I spend my free time?

7
00:00:12,035 --> 00:00:13,900
<i>Gabrielle made a discovery.

8
00:00:13,935 --> 00:00:16,700
I am pregnant and it's all your fault!

9
00:00:16,735 --> 00:00:18,600
<i>Tom made a mistake.

10
00:00:18,635 --> 00:00:22,000
You hire your old girlfriend
and you don't tell me about it for 3 months?

11
00:00:22,035 --> 00:00:24,200
<i>And Susan made an appointment...

12
00:00:24,235 --> 00:00:25,300
Do you think you can help me?

13
00:00:25,335 --> 00:00:26,400
<i>...with trouble.

14
00:00:26,435 --> 00:00:30,900
I know I can.

15
00:00:30,935 --> 00:00:35,900
<i>When she was younger,
Sophie Bremer was a hopeless romantic.

16
00:00:36,100 --> 00:00:39,200
<i>She was also hopelessly naïve,

17
00:00:39,235 --> 00:00:43,200
<i>which is how she came to be married 4 times.

18
00:00:43,235 --> 00:00:48,000
<i>The first time,
to a man who liked to gamble.

19
00:00:48,035 --> 00:00:52,100
<i>The second time,
to a man who liked to drink.

20
00:00:52,135 --> 00:00:57,100
<i>The third time,
to a man who liked other men.

21
00:00:57,200 --> 00:00:59,400
<i>And the fourth time,

22
00:00:59,435 --> 00:01:04,400
<i>to the same man she married the second time.

23
00:01:04,800 --> 00:01:09,800
<i>Yes, Sophie was tired of having her heart broken.

24
00:01:09,835 --> 00:01:14,600
<i>So, she decided she would never
get married again.

25
00:01:14,635 --> 00:01:16,900
<i>And then one night,

26
00:01:16,935 --> 00:01:18,300
Sophie!

27
00:01:18,335 --> 00:01:20,500
<i>she had a visitor.

28
00:01:20,535 --> 00:01:23,500
Sophie!

29
00:01:23,535 --> 00:01:25,300
Morty?
What are you doing?

30
00:01:25,335 --> 00:01:28,400
I--I need to talk to Sophie.

31
00:01:28,435 --> 00:01:31,100
Now?
Are you drunk?

32
00:01:31,135 --> 00:01:34,800
Uh-- just a little.

33
00:01:34,835 --> 00:01:39,300
How-- how are you, Susan?

34
00:01:39,335 --> 00:01:43,100
I got to speak to, uh to Sophie.

35
00:01:43,135 --> 00:01:45,700
Are you crazy? It's 1 a.m., she's sleeping!

36
00:01:45,735 --> 00:01:48,500
I'm going to ask her to marry me.

37
00:01:48,535 --> 00:01:49,700
What?

38
00:01:49,735 --> 00:01:51,500
Well, I--I thought I could be happy.

39
00:01:51,535 --> 00:01:54,700
The restaurant is starting to make money,

40
00:01:54,735 --> 00:01:57,600
I just bought a new jet ski,

41
00:01:57,635 --> 00:02:00,500
my cholesterol is down,

42
00:02:00,535 --> 00:02:05,500
but none of it's any fun
without her.

43
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:08,800
Ah, Morty.

44
00:02:08,835 --> 00:02:10,800
I just don't think it's going to happen.

45
00:02:10,835 --> 00:02:12,700
She's moved on.

46
00:02:12,735 --> 00:02:17,600
Why don't you just sit down.
I call you a cab.

47
00:02:17,635 --> 00:02:18,900
Sophie!

48
00:02:18,935 --> 00:02:22,300
Your doctor told you not to drink!

49
00:02:22,335 --> 00:02:27,000
Well, there are times when you need to--

50
00:02:27,035 --> 00:02:32,000
when you need liquid to court.

51
00:02:32,800 --> 00:02:37,800
Oh! Oh!

52
00:02:40,800 --> 00:02:43,000
Did this ring belong to Delores?

53
00:02:43,035 --> 00:02:45,300
You gave her your dead wife's ring?

54
00:02:45,335 --> 00:02:50,300
It's--it's a 3 karat diamond,
she shouldn't care if it's-- used.

55
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:55,800
So what--what do you say, Soph?

56
00:02:55,835 --> 00:02:57,900
All right.
- Really?

57
00:02:57,935 --> 00:03:01,600
Really?
- Yeah!

58
00:03:01,635 --> 00:03:05,800
But you gotta do it officially, you know...

59
00:03:05,835 --> 00:03:10,800
Oh, um--
- Yeah here.

60
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:22,000
Sophie, would you-- do me the honor of-- of marrying me?

61
00:03:22,700 --> 00:03:27,200
<i>Sophie Bremer was still a hopeless romantic.

62
00:03:27,235 --> 00:03:28,800
On one condition:

63
00:03:28,835 --> 00:03:32,400
tomorrow, we trade this in for a ring of my own

64
00:03:32,435 --> 00:03:37,200
and I want a bigger diamond
than Delores got.

65
00:03:37,235 --> 00:03:42,200
<i>But she was no longer naïve.

66
00:03:44,800 --> 00:03:47,800
<i> episode 1-21:
Sunday in the Park with George

67
00:04:25,300 --> 00:04:28,700
<i>Marriage is a simple concept.

68
00:04:28,735 --> 00:04:33,300
<i>Basically, it's a contract between two people

69
00:04:33,335 --> 00:04:36,400
<i>that binds them together for life

70
00:04:36,435 --> 00:04:41,200
<i>in the hopes that they can live happily ever after.

71
00:04:41,235 --> 00:04:44,400
<i>Sadly, some contracts

72
00:04:44,435 --> 00:04:46,400
<i>are made to be broken.

73
00:04:46,435 --> 00:04:48,000
I did not mess with your birth control.

74
00:04:48,035 --> 00:04:53,000
Really?
- Really!

75
00:04:54,400 --> 00:04:58,300
Look! It's been pulled apart and put back together.

76
00:04:58,335 --> 00:05:00,500
It's probably a manufacturing defect.

77
00:05:00,535 --> 00:05:02,900
You can still see the glue marks!

78
00:05:02,935 --> 00:05:04,900
I'm telling you I didn't do it!

79
00:05:04,935 --> 00:05:07,100
Don't insult me, Carlos.

80
00:05:07,135 --> 00:05:09,500
You've been whining about wanting a baby for months.

81
00:05:09,535 --> 00:05:10,900
Who else would it have been?

82
00:05:10,935 --> 00:05:13,500
I-- I don't--

83
00:05:13,535 --> 00:05:15,000
Oh no.

84
00:05:15,035 --> 00:05:16,100
What?

85
00:05:16,135 --> 00:05:16,800
Mamá!

86
00:05:16,835 --> 00:05:18,100
Oh please.

87
00:05:18,135 --> 00:05:20,100
It's possible!

88
00:05:20,135 --> 00:05:23,300
You buy that stuff in bulk 6 months at a time, right?

89
00:05:23,335 --> 00:05:24,100
Yeah, so?

90
00:05:24,135 --> 00:05:27,900
Before the accident, I told her how much I wanted to have a child.

91
00:05:27,935 --> 00:05:30,500
And she said she would take care of it.

92
00:05:30,535 --> 00:05:33,800
I just thought that she would talk to you.

93
00:05:33,835 --> 00:05:38,800
Baby, I am so sorry.

94
00:05:41,900 --> 00:05:46,900
That bitch! I can't believe her!

95
00:05:48,200 --> 00:05:49,300
I loved her.

96
00:05:49,335 --> 00:05:53,200
But even I had issues sometimes. She could be very controlling.

97
00:05:53,235 --> 00:05:57,700
Reaching out from the grave to screw with me.

98
00:05:57,735 --> 00:06:02,100
God, she's good!

99
00:06:02,135 --> 00:06:03,700
Where are you going?

100
00:06:03,735 --> 00:06:06,900
I'm feeling a wave of the morning sickness coming on.

101
00:06:06,935 --> 00:06:11,900
And I want to be standing on your mother's grave when it hits.

102
00:06:17,100 --> 00:06:20,000
Hey honey, I'm going to be home late tonight.

103
00:06:20,035 --> 00:06:22,800
Peterson wants a bunch of us out for drinks.

104
00:06:22,835 --> 00:06:25,800
Oh, that's fine.

105
00:06:25,835 --> 00:06:30,500
I wanted to talk to you about something.
- What?

106
00:06:30,535 --> 00:06:32,900
Oh, you know what? That's your carpool.

107
00:06:32,935 --> 00:06:34,100
You gotta go. Never mind.

108
00:06:34,135 --> 00:06:35,900
Lynette, what is it?

109
00:06:35,935 --> 00:06:39,400
It's nothing.
- OK.

110
00:06:39,435 --> 00:06:44,400
It's just--

111
00:06:44,800 --> 00:06:46,600
We haven't had sex in 10 days,

112
00:06:46,635 --> 00:06:49,700
and the longest we've ever gone before is 9.

113
00:06:49,735 --> 00:06:52,600
Are you sure? Didn't we do it last Thursday?

114
00:06:52,635 --> 00:06:55,600
We started to, but then, wahh--

115
00:06:55,635 --> 00:06:57,000
you fell asleep.

116
00:06:57,035 --> 00:06:58,100
Is this why you're so worried?

117
00:06:58,135 --> 00:07:00,200
Because we could do it tonight if you want to.

118
00:07:00,235 --> 00:07:01,100
Ha ha, where?

119
00:07:01,135 --> 00:07:06,100
No no, I got 10 days pent up in me. We are doing it tonight.

120
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:10,000
Nothing to worry about, OK?

121
00:07:10,035 --> 00:07:13,900
Oh crap, I forgot my briefcase.
Can you tell them I'll be right there?

122
00:07:13,935 --> 00:07:18,900
Yeah, sure.

123
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:23,700
Oh.
- Hey Lynette. So is Tom almost ready?

124
00:07:23,735 --> 00:07:26,700
Yeah, he's just getting his briefcase.

125
00:07:26,735 --> 00:07:31,700
Oh, sorry.
- OK.

126
00:07:39,900 --> 00:07:43,600
Ah, where have you--

127
00:07:43,635 --> 00:07:48,600
Bye.

128
00:07:49,800 --> 00:07:54,700
I got-- I got it! I got it!

129
00:07:54,735 --> 00:07:57,700
Thank you for having me.

130
00:07:57,735 --> 00:07:59,900
I'm going to miss you both so much!

131
00:07:59,935 --> 00:08:03,400
Oh, us too. House will feel empty without you.

132
00:08:03,435 --> 00:08:04,900
Can't you guys stay a little longer?

133
00:08:04,935 --> 00:08:08,400
Oh, no, no. They want to get their new life together started.

134
00:08:08,435 --> 00:08:13,100
We don't want to hold these crazy kids back.

135
00:08:13,135 --> 00:08:16,200
Bye, Morty.
- Bye.

136
00:08:16,235 --> 00:08:19,200
Listen, I-- hope it's OK, but--

137
00:08:19,235 --> 00:08:24,000
your mom told me some of the stuff that you've been going through,

138
00:08:24,035 --> 00:08:28,200
you know, with the-- plumber guy across the street.

139
00:08:28,235 --> 00:08:29,300
She did, huh?

140
00:08:29,335 --> 00:08:32,900
Yeah. Don't give up on him.

141
00:08:32,935 --> 00:08:37,900
If I'd given up, I wouldn't be here now with this lovely lady.

142
00:08:38,300 --> 00:08:42,600
Did she tell you that he served time in prison for manslaughter?

143
00:08:42,635 --> 00:08:46,900
No, she left-- she left that part out.

144
00:08:46,935 --> 00:08:50,000
I don't suppose she told you he was a drug dealer.

145
00:08:50,035 --> 00:08:51,700
I don't recall that.

146
00:08:51,735 --> 00:08:53,400
[You don't] know the whole [story.]

147
00:08:53,435 --> 00:08:56,700
I went over there and I told him how much you love him.

148
00:08:56,735 --> 00:08:58,500
What? What were you thinking?

149
00:08:58,535 --> 00:09:00,000
What did he say?

150
00:09:00,035 --> 00:09:01,200
Yeah, what did he say?

151
00:09:01,235 --> 00:09:05,000
I think I walked in on him in a very bad time.

152
00:09:05,035 --> 00:09:08,200
Someone close to him had just died.

153
00:09:08,235 --> 00:09:10,000
Oh God, really?

154
00:09:10,035 --> 00:09:14,500
He could use a shoulder to cry on.

155
00:09:14,535 --> 00:09:15,800
Did I do wrong?

156
00:09:15,835 --> 00:09:20,800
Please, I can't stand it!

157
00:09:31,200 --> 00:09:33,400
Mm!

158
00:09:33,435 --> 00:09:38,000
Oh George, you have got to taste this.

159
00:09:38,035 --> 00:09:41,100
I can't wait.

160
00:09:41,135 --> 00:09:42,000
Mmmh.

161
00:09:42,035 --> 00:09:44,100
Oh, is that fennel seed? It's fantastic!

162
00:09:44,135 --> 00:09:48,800
I don't know, but anything that good has got to be sinful.

163
00:09:48,835 --> 00:09:52,400
Isn't this fun? Trying different dishes, opening the mind to different experiences.

164
00:09:52,435 --> 00:09:55,000
Rex just hates these cooks tours.

165
00:09:55,035 --> 00:10:00,000
He likes to stay at home with the same old 
plate of spaghetti and a mug of root beer.

166
00:10:05,100 --> 00:10:07,900
So how about this Marinara sauce? 
I think it's the best I've ever had.

167
00:10:07,935 --> 00:10:11,000
I've had one better, but that was in Italy.

168
00:10:11,035 --> 00:10:13,900
You've been to Italy?
- Mhm!

169
00:10:13,935 --> 00:10:16,300
Rex and I took a vacation there.

170
00:10:16,335 --> 00:10:20,700
Right before the kids were born.

171
00:10:20,735 --> 00:10:25,000
It was so much fun in those first few years.

172
00:10:25,035 --> 00:10:30,000
I guess it was just easier to be happy back then.

173
00:10:31,200 --> 00:10:36,200
I don't know why I just said that. 
No more wine for me.

174
00:10:39,700 --> 00:10:42,000
Maybe we should go to Italy.

175
00:10:42,035 --> 00:10:42,800
What?

176
00:10:42,835 --> 00:10:43,700
Wouldn't that be oh?

177
00:10:43,735 --> 00:10:46,800
Going to all those museums and cathedrals, 
it's fantastic for tourists.

178
00:10:46,835 --> 00:10:48,700
We could just pick figs off ourselves.

179
00:10:48,735 --> 00:10:51,800
I can't go on a trip with you, George.

180
00:10:51,835 --> 00:10:53,400
Why not?

181
00:10:53,435 --> 00:10:57,000
I'm married. People would talk.

182
00:10:57,035 --> 00:10:58,700
All right, I'm sorry. It's a bad idea.

183
00:10:58,735 --> 00:11:01,100
Oh, don't worry about it.
Here, I want you to try one of these clams.

184
00:11:01,135 --> 00:11:06,100
I bet they're as good as the Marinara sauce.

185
00:11:13,300 --> 00:11:16,200
Mmmmh.

186
00:11:16,235 --> 00:11:19,000
You are absolutely right.

187
00:11:19,035 --> 00:11:24,000
It's that good, this has got to be sinful.

188
00:11:32,700 --> 00:11:36,500
OK, boys. It's 7 o'clock, it's time for bed.

189
00:11:36,535 --> 00:11:39,800
Sweetie, let's go.
- I don't want to go to bed so early!

190
00:11:39,835 --> 00:11:43,400
I told you, honey, Daddy and I 
have a special meeting tonight.

191
00:11:43,435 --> 00:11:45,000
Go on!

192
00:11:45,035 --> 00:11:50,000
Oh, I love you!

193
00:11:58,400 --> 00:12:01,800
Hi!

194
00:12:01,835 --> 00:12:04,000
Hey.
- Hi.

195
00:12:04,035 --> 00:12:07,100
Whoa. All right, this is the tenth day.

196
00:12:07,135 --> 00:12:11,300
Hey honey, give me a second 
to let the office wear off.

197
00:12:11,335 --> 00:12:16,300
I mean--

198
00:12:22,700 --> 00:12:24,700
What are you thinking?

199
00:12:24,735 --> 00:12:26,800
I was wondering what that smell is.

200
00:12:26,835 --> 00:12:31,800
Oh. It's probably baby drool.

201
00:12:33,400 --> 00:12:35,700
There. Now you got easier access.

202
00:12:35,735 --> 00:12:40,700
I am coming right--

203
00:12:42,300 --> 00:12:43,500
What?

204
00:12:43,535 --> 00:12:46,800
Well, that smell really soaked through, huh?

205
00:12:46,835 --> 00:12:50,700
Yes, it soaked through a little.
That is the nature of baby throw-up.

206
00:12:50,735 --> 00:12:53,200
Do you want me to wear a haz mat suit 
or are you going to be OK?

207
00:12:53,235 --> 00:12:58,200
No, I just like it when you're 
clean and in your sexy clothes.

208
00:12:58,900 --> 00:13:02,800
I don't own anything clean and sexy!

209
00:13:02,835 --> 00:13:07,200
Everything is covered with either 
baby spit or chunks of melted crayon--

210
00:13:07,235 --> 00:13:08,800
OK, I said I'm sorry!

211
00:13:08,835 --> 00:13:11,700
You make me feel like I just 
got off the shrimp boat, for God's sakes!

212
00:13:11,735 --> 00:13:15,100
Honey, I said I'm sorry. 
It's just that, you know--

213
00:13:15,135 --> 00:13:20,100
Guys sometimes like it when women 
put a little effort into things.

214
00:13:23,600 --> 00:13:27,000
OK, um--

215
00:13:27,035 --> 00:13:29,000
Can we just go back to the kissing thing?

216
00:13:29,035 --> 00:13:30,700
Please? Can we try that?

217
00:13:30,735 --> 00:13:35,200
Fine.
- Honey--

218
00:13:35,235 --> 00:13:39,000
OK. Off.

219
00:13:39,035 --> 00:13:44,000
Mo-o-o-m! Mo-o-o-m!

220
00:13:44,300 --> 00:13:46,800
Susan Mayer hired you.

221
00:13:46,835 --> 00:13:49,500
I know.

222
00:13:49,535 --> 00:13:51,400
She decided to start 
poking around in your life

223
00:13:51,435 --> 00:13:54,700
and called me of all people.

224
00:13:54,735 --> 00:13:59,700
Lucky for you, I've got 
the biggest ad in the phone book.

225
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:01,800
What am I going to do?
- Run.

226
00:14:01,835 --> 00:14:03,600
Pack up your kid and get out of town.

227
00:14:03,635 --> 00:14:07,400
That's tricky. My son doesn't want to move.

228
00:14:07,435 --> 00:14:10,600
He can be pretty insistent.

229
00:14:10,635 --> 00:14:15,400
Well, I can throw off the scent for a while.

230
00:14:15,435 --> 00:14:16,800
Fine.

231
00:14:16,835 --> 00:14:19,100
All right then.

232
00:14:19,135 --> 00:14:23,300
Tell me exactly what it is 
you want this woman to believe.

233
00:14:23,335 --> 00:14:26,400
She was born Angela.

234
00:14:26,435 --> 00:14:28,900
But when she was a teenager, 
she changed her name to Mary Alice.

235
00:14:28,935 --> 00:14:33,900
On my application it says that she was 
named after a relative she no longer speaks to.

236
00:14:36,200 --> 00:14:39,900
Here's her birth certificate,

237
00:14:39,935 --> 00:14:44,900
and her Utah petition for legal name change.

238
00:14:45,500 --> 00:14:47,000
What about Dana?

239
00:14:47,035 --> 00:14:50,800
There was a record of another child.

240
00:14:50,835 --> 00:14:52,100
A girl.

241
00:14:52,135 --> 00:14:57,100
Dana Marie Young died at 18 months, 
apparently from some kind of fall.

242
00:14:59,100 --> 00:15:04,100
That was all true. Everything he said.

243
00:15:04,900 --> 00:15:07,400
How could I have been so wrong?

244
00:15:07,435 --> 00:15:10,400
Well, I'm going to need a cheque.

245
00:15:10,435 --> 00:15:15,400
Oh, of course.

246
00:15:21,900 --> 00:15:24,200
Actually, before you go,

247
00:15:24,235 --> 00:15:29,000
I need you to check into 
someone else's background.

248
00:15:29,035 --> 00:15:34,000
There's this plumber I know.

249
00:15:37,600 --> 00:15:39,000
Hey!

250
00:15:39,035 --> 00:15:40,900
Did you get my messages?

251
00:15:40,935 --> 00:15:44,300
Yeah, I didn't want to call you back
because I wanted to talk to you in person.

252
00:15:44,335 --> 00:15:48,400
I have some potentially upsetting news.

253
00:15:48,435 --> 00:15:51,400
Come on, Mrs Solís, you can tell me.

254
00:15:51,435 --> 00:15:53,600
I can handle it.

255
00:15:53,635 --> 00:15:58,600
I'm pregnant and it might be yours.

256
00:16:06,800 --> 00:16:10,400
I could barely afford my new dirt bike.
How am I going to handle child support?

257
00:16:10,435 --> 00:16:13,600
We don't even know for sure if it's yours, so relax.

258
00:16:13,635 --> 00:16:15,600
And I didn't come here to watch you freak out.

259
00:16:15,635 --> 00:16:16,600
Then why did you come here?

260
00:16:16,635 --> 00:16:19,400
Cause I want to make sure you let me protect you.
- From who?

261
00:16:19,435 --> 00:16:22,400
Carlos. Your parents.

262
00:16:22,435 --> 00:16:25,700
John, something like this can ruin your life.

263
00:16:25,735 --> 00:16:28,600
That's why you have to keep quiet about our affair.

264
00:16:28,635 --> 00:16:33,600
There's no point in 
this catastrophe taking both of us down.

265
00:16:35,200 --> 00:16:36,600
Thank you.

266
00:16:36,635 --> 00:16:40,800
Forget about it.

267
00:16:40,835 --> 00:16:43,000
I should've worn a condom.

268
00:16:43,035 --> 00:16:47,900
Yeah, that would've been helpful.

269
00:16:47,935 --> 00:16:50,000
You hired a private investigator?

270
00:16:50,035 --> 00:16:53,000
I can't trust Mike, and I want to 
find out what really happened.

271
00:16:53,035 --> 00:16:56,600
From a source that doesn't have an agenda.

272
00:16:56,635 --> 00:16:58,800
Now open it up.

273
00:16:58,835 --> 00:17:02,900
OK. Ready?

274
00:17:02,935 --> 00:17:04,700
Go.

275
00:17:04,735 --> 00:17:06,000
Stop!
- What?

276
00:17:06,035 --> 00:17:07,500
Um--

277
00:17:07,535 --> 00:17:12,100
If you find out something that's really bad,

278
00:17:12,135 --> 00:17:17,100
just try to put a positive spin on it.

279
00:17:22,800 --> 00:17:25,400
OK.

280
00:17:25,435 --> 00:17:29,300
I have some good news and some bad news.

281
00:17:29,335 --> 00:17:31,600
Give me the bad news first.

282
00:17:31,635 --> 00:17:34,400
The guy Mike killed

283
00:17:34,435 --> 00:17:39,400
was a cop.
- Oh my God!

284
00:17:41,800 --> 00:17:44,500
OK. Give me the good news.

285
00:17:44,535 --> 00:17:47,000
There is none.
- What?

286
00:17:47,035 --> 00:17:49,100
You told me to spin it. 
I did the best I could.

287
00:17:49,135 --> 00:17:54,100
Forget it. 
Just let me look at it myself.

288
00:18:06,400 --> 00:18:07,900
Can't believe it.

289
00:18:07,935 --> 00:18:10,000
What is it?

290
00:18:10,035 --> 00:18:15,000
I know her.

291
00:18:32,900 --> 00:18:37,900
What's going on here?

292
00:18:38,800 --> 00:18:41,200
You two just won't stop, will you?

293
00:18:41,235 --> 00:18:42,900
Deirdre's dead.

294
00:18:42,935 --> 00:18:46,100
It doesn't matter who killed her. 
Just let it go.

295
00:18:46,135 --> 00:18:47,700
It's not that easy, "Keirdre".

296
00:18:47,735 --> 00:18:50,000
Why? My sister hated you.

297
00:18:50,035 --> 00:18:52,300
Both of you. She said so.

298
00:18:52,335 --> 00:18:54,300
That was her drugs talking.

299
00:18:54,335 --> 00:18:56,900
Right. The drugs.

300
00:18:56,935 --> 00:19:00,900
Deirdre humiliated this family, 
and she threw our love back in our faces.

301
00:19:00,935 --> 00:19:02,900
She knew it, and she couldn't have cared less.

302
00:19:02,935 --> 00:19:05,300
Are you done?
- No.

303
00:19:05,335 --> 00:19:09,100
I want to know what you're planning.

304
00:19:09,135 --> 00:19:11,300
We're just talking.

305
00:19:11,335 --> 00:19:13,300
I don't believe you.

306
00:19:13,335 --> 00:19:18,300
Then don't ask.

307
00:19:24,100 --> 00:19:28,100
Of course I don't want a new cardiologist,
but Lee's been conducting tests for weeks.

308
00:19:28,135 --> 00:19:30,600
He should've been able to figure out 
what's wrong with me by now.

309
00:19:30,635 --> 00:19:32,600
Honey, we socialize with them.

310
00:19:32,635 --> 00:19:33,800
What am I going to say to Helen?

311
00:19:33,835 --> 00:19:38,800
All I know is, I've never felt worse. 
I got to do something.

312
00:19:39,900 --> 00:19:44,900
Um, I-- I have to talk to Edie.

313
00:19:44,935 --> 00:19:46,200
Bree! We're going to be late!

314
00:19:46,235 --> 00:19:49,000
Oh, it'll just take a second, 
I need to, um, get--

315
00:19:49,035 --> 00:19:50,100
a recipe!

316
00:19:50,135 --> 00:19:51,400
Edie!

317
00:19:51,435 --> 00:19:52,900
Hi!
- Hi.

318
00:19:52,935 --> 00:19:56,900
I saw you at Fredo's yesterday.
- Yeah, I saw you too.

319
00:19:56,935 --> 00:19:59,700
Ts, ts. Naughty, naughty!
- I beg your pardon?

320
00:19:59,735 --> 00:20:04,100
The guy. The one you were spoonfeeding.

321
00:20:04,135 --> 00:20:07,400
Not bad. A little petite for my taste, 
but then again,

322
00:20:07,435 --> 00:20:09,000
I'm not the one sleeping with him.

323
00:20:09,035 --> 00:20:11,100
This is exactly what I was afraid of.

324
00:20:11,135 --> 00:20:13,700
George and I are just friends.

325
00:20:13,735 --> 00:20:16,100
Hey, I'm not judging you. I get it.

326
00:20:16,135 --> 00:20:20,100
I mean, Rex was sticking it into 
that hooker housewife. It's payback time.

327
00:20:20,135 --> 00:20:23,500
you have got the wrong idea. That man is my pharmacist.

328
00:20:23,535 --> 00:20:26,900
You could have an affair with anyone, and you choose a pharmacist?

329
00:20:26,935 --> 00:20:28,400
You are such a Republican!

330
00:20:28,435 --> 00:20:31,500
I am not having an affair!

331
00:20:31,535 --> 00:20:34,500
George and I, we just talk.

332
00:20:34,535 --> 00:20:38,800
He's a very good listener, 
and I share my hopes and dreams with him,

333
00:20:38,835 --> 00:20:42,800
and my innermost thoughts, 
and that's all there is to it.

334
00:20:42,835 --> 00:20:44,000
You have to believe me.

335
00:20:44,035 --> 00:20:45,900
OK, I believe you.

336
00:20:45,935 --> 00:20:48,700
Thank you. I'm glad we cleared this up.

337
00:20:48,735 --> 00:20:50,100
I know it must have looked strange,

338
00:20:50,135 --> 00:20:54,700
and I didn't want you to think 
that I was cheating on my husband.

339
00:20:54,735 --> 00:20:57,500
But you sort of are.

340
00:20:57,535 --> 00:21:00,200
Excuse me?
- Come on, Bree.

341
00:21:00,235 --> 00:21:03,000
You're telling this guy your innermost thoughts?

342
00:21:03,035 --> 00:21:05,400
Your hopes, your dreams?

343
00:21:05,435 --> 00:21:10,100
Sex aside, it sounds like you're 
pretty intimate with a guy that's not your husband.

344
00:21:10,135 --> 00:21:15,100
Oh, I mean, everybody needs someone to talk to.

345
00:21:17,300 --> 00:21:22,300
What's wrong with talking to Rex?

346
00:21:25,700 --> 00:21:29,300
We're not home, please leave a message.
- Hello Zach!

347
00:21:29,335 --> 00:21:31,700
It's Felicia Tilman.

348
00:21:31,735 --> 00:21:36,700
I do so enjoy our little visits, 
and I haven't seen you for a few days.

349
00:21:37,500 --> 00:21:40,900
I hope everything's all right.

350
00:21:40,935 --> 00:21:42,400
Zach's not feeling well.

351
00:21:42,435 --> 00:21:44,800
Oh. Paul.

352
00:21:44,835 --> 00:21:49,800
And I don't think it's appropriate 
if he spends so much time at your house.

353
00:21:54,500 --> 00:21:58,800
I made you some cocoa. 
How are you feeling?

354
00:21:58,835 --> 00:22:03,300
I've felt awful for two days now.

355
00:22:03,335 --> 00:22:05,500
I think I should see a doctor.

356
00:22:05,535 --> 00:22:10,500
It's probably just a touch of the flu.
We'll keep an eye on it.

357
00:22:12,100 --> 00:22:15,700
It's this house, Zach.
I feel it too.

358
00:22:15,735 --> 00:22:18,100
It isn't healthy for us to stay here.

359
00:22:18,135 --> 00:22:21,300
I told you. I'm not moving.

360
00:22:21,335 --> 00:22:23,700
It would be for your own good.

361
00:22:23,735 --> 00:22:27,000
You can't keep running around, 
doing the kinds of things you're doing.

362
00:22:27,035 --> 00:22:29,600
Susan Mayer's kitchen, for example.

363
00:22:29,635 --> 00:22:32,800
People are going to catch on.

364
00:22:32,835 --> 00:22:33,900
Yes...

365
00:22:33,935 --> 00:22:37,700
Wouldn't it be great to just 
start over somewhere in the country?

366
00:22:37,735 --> 00:22:39,300
You could meet some new friends.

367
00:22:39,335 --> 00:22:42,800
Maybe even meet a new girl.

368
00:22:42,835 --> 00:22:47,800
How about I let you sleep on that?

369
00:22:47,835 --> 00:22:51,600
We'll talk about moving tomorrow.

370
00:22:51,635 --> 00:22:56,600
<i>The lack of passion in her marriage
had become an unpleasant reality for Lynette.

371
00:22:58,600 --> 00:23:03,600
<i>Then one day, it occurred to her
the best way to fight reality

372
00:23:06,000 --> 00:23:11,000
<i>was with a little fantasy.

373
00:23:11,200 --> 00:23:16,200
<i>Of course, all the fantasy in the world 
won't do you any good

374
00:23:17,700 --> 00:23:22,700
<i>if no one shows up to enjoy it.

375
00:23:41,000 --> 00:23:43,700
I really feel bad about 
putting you out like this time.

376
00:23:43,735 --> 00:23:46,800
You're not putting anybody out.
You've been flying all day.

377
00:23:46,835 --> 00:23:49,100
Why stay in some hotel?

378
00:23:49,135 --> 00:23:54,100
I just hope you don't mind 
sleeping on the sofa.

379
00:23:54,200 --> 00:23:59,200
Yeah. The sofa should be fine.

380
00:24:06,700 --> 00:24:09,700
Hey honey. 
Why don't you just let the maid get that?

381
00:24:09,735 --> 00:24:12,400
Ha ha ha, not funny, Tom.

382
00:24:12,435 --> 00:24:13,500
By the way, Gary's showering.

383
00:24:13,535 --> 00:24:16,200
He asked if you could bring him a clean towel and--

384
00:24:16,235 --> 00:24:19,400
and your riding crap.

385
00:24:19,435 --> 00:24:20,700
Come on!

386
00:24:20,735 --> 00:24:23,900
No, I'm glad that you 
find my humiliation so entertaining.

387
00:24:23,935 --> 00:24:27,600
Honey, you were wearing a French maid's costume!

388
00:24:27,635 --> 00:24:30,700
I mean, come on, what were you thinking?

389
00:24:30,735 --> 00:24:32,100
I was thinking our marriage was in trouble

390
00:24:32,135 --> 00:24:37,100
and one of us ought to do something 
to try and save it.

391
00:24:37,300 --> 00:24:41,300
Wow, since when is our marriage in trouble?

392
00:24:41,335 --> 00:24:46,000
OK, so we haven't had sex for a few days.
Big deal. It happens.

393
00:24:46,035 --> 00:24:50,900
Oh. That's Annabelle. How ironic!

394
00:24:50,935 --> 00:24:53,700
How is Annabelle roll into this conversation?

395
00:24:53,735 --> 00:24:57,900
Because she now comes to this house 
every morning to remind you what I'm not.

396
00:24:57,935 --> 00:24:58,900
What?

397
00:24:58,935 --> 00:25:00,800
She's the fantasy, Tom.

398
00:25:00,835 --> 00:25:05,800
The hot woman you work with every day, 
with her manicured nails and her designer outfits.

399
00:25:06,600 --> 00:25:08,300
I--

400
00:25:08,335 --> 00:25:10,200
am the reality.

401
00:25:10,235 --> 00:25:13,100
The wife who never wears makeup and whose clothes

402
00:25:13,135 --> 00:25:16,300
smell like a hamper.

403
00:25:16,335 --> 00:25:19,200
This may have been 
the stupidest thing you've ever said.

404
00:25:19,235 --> 00:25:21,300
I used to be the fantasy.

405
00:25:21,335 --> 00:25:25,300
There was a time
when I didn't need a maid's outfit,

406
00:25:25,335 --> 00:25:30,300
because I knew I was enough for you,
even wearing a smelly T-shirt.

407
00:25:31,000 --> 00:25:36,000
And clearly, that's no longer the case.

408
00:25:37,300 --> 00:25:40,400
OK honey, I don't know what to say.

409
00:25:40,435 --> 00:25:42,600
If there's a way for me to fix this,
I will do it.

410
00:25:42,635 --> 00:25:44,600
Just tell me, and I will do it.

411
00:25:44,635 --> 00:25:47,000
No, there's nothing to fix.

412
00:25:47,035 --> 00:25:52,000
We've changed. That's all I'm saying.

413
00:25:54,800 --> 00:25:59,100
You ready?

414
00:25:59,135 --> 00:26:04,100
You should go. 
You don't want to keep Annabelle waiting.

415
00:26:12,000 --> 00:26:14,800
Be careful with that. 
It'll get the baby heartburn.

416
00:26:14,835 --> 00:26:18,600
Can't get it hot enough. 
My hormones are killing my taste buds.

417
00:26:18,635 --> 00:26:22,400
I'm paying more attention to your food 
than you have to me lately.

418
00:26:22,435 --> 00:26:27,400
I plan on getting really fat, 
as a tribute to your mother.

419
00:26:41,500 --> 00:26:43,100
John! What are you doing here?

420
00:26:43,135 --> 00:26:45,900
I've been doing some serious thinking 
about the baby.

421
00:26:45,935 --> 00:26:47,400
Really? Why?

422
00:26:47,435 --> 00:26:49,100
Look, there's a good chance that it's mine.

423
00:26:49,135 --> 00:26:50,800
And if it is, I want to do the right thing.

424
00:26:50,835 --> 00:26:54,900
No, no! Nobody expects you to do the right thing!

425
00:26:54,935 --> 00:26:56,500
I kind of figured you'd try to blow me off.

426
00:26:56,535 --> 00:26:59,100
That's why I'm going directly, Mrs Solís.

427
00:26:59,135 --> 00:27:01,500
What? Are you crazy? He would kill us both.

428
00:27:01,535 --> 00:27:04,000
He and I need to hash this out. Man to man.

429
00:27:04,035 --> 00:27:06,300
That's what's best for the baby.

430
00:27:06,335 --> 00:27:07,900
John!

431
00:27:07,935 --> 00:27:12,900
Are you going to go get him or am I?

432
00:27:13,200 --> 00:27:18,200
OK. You win.

433
00:27:18,235 --> 00:27:23,200
Wait right here.

434
00:27:34,400 --> 00:27:35,800
Uh- Don't get out!

435
00:27:35,835 --> 00:27:38,500
Why?

436
00:27:38,535 --> 00:27:42,500
Because I was going to get in.

437
00:27:42,535 --> 00:27:47,300
Yeah. You see, 
pregnant women have very strong urges.

438
00:27:47,335 --> 00:27:50,200
All right.

439
00:27:50,235 --> 00:27:53,700
OK, I'm going to freshen up, 
and I'll be right back.

440
00:27:53,735 --> 00:27:54,700
OK.

441
00:27:54,735 --> 00:27:57,900
You sit! Sit!

442
00:27:57,935 --> 00:28:02,900
I'm turning on some music.

443
00:28:09,700 --> 00:28:14,700
Um-- Carlos is unavailable at the moment.

444
00:28:14,735 --> 00:28:16,000
You're lying.

445
00:28:16,035 --> 00:28:17,100
John, what're you doing?

446
00:28:17,135 --> 00:28:18,800
Mr Solís!
- Stop it!

447
00:28:18,835 --> 00:28:23,500
Mr Solís, open up!

448
00:28:23,535 --> 00:28:26,200
John! What are you doing?
John! John!

449
00:28:26,235 --> 00:28:27,900
Please, get out of the way.

450
00:28:27,935 --> 00:28:32,800
John!
- Get out of the way!

451
00:28:32,835 --> 00:28:37,000
Oh my God!

452
00:28:37,035 --> 00:28:38,500
My God, it burns!

453
00:28:38,535 --> 00:28:40,100
I'm sorry, it's just salsa!

454
00:28:40,135 --> 00:28:41,300
Feels like acid.

455
00:28:41,335 --> 00:28:43,200
Really? I've been finding it so bland.

456
00:28:43,235 --> 00:28:44,800
Mr Solís! Mr Solís!
- John!

457
00:28:44,835 --> 00:28:48,900
Mr Solís, come out here, I need to talk to you!

458
00:28:48,935 --> 00:28:50,500
Shut the hell up! Listen to me.

459
00:28:50,535 --> 00:28:53,500
You are never going to be the father of this baby!

460
00:28:53,535 --> 00:28:57,500
No matter what the paternity tests say,
it's Carlos's child.

461
00:28:57,535 --> 00:28:58,700
How can you say that?

462
00:28:58,735 --> 00:29:03,700
Because Carlos can provide, John.
He will give this baby everything.

463
00:29:03,735 --> 00:29:08,600
Piano lessons, and summer camp, 
and the best colleges...

464
00:29:08,635 --> 00:29:12,600
He can raise this child the way a child 
deserves to be raised. You can't.

465
00:29:12,635 --> 00:29:16,200
This isn't about money. 
This is about what's best for the baby.

466
00:29:16,235 --> 00:29:19,500
If you want what's best for the baby, 
I think you will help me.

467
00:29:19,535 --> 00:29:24,300
Hey, help me make sure that this kid 
does not grow up poor like I did.

468
00:29:24,335 --> 00:29:27,500
What's taking you?

469
00:29:27,535 --> 00:29:30,000
Hey John.

470
00:29:30,035 --> 00:29:34,000
What are you doing here?

471
00:29:34,035 --> 00:29:35,500
Uh-- he--

472
00:29:35,535 --> 00:29:38,200
Justin was thinking 
the hydrangeas need a replacement.

473
00:29:38,235 --> 00:29:41,200
He wanted me to come by for a second opinion.

474
00:29:41,235 --> 00:29:42,900
Your friend is a good kid.

475
00:29:42,935 --> 00:29:45,000
But he's not half the gardener you are.

476
00:29:45,035 --> 00:29:46,800
You should come back and work for us.

477
00:29:46,835 --> 00:29:51,500
I mean, we're practically family.

478
00:29:51,535 --> 00:29:56,500
Thanks, Mr Solís.

479
00:30:18,600 --> 00:30:23,600
Zach? Are you here?

480
00:30:50,600 --> 00:30:52,100
I have to do this, dear.

481
00:30:52,135 --> 00:30:57,100
I know you'll forgive me.

482
00:31:11,100 --> 00:31:12,800
Hey.
- Hey.

483
00:31:12,835 --> 00:31:14,600
Are the boys asleep?

484
00:31:14,635 --> 00:31:15,300
Tucked in tight.

485
00:31:15,335 --> 00:31:16,800
Get a penny?

486
00:31:16,835 --> 00:31:18,700
Sound asleep.

487
00:31:18,735 --> 00:31:20,600
Good.

488
00:31:20,635 --> 00:31:23,000
OK, when this thing goes off,

489
00:31:23,035 --> 00:31:25,500
meet me in the bedroom.

490
00:31:25,535 --> 00:31:27,000
What are you-- what is this?

491
00:31:27,035 --> 00:31:32,000
Wait till it goes off.

492
00:31:36,000 --> 00:31:37,500
All right!

493
00:31:37,535 --> 00:31:42,500
I'm coming in!

494
00:31:47,000 --> 00:31:50,300
Oh my God!

495
00:31:50,335 --> 00:31:55,000
You want fantasy? 
I'll give you fantasy.

496
00:31:55,035 --> 00:31:57,700
Come to me, woman. 
Prepare to be bored to death.

497
00:31:57,735 --> 00:32:02,700
Please, will we make it past this stage? 
I'm scathing.

498
00:32:03,000 --> 00:32:05,600
I kind of like it.

499
00:32:05,635 --> 00:32:10,200
Good, get out the lights.

500
00:32:10,235 --> 00:32:11,700
No.

501
00:32:11,735 --> 00:32:12,200
Please.

502
00:32:12,235 --> 00:32:14,200
I'm not turning off the lights.
- Please.

503
00:32:14,235 --> 00:32:19,200
No, no, no.

504
00:32:24,700 --> 00:32:27,000
It's open.

505
00:32:27,035 --> 00:32:30,000
Oh, Paul, it's you.
I'm so glad.

506
00:32:30,035 --> 00:32:32,100
I have some papers I want you to look at.

507
00:32:32,135 --> 00:32:33,400
Where's my son?

508
00:32:33,435 --> 00:32:37,700
Upstairs, sleeping off 
those tranquilizers you gave him.

509
00:32:37,735 --> 00:32:40,300
I don't know what you think you're doing, 
but I'm taking my son and going.

510
00:32:40,335 --> 00:32:45,300
I am not my sister, Paul. 
You do not want to screw with me.

511
00:32:47,800 --> 00:32:51,000
Martha kept a journal.

512
00:32:51,035 --> 00:32:56,000
Every drab event of her drab life, 
meticulously documented.

513
00:32:57,800 --> 00:33:01,600
Including her discovery 
that you and your wife

514
00:33:01,635 --> 00:33:05,500
stole a baby.

515
00:33:05,535 --> 00:33:10,500
A baby named Dana.

516
00:33:14,500 --> 00:33:16,900
I'm sorry if the copies are hard to read.

517
00:33:16,935 --> 00:33:19,300
I hid the originals in a safe place.

518
00:33:19,335 --> 00:33:24,300
It seemed like a reasonable precaution,
since you murdered Martha and all.

519
00:33:25,300 --> 00:33:30,300
Would you like a cookie?

520
00:33:31,300 --> 00:33:34,200
Suit yourself.

521
00:33:34,235 --> 00:33:36,500
Now, I have a little proposition for you.

522
00:33:36,535 --> 00:33:40,900
These are the fantasies of a bored, 
lonely woman. They prove nothing.

523
00:33:40,935 --> 00:33:43,600
The only reason the police haven't caught you yet

524
00:33:43,635 --> 00:33:48,600
is because they have no reason to suspect you.

525
00:33:48,635 --> 00:33:53,600
But once they find out that Martha was 
blackmailing Angela --sorry, Mary Alice--

526
00:33:55,200 --> 00:33:57,200
What it is you want?

527
00:33:57,235 --> 00:33:59,600
The same thing you want.

528
00:33:59,635 --> 00:34:02,700
For you to leave town, 
change your name

529
00:34:02,735 --> 00:34:07,700
and start your life over again
somewhere far away from here.

530
00:34:08,800 --> 00:34:11,900
If you're so sure of yourself, 
why don't you just turn me in?

531
00:34:11,935 --> 00:34:14,800
Because Zach would never forgive me.

532
00:34:14,835 --> 00:34:18,200
And it's important that we be on good terms,

533
00:34:18,235 --> 00:34:23,000
seeing as how he's going to 
be living with me now.

534
00:34:23,035 --> 00:34:24,400
What?

535
00:34:24,435 --> 00:34:26,600
You're bad as a parent.

536
00:34:26,635 --> 00:34:30,900
You're about to become a fugitive.
Is that the kind of life you want for your son?

537
00:34:30,935 --> 00:34:35,900
The two of you spending 
every night in a different town?

538
00:34:36,200 --> 00:34:41,200
No. You're a better father than that.

539
00:34:41,400 --> 00:34:46,400
I can't just leave him.

540
00:34:50,500 --> 00:34:54,100
You stole him so that he 
could have a better life.

541
00:34:54,135 --> 00:34:59,000
That was a noble act, Paul. Truly.

542
00:34:59,035 --> 00:35:04,000
And it's time for you to be noble again.

543
00:35:06,000 --> 00:35:09,600
Can I at least say goodbye?

544
00:35:09,635 --> 00:35:14,600
Did you allow me to say goodbye to Martha?

545
00:35:42,300 --> 00:35:45,700
Oh, hi. 
I'm looking for Kendra Taylor.

546
00:35:45,735 --> 00:35:48,000
I'm sorry, 
you're going to have to leave.

547
00:35:48,035 --> 00:35:53,000
Oh. You don't understand.
See, I can't just drive away.

548
00:35:53,500 --> 00:35:55,000
Please, back in the car!

549
00:35:55,035 --> 00:35:58,400
Look, um-- Bob.
Let me try to explain.

550
00:35:58,435 --> 00:35:59,500
In the car!

551
00:35:59,535 --> 00:36:04,500
See, this is maybe my last chance to 
find out if I can be with the man I love.

552
00:36:05,100 --> 00:36:06,500
Ma'am--
- And Bob,

553
00:36:06,535 --> 00:36:09,500
I can't begin to tell you 
how much that means to me!

554
00:36:09,535 --> 00:36:14,500
So I'm going to walk up to that house, 
and you're going to let me.

555
00:36:14,535 --> 00:36:16,600
And you know why?

556
00:36:16,635 --> 00:36:21,600
Because behind that badge and that big 
you-could-crush-me-like-a-fly chest,

557
00:36:23,600 --> 00:36:25,900
there's the heart.

558
00:36:25,935 --> 00:36:30,900
A heart that believes in love.

559
00:36:33,800 --> 00:36:35,900
Just get in the damn car!

560
00:36:35,935 --> 00:36:40,000
It's not my fault
you don't have love in your life!

561
00:36:40,035 --> 00:36:42,200
Susan?

562
00:36:42,235 --> 00:36:44,800
Hi, Kendra.

563
00:36:44,835 --> 00:36:48,300
And despite the evidence, despite all 
that's been laid out in front of me,

564
00:36:48,335 --> 00:36:51,000
I just can't help thinking 
there's more to the story.

565
00:36:51,035 --> 00:36:52,500
Does that sound stupid?

566
00:36:52,535 --> 00:36:54,800
No, no. Of course not.

567
00:36:54,835 --> 00:36:59,100
Unfortunately, 
you've got the whole story right here.

568
00:36:59,135 --> 00:37:02,200
Look, Mike's lawyer will probably get self-defense,
and if that's the case--

569
00:37:02,235 --> 00:37:05,700
Delfino sold black tar heroin to my daughter.

570
00:37:05,735 --> 00:37:09,600
He killed the cop who tried to bust him,
got convicted and did his time.

571
00:37:09,635 --> 00:37:11,700
End of story.
- Dad--

572
00:37:11,735 --> 00:37:16,700
She deserves to hear the truth, however awful.

573
00:37:16,800 --> 00:37:21,800
I'm sorry, Ms. Mayer. I really am.

574
00:37:23,200 --> 00:37:28,200
I appreciate you talking to me.

575
00:37:30,900 --> 00:37:33,400
What the hell was that?

576
00:37:33,435 --> 00:37:38,100
If she knew the truth,
she'd go running back to him.

577
00:37:38,135 --> 00:37:41,800
She might talk him out of doing this job.

578
00:37:41,835 --> 00:37:46,800
I can't risk that.
Just don't have the time.

579
00:38:01,200 --> 00:38:03,400
Quick. Drive around the corner.

580
00:38:03,435 --> 00:38:06,900
We need to talk.

581
00:38:06,935 --> 00:38:07,700
What do you think, Rex?

582
00:38:07,735 --> 00:38:12,500
I'll choose greens. That'll work
whether Gabrielle has a boy or a girl.

583
00:38:12,535 --> 00:38:15,600
That's great.

584
00:38:15,635 --> 00:38:18,500
What's the matter?
You've been mopey all day.

585
00:38:18,535 --> 00:38:22,800
I'm sorry. I'm just worried about the test results.

586
00:38:22,835 --> 00:38:25,600
If they don't find out what's wrong with me soon, 
I'll lose my mind.

587
00:38:25,635 --> 00:38:27,400
Oh honey.

588
00:38:27,435 --> 00:38:30,400
You must get tired of hearing me complain.
- No.

589
00:38:30,435 --> 00:38:31,400
No, not at all.

590
00:38:31,435 --> 00:38:34,000
I think that we should talk about it.

591
00:38:34,035 --> 00:38:38,600
In fact, I think maybe we don't talk enough.

592
00:38:38,635 --> 00:38:41,900
Yeah, I guess.

593
00:38:41,935 --> 00:38:46,100
Why don't we start doing things 
together again as a couple?

594
00:38:46,135 --> 00:38:50,200
Mhm.

595
00:38:50,235 --> 00:38:54,400
I think that as soon as you're well enough,
we should go on a vacation.

596
00:38:54,435 --> 00:38:58,800
Take a trip, go somewhere fun.

597
00:38:58,835 --> 00:39:00,800
Remember our trip to Italy?

598
00:39:00,835 --> 00:39:05,300
Yeah, sort of.
- Sort of?

599
00:39:05,335 --> 00:39:09,500
You don't remember the glorious food
and the gorgeous scenery and--

600
00:39:09,535 --> 00:39:11,500
What I remember is sweating like a pig

601
00:39:11,535 --> 00:39:16,500
and wishing we hadn't spent all our savings.

602
00:39:17,500 --> 00:39:22,500
So where would you like to go?

603
00:39:27,500 --> 00:39:32,500
It doesn't matter. You decide.

604
00:39:37,800 --> 00:39:42,300
Michael wasn't a drug dealer.
- What?

605
00:39:42,335 --> 00:39:44,200
Deirdre was.

606
00:39:44,235 --> 00:39:47,400
Mike-- he kicked the habit earlier on.

607
00:39:47,435 --> 00:39:51,900
But Deirdre couldn't -- 
or didn't want to, I don't know.

608
00:39:51,935 --> 00:39:56,100
Anyway, she spiralled out of control
and was in and out of jail.

609
00:39:56,135 --> 00:39:59,600
One day,
an undercover cop caught her using.

610
00:39:59,635 --> 00:40:04,500
And he forced her
to trade sex for freedom.

611
00:40:04,535 --> 00:40:09,500
Mike found out about it,
and he tried to put a stop to it.

612
00:40:09,900 --> 00:40:14,900
He busted in on the two of them. He--

613
00:40:14,935 --> 00:40:18,500
The cop pulled a gun on him,
and Mike fought him off.

614
00:40:18,535 --> 00:40:22,000
But they both went over a balcony.

615
00:40:22,035 --> 00:40:27,000
Mike was the only one that got back up.

616
00:40:29,700 --> 00:40:33,600
It was self-defense.

617
00:40:33,635 --> 00:40:37,500
Yeah.

618
00:40:37,535 --> 00:40:41,800
Mike went to jail,
trying to save my sister.

619
00:40:41,835 --> 00:40:46,800
But he couldn't.

620
00:40:49,000 --> 00:40:52,700
I knew he was good.

621
00:40:52,735 --> 00:40:57,700
I just knew it.

622
00:40:58,700 --> 00:41:03,700
Thank you.

623
00:41:06,600 --> 00:41:11,500
<i>The vow is simple, really.

624
00:41:11,535 --> 00:41:16,500
<i>Those who take it promise
"to stay together, for better or for worse,

625
00:41:17,900 --> 00:41:21,900
<I>"for richer or for poorer,

626
00:41:21,935 --> 00:41:26,900
<I>"in sickness and in health,

627
00:41:27,500 --> 00:41:32,500

<I>"until death do us part."

630
00:41:52,600 --> 00:41:56,700
<i>Yes, the vow is simple.

631
00:41:56,735 --> 00:42:01,700
<i>Finding someone worthy of such a promise
is the hard part.

632
00:42:02,200 --> 00:42:04,800
<i>But if we can,

633
00:42:04,835 --> 00:42:09,800
<i>that's when we begin
to live happily ever after.
