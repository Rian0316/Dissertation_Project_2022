1
00:00:02,700 --> 00:00:05,139
- 'Who are you?
- Jim Moriarty.

2
00:00:05,140 --> 00:00:06,220
'Bye!

3
00:00:07,700 --> 00:00:09,580
'Consulting criminal.

4
00:00:12,020 --> 00:00:14,900
'I have loved this,
this little game of ours.

5
00:00:15,900 --> 00:00:18,660
- 'People have died.
- That's what people DO!'

6
00:00:23,020 --> 00:00:24,100
' I will stop you.'

7
00:00:25,500 --> 00:00:27,340
If you don't stop prying...

8
00:00:29,100 --> 00:00:30,260
I'll burn you.

9
00:00:31,540 --> 00:00:35,260
I will burn the heart out of you.

10
00:00:36,620 --> 00:00:39,280
Catch you later.

11
00:00:41,780 --> 00:00:43,820
No, you won't!

12
00:00:48,220 --> 00:00:49,579
Sorry, boys!

13
00:00:49,580 --> 00:00:51,339
I'm SO changeable!

14
00:00:52,340 --> 00:00:53,780
It is a weakness with me,

15
00:00:53,781 --> 00:00:57,139
but to be fair to myself,
it is my only weakness.

16
00:00:57,140 --> 00:00:59,020
You can't be allowed to continue.

17
00:01:01,020 --> 00:01:02,459
You just can't.

18
00:01:02,460 --> 00:01:04,059
I would try to convince you,

19
00:01:04,060 --> 00:01:08,740
but everything I have to say
has already crossed your mind.

20
00:01:13,500 --> 00:01:16,420
Probably my answer
has crossed yours.

21
00:01:51,940 --> 00:01:54,619
Do you mind if I get that?

22
00:01:54,620 --> 00:01:56,299
No, please.

23
00:01:56,300 --> 00:01:58,740
You've got the rest of your life.

24
00:02:01,540 --> 00:02:02,620
Hello?

25
00:02:04,540 --> 00:02:06,340
Yes, of course it is.
What do you want?

26
00:02:11,660 --> 00:02:12,780
SAY THAT AGAIN!

27
00:02:14,580 --> 00:02:18,379
Say that again, and know that
if you're lying to me,

28
00:02:18,380 --> 00:02:22,160
I will find you,
and I will skin you.

29
00:02:26,340 --> 00:02:27,580
Wait.

30
00:02:41,140 --> 00:02:43,339
Sorry...

31
00:02:43,340 --> 00:02:45,499
Wrong day to die.

32
00:02:47,420 --> 00:02:49,300
Did you get a better offer?

33
00:02:52,620 --> 00:02:55,300
You'll be hearing from me, Sherlock.

34
00:02:59,740 --> 00:03:03,700
So if you have what you say you
have, I will make you rich.

35
00:03:06,460 --> 00:03:08,379
If you don't,

36
00:03:08,380 --> 00:03:11,459
I'll make you into shoes.

37
00:03:25,300 --> 00:03:26,540
What happened there?

38
00:03:28,460 --> 00:03:30,260
Someone changed his mind.

39
00:03:32,100 --> 00:03:33,140
The question is...

40
00:03:34,580 --> 00:03:35,940
who?

41
00:03:37,500 --> 00:03:40,859
Well, now, have you been wicked,
Your Highness?

42
00:03:40,860 --> 00:03:43,460
Yes, Miss Adler.

43
00:03:49,948 --> 00:03:53,148
2x01 
<i>- A Scandal in Belgravia -</i>

44
00:04:27,460 --> 00:04:28,819
What are you typing?

45
00:04:28,820 --> 00:04:31,219
Blog. About? Us.

46
00:04:31,220 --> 00:04:33,179
You mean me. Why?

47
00:04:33,180 --> 00:04:35,620
Well, you're typing a lot.

48
00:04:36,780 --> 00:04:38,099
Right, then.

49
00:04:38,100 --> 00:04:39,700
So, what have we got?

50
00:04:42,100 --> 00:04:46,699
My wife seems to be spending a very
long time at the office. Boring.

51
00:04:46,700 --> 00:04:49,980
I think my husband might be
having an affair. Yes.

52
00:04:50,980 --> 00:04:54,099
She's not my real aunt,
she's been replaced.

53
00:04:54,100 --> 00:04:55,140
I know she has.

54
00:04:55,141 --> 00:04:57,579
I know human ash. Leave.

55
00:04:57,580 --> 00:05:01,219
We are prepared to offer any
sum of money you care to mention

56
00:05:01,220 --> 00:05:03,379
for the recovery
of these files. Boring.

57
00:05:03,380 --> 00:05:06,819
We have this website, it explains
the true meaning of comic books,

58
00:05:06,820 --> 00:05:08,859
cos people miss a lot of the themes.

59
00:05:08,860 --> 00:05:11,779
But then all the comic books
started coming true.

60
00:05:11,780 --> 00:05:14,420
Interesting.

61
00:05:16,340 --> 00:05:19,019
Geek Interpreter, what's that?

62
00:05:19,020 --> 00:05:21,340
That's the title.
What does it need a title for?

63
00:05:24,740 --> 00:05:26,539
Do people actually read your blog?

64
00:05:26,540 --> 00:05:29,419
Where do you think our clients
come from? I have a website.

65
00:05:29,420 --> 00:05:31,720
In which you enumerate 240
different types of tobacco ash.

66
00:05:31,721 --> 00:05:34,019
Nobody's reading your website.

67
00:05:34,020 --> 00:05:38,459
Right then, dyed blonde hair,
no obvious cause of death,

68
00:05:38,460 --> 00:05:41,380
except for these speckles,
whatever they are.

69
00:05:45,780 --> 00:05:48,019
For God's sakes!

70
00:05:48,020 --> 00:05:50,300
What? The Speckled Blonde?!

71
00:05:53,380 --> 00:05:56,259
They wouldn't let us see
Granddad when he was dead.

72
00:05:56,260 --> 00:05:58,219
Is that cos he'd gone to heaven?

73
00:05:58,220 --> 00:06:00,499
People don't really go to heaven
when they die,

74
00:06:00,500 --> 00:06:02,619
they're taken to a
special room and burned.

75
00:06:02,620 --> 00:06:04,419
Sherlock...

76
00:06:04,420 --> 00:06:07,099
There was a plane
crash in Dusseldorf yesterday.

77
00:06:07,100 --> 00:06:09,659
Everyone dead.
Suspected terrorist bomb.

78
00:06:09,660 --> 00:06:12,419
We do watch the news.
You said "boring" and turned over.

79
00:06:12,420 --> 00:06:15,899
Well, according to the flight details,
this man was checked in on board.

80
00:06:15,900 --> 00:06:20,019
Inside his coat he's got a stub from his
boarding pass, napkins from the flight,

81
00:06:20,020 --> 00:06:21,780
even one of those special biscuits.

82
00:06:21,781 --> 00:06:24,179
Here's his passport,
stamped at Berlin Airport.

83
00:06:24,180 --> 00:06:27,899
So this man should have died in a
plane crash in Germany yesterday,

84
00:06:27,900 --> 00:06:30,059
but instead he's in a car boot
in Southwark.

85
00:06:30,060 --> 00:06:31,819
Lucky escape.

86
00:06:31,820 --> 00:06:33,219
Any ideas?

87
00:06:33,220 --> 00:06:34,940
Eight so far.

88
00:06:39,300 --> 00:06:40,380
OK, four ideas.

89
00:06:45,500 --> 00:06:46,660
Maybe two ideas.

90
00:06:48,580 --> 00:06:51,459
No, no, no,
don't mention the unsolved ones.

91
00:06:51,460 --> 00:06:54,059
People want to know you're human.
Why?

92
00:06:54,060 --> 00:06:56,160
Because they're interested.
No, they're not.

93
00:06:56,161 --> 00:06:58,259
Why are they? look at that.

94
00:06:58,260 --> 00:07:00,899
1,895. Sorry, what?

95
00:07:00,900 --> 00:07:03,100
I reset that counter last night.
This blog has

96
00:07:03,101 --> 00:07:05,299
had nearly 2,000 hits in
the last eight hours.

97
00:07:05,300 --> 00:07:10,379
This is your living, Sherlock, not
240 different types of tobacco ash.

98
00:07:10,380 --> 00:07:12,100
243.

99
00:07:13,860 --> 00:07:15,459
So what's this one?

100
00:07:15,460 --> 00:07:17,059
Belly Button Murders?

101
00:07:17,060 --> 00:07:18,220
The Navel Treatment?

102
00:07:20,380 --> 00:07:23,979
There's a lot of press outside, guys.
Well, they won't be interested in us.

103
00:07:23,980 --> 00:07:27,019
Yeah, that was before you were
an internet phenomenon.

104
00:07:27,020 --> 00:07:30,739
A couple of them specifically wanted
photographs of you two.

105
00:07:30,740 --> 00:07:31,780
God's sake!

106
00:07:33,260 --> 00:07:34,540
John?

107
00:07:35,580 --> 00:07:38,059
Cover your face and walk fast.

108
00:07:38,060 --> 00:07:40,579
Still, it's good for the public
image,

109
00:07:40,580 --> 00:07:41,979
big case like this.

110
00:07:41,980 --> 00:07:45,980
I'm a private detective, the last
thing I need is a public image.

111
00:08:13,340 --> 00:08:14,939
Hello.

112
00:08:14,940 --> 00:08:16,900
I think it's time, don't you?

113
00:08:47,460 --> 00:08:48,739
Dear!

114
00:08:48,740 --> 00:08:50,100
Thumbs!?

115
00:08:52,540 --> 00:08:54,899
The door was...

116
00:08:54,900 --> 00:08:56,620
The door was...

117
00:08:59,700 --> 00:09:02,860
Boys! You've got another one!

118
00:09:09,980 --> 00:09:15,379
Tell us from the start,
DON'T be boring.

119
00:10:09,980 --> 00:10:11,699
Hey!

120
00:10:11,700 --> 00:10:12,740
Are you OK?

121
00:10:15,220 --> 00:10:16,459
Excuse me!

122
00:10:16,460 --> 00:10:17,940
Are you all right?

123
00:10:28,540 --> 00:10:30,180
Sir, phone call for you.

124
00:10:32,340 --> 00:10:33,379
Carter.

125
00:10:33,380 --> 00:10:35,739
'Have you heard of Sherlock Holmes?'
Who?

126
00:10:35,740 --> 00:10:38,120
Well, you're about
to meet him now.

127
00:10:38,121 --> 00:10:40,499
This is your case, it's entirely
up to you, this is just...

128
00:10:40,500 --> 00:10:44,059
'..friendly advice, but give Sherlock
five minutes on your crime scene,

129
00:10:44,060 --> 00:10:47,819
'and listen to everything that he has
to say. And as far as possible... '

130
00:10:47,820 --> 00:10:49,220
try not to punch him.

131
00:10:50,260 --> 00:10:51,459
OK.

132
00:10:51,460 --> 00:10:55,019
Sir, this gentleman says he needs
to speak to you... Yes, I know.

133
00:10:55,020 --> 00:10:56,379
Sherlock Holmes.

134
00:10:56,380 --> 00:10:59,060
John Watson. Are you set up
for wi-fi?

135
00:11:00,380 --> 00:11:04,699
'You realise this is
a tiny bit humiliating?'

136
00:11:04,700 --> 00:11:06,899
It's OK, I'm fine.

137
00:11:06,900 --> 00:11:08,379
Now...

138
00:11:08,380 --> 00:11:09,540
show me to the stream.

139
00:11:09,541 --> 00:11:12,179
'I didn't really mean for you.'

140
00:11:12,180 --> 00:11:13,700
Look, this is a six.

141
00:11:15,020 --> 00:11:17,240
There's no point in my
leaving the flat for

142
00:11:17,241 --> 00:11:19,459
anything less than a
seven, we agreed.

143
00:11:19,460 --> 00:11:21,179
Now go back,

144
00:11:21,180 --> 00:11:22,218
show me the grass.

145
00:11:22,219 --> 00:11:23,420
When did we agree that?

146
00:11:23,421 --> 00:11:26,019
We agreed it yesterday. Stop!

147
00:11:26,020 --> 00:11:30,059
'Closer.' I wasn't even at home
yesterday. I was in Dublin.

148
00:11:30,060 --> 00:11:31,740
It's hardly my fault
you weren't listening.

149
00:11:33,420 --> 00:11:35,560
Shut up! 'Do you just carry
on talking when I'm away?

150
00:11:35,561 --> 00:11:37,699
' I don't know, how
often are you away?

151
00:11:37,700 --> 00:11:38,739
'Now...

152
00:11:38,740 --> 00:11:41,099
'..show me the car that backfired.

153
00:11:41,100 --> 00:11:42,539
It's there.

154
00:11:42,540 --> 00:11:44,580
'That's the one that made the noise,
yes?'

155
00:11:45,740 --> 00:11:46,779
Yeah.

156
00:11:46,780 --> 00:11:49,859
If you're thinking gunshot...
'..there wasn't one.

157
00:11:49,860 --> 00:11:51,100
'He wasn't shot,

158
00:11:51,101 --> 00:11:55,539
'he was killed by a single blow
to the back from a blunt instrument,

159
00:11:55,540 --> 00:11:59,139
'which then magically disappeared,
along with the killer.'

160
00:11:59,140 --> 00:12:00,819
It's got to be an eight, at least.

161
00:12:00,820 --> 00:12:03,200
You've got two more minutes,
they want to know more

162
00:12:03,201 --> 00:12:05,579
about the driver.
Forget him, he's an idiot.

163
00:12:05,580 --> 00:12:08,699
Why else would he think himself a
suspect? I think he's a suspect.

164
00:12:08,700 --> 00:12:13,219
'Pass me over.' All right, but there's
a mute button, and I will use it.

165
00:12:13,220 --> 00:12:15,819
Up a bit!
I'm not talking from down here!

166
00:12:15,820 --> 00:12:17,379
OK. Just take it, take it.

167
00:12:17,380 --> 00:12:21,179
'Having successfully committed
a crime without a single witness... '

168
00:12:21,180 --> 00:12:23,899
why would he call the police
and consult a detective?

169
00:12:23,900 --> 00:12:27,499
Fair play? He's trying to be clever.
It's overconfidence.

170
00:12:27,500 --> 00:12:30,080
Did you see him?
Morbidly obese, the undisguised

171
00:12:30,081 --> 00:12:32,659
halitosis of a single
man living on his own.

172
00:12:32,660 --> 00:12:35,080
The right sleeve of an
internet porn addict, the

173
00:12:35,081 --> 00:12:37,499
breathing pattern of an
untreated heart condition.

174
00:12:37,500 --> 00:12:39,900
Low self-esteem, tiny IQ and
a limited life expectancy,

175
00:12:39,901 --> 00:12:42,299
and you think he's a
criminal mastermind?!

176
00:12:42,300 --> 00:12:45,419
Don't worry, this is just stupid.
What did you say? Heart what?

177
00:12:45,420 --> 00:12:46,580
Go to the stream.

178
00:12:46,581 --> 00:12:48,379
What's in the stream?

179
00:12:48,380 --> 00:12:52,099
Go and see. Sherlock!
You weren't answering your doorbell.

180
00:12:52,100 --> 00:12:54,320
His room's through the back,
get him some clothes.

181
00:12:54,321 --> 00:12:56,539
Who the hell are you?
Sorry, Mr Holmes...

182
00:12:56,540 --> 00:12:59,160
'Sherlock, what's going on?
' You're coming with us.

183
00:12:59,161 --> 00:13:01,779
'What's happening?' I've lost him.
I don't know what...

184
00:13:01,780 --> 00:13:05,980
Dr Watson? Yeah. It's for you.
OK, thanks. No, sir, the helicopter.

185
00:13:18,220 --> 00:13:21,780
Please, Mr Holmes, where you're
going you'll want to be dressed.

186
00:13:44,700 --> 00:13:47,100
I know exactly where I'm going.

187
00:14:40,140 --> 00:14:43,300
You wearing any pants? No. OK.

188
00:14:54,620 --> 00:14:56,979
At Buckingham Palace. Right.

189
00:14:56,980 --> 00:15:01,379
Ha, ha. Aah, aah, I am seriously
fighting an impulse to steal an ashtray.

190
00:15:07,500 --> 00:15:12,139
What are we doing here, Sherlock,
seriously, what? I don't know.

191
00:15:12,140 --> 00:15:14,619
Here to see the Queen?

192
00:15:14,620 --> 00:15:16,620
Apparently, yes.

193
00:15:19,540 --> 00:15:23,179
Just once,
can you two behave like grown-ups?

194
00:15:23,180 --> 00:15:25,380
We solve crimes, I blog about
it, and he forgets his pants.

195
00:15:25,381 --> 00:15:27,579
I wouldn't hold out
too much hope.

196
00:15:27,580 --> 00:15:31,459
I was in the middle of a case, Mycroft.
What, the hiker and the backfire?

197
00:15:31,460 --> 00:15:33,600
I glanced at the police report,
a bit obvious, surely?

198
00:15:33,601 --> 00:15:35,739
Transparent.
Time to move on then.

199
00:15:38,860 --> 00:15:43,979
We are in Buckingham Palace, the
very heart of the British nation.

200
00:15:43,980 --> 00:15:47,619
Sherlock Holmes,
put your trousers on! What for?

201
00:15:47,620 --> 00:15:49,219
Your client.

202
00:15:49,220 --> 00:15:51,419
And my client is...?

203
00:15:51,420 --> 00:15:54,179
Illustrious, in the extreme.

204
00:15:54,180 --> 00:15:59,299
And remaining, I have to inform you,
entirely anonymous.

205
00:15:59,300 --> 00:16:00,739
Mycroft. Harry.

206
00:16:00,740 --> 00:16:03,280
May I just apologise for the
state of my little brother.

207
00:16:03,281 --> 00:16:05,819
A full-time occupation,
I imagine.

208
00:16:05,820 --> 00:16:08,440
And this must be Dr John
Watson, formerly of the

209
00:16:08,441 --> 00:16:11,059
Fifth Northumberland Fusiliers?
Hello, yes.

210
00:16:11,060 --> 00:16:14,899
My employer is a tremendous
fan of your blog. Your employer?

211
00:16:14,900 --> 00:16:19,259
Particularly enjoyed the one about the
aluminium crutch. Thank you...

212
00:16:19,260 --> 00:16:21,539
And Mr Holmes the Younger.

213
00:16:21,540 --> 00:16:23,820
You look taller in
your photographs.

214
00:16:23,821 --> 00:16:26,099
I take the precaution of a
good coat and a short friend.

215
00:16:26,100 --> 00:16:28,339
Mycroft, I don't do
anonymous clients.

216
00:16:28,340 --> 00:16:30,700
I'm used to mystery at
one end of my cases,

217
00:16:30,701 --> 00:16:33,060
both ends is too much work.
Good morning.

218
00:16:34,780 --> 00:16:38,539
This is a matter of national
importance. Grow up!

219
00:16:38,540 --> 00:16:40,299
Get off my sheet! Or what?

220
00:16:40,300 --> 00:16:41,899
Or I'll just walk away.

221
00:16:41,900 --> 00:16:44,619
I'll let you.
Boys, please... Not here.

222
00:16:44,620 --> 00:16:47,899
Who is my client?

223
00:16:47,900 --> 00:16:51,579
Take a look at where you're
standing, and make a deduction.

224
00:16:51,580 --> 00:16:56,099
You are to be engaged by the highest
in the land, now, for God's sake!

225
00:16:56,100 --> 00:16:58,619
Put your clothes on!

226
00:17:01,900 --> 00:17:04,019
I'll be mother.

227
00:17:04,020 --> 00:17:06,820
And there is a whole
childhood in a nutshell.

228
00:17:10,380 --> 00:17:12,620
My employer has a problem.

229
00:17:13,660 --> 00:17:16,120
A matter has come to
light of an extremely

230
00:17:16,121 --> 00:17:18,579
delicate and potentially
criminal nature,

231
00:17:18,580 --> 00:17:22,939
and in this hour of need, dear
brother, your name has arisen. Why?

232
00:17:22,940 --> 00:17:26,139
We have a police force of sorts,
even a marginally secret service.

233
00:17:26,140 --> 00:17:28,440
Why come to me?
People come to you for help, don't

234
00:17:28,441 --> 00:17:30,739
they, Mr Holmes?
Not to date anyone with a navy.

235
00:17:30,740 --> 00:17:34,179
This is a matter of the highest
security, and therefore of trust.

236
00:17:34,180 --> 00:17:37,179
You don't trust your own
secret service? Naturally not.

237
00:17:37,180 --> 00:17:39,179
They all spy on people for money.

238
00:17:39,180 --> 00:17:41,260
I do think we have a timetable.

239
00:17:42,420 --> 00:17:43,900
Yes, of course...

240
00:17:45,900 --> 00:17:47,700
What do you know about this woman?

241
00:17:51,860 --> 00:17:53,579
Nothing whatsoever.

242
00:17:53,580 --> 00:17:56,499
Then you should be paying more
attention.

243
00:17:57,540 --> 00:18:01,579
She's been at the centre of two
political scandals in the last year,

244
00:18:01,580 --> 00:18:05,219
and recently ended the marriage
of a prominent novelist

245
00:18:05,220 --> 00:18:09,299
by having an affair
with both participants separately.

246
00:18:09,300 --> 00:18:12,139
You know I don't concern myself
with trivia.

247
00:18:12,140 --> 00:18:13,460
Who is she?

248
00:18:14,500 --> 00:18:16,619
Irene Adler.

249
00:18:16,620 --> 00:18:20,059
Professionally known as "The Woman".

250
00:18:20,060 --> 00:18:21,419
Professionally?

251
00:18:21,420 --> 00:18:25,940
There are many names for what
she does. She prefers "dominatrix".

252
00:18:31,500 --> 00:18:33,659
Dominatrix. Don't be alarmed.

253
00:18:33,660 --> 00:18:35,139
It's to do with sex.

254
00:18:35,140 --> 00:18:36,540
Sex doesn't alarm me.

255
00:18:37,540 --> 00:18:40,219
How would you know?

256
00:18:40,220 --> 00:18:42,779
She provides, shall we say,
recreational scolding

257
00:18:42,780 --> 00:18:44,819
for those who enjoy
that sort of thing

258
00:18:44,820 --> 00:18:46,819
and are prepared to pay for it.

259
00:18:46,820 --> 00:18:49,580
These are all from her website.

260
00:19:13,740 --> 00:19:17,059
And I assume this Adler woman has
some compromising photographs.

261
00:19:17,060 --> 00:19:19,539
You're very quick, Mr Holmes.

262
00:19:19,540 --> 00:19:23,380
Hardly a difficult deduction.
Photographs of whom?

263
00:19:25,660 --> 00:19:27,699
A person of significance
to my employer.

264
00:19:27,700 --> 00:19:29,780
We'd prefer not to say
any more at this time.

265
00:19:29,781 --> 00:19:31,860
You can't tell us anything?

266
00:19:33,460 --> 00:19:35,340
I can tell you it's a young person.

267
00:19:36,900 --> 00:19:38,140
A young female person.

268
00:19:42,620 --> 00:19:44,139
How many photographs?

269
00:19:44,140 --> 00:19:46,059
A considerable number, apparently.

270
00:19:46,060 --> 00:19:48,240
Do Miss Adler and this
young female person

271
00:19:48,241 --> 00:19:50,419
appear in these photographs
together? Yes.

272
00:19:50,420 --> 00:19:52,580
I assume in a number of
compromising scenarios?

273
00:19:52,581 --> 00:19:54,739
An imaginative range,
we are assured.

274
00:19:54,740 --> 00:19:58,419
John, you might want to put that cup
back in your saucer now.

275
00:19:58,420 --> 00:20:01,779
Can you help us, Mr Holmes? How?
Will you take the case?

276
00:20:01,780 --> 00:20:02,819
What case?

277
00:20:02,820 --> 00:20:04,619
Pay her, now and in full.

278
00:20:04,620 --> 00:20:08,939
As Miss Adler remarks in her
masthead, know when you are beaten.

279
00:20:08,940 --> 00:20:10,860
She doesn't want anything.

280
00:20:12,140 --> 00:20:13,300
She got in touch.

281
00:20:13,301 --> 00:20:15,779
She informed us that the
photographs existed.

282
00:20:15,780 --> 00:20:18,539
She indicated that she had no
intention to use them

283
00:20:18,540 --> 00:20:21,459
to extort either money or favour.

284
00:20:21,460 --> 00:20:23,659
A power play.

285
00:20:23,660 --> 00:20:26,659
A power play with the most powerful
family in Britain.

286
00:20:26,660 --> 00:20:30,219
Now that is a dominatrix. This
is getting rather fun, isn't it.

287
00:20:30,220 --> 00:20:32,259
Sherlock... Where is she?

288
00:20:32,260 --> 00:20:34,600
In London, currently.
She's staying...

289
00:20:34,601 --> 00:20:36,939
Text me the details, I'll be in
touch by the end of the day.

290
00:20:36,940 --> 00:20:38,960
Do you really think
you'll have news by then?

291
00:20:38,961 --> 00:20:40,979
No, I think I'll have
the photographs.

292
00:20:40,980 --> 00:20:44,620
One can only hope
you're as good as you seem to think.

293
00:20:47,780 --> 00:20:49,740
I'll need some
equipment, of course.

294
00:20:49,741 --> 00:20:51,699
Anything you require,
I'll have it sent...

295
00:20:51,700 --> 00:20:53,920
Can I have a box of matches?
I'm sorry?

296
00:20:53,921 --> 00:20:56,139
Or your cigarette lighter,
either will do.

297
00:20:56,140 --> 00:20:59,940
I don't smoke. No, I know you don't,
but your employer does.

298
00:21:01,020 --> 00:21:03,979
We have kept a lot of people
successfully in the dark

299
00:21:03,980 --> 00:21:06,059
about this little fact, Mr Holmes.

300
00:21:06,060 --> 00:21:08,259
I'm not the Commonwealth.

301
00:21:08,260 --> 00:21:09,899
And that's as modest as he gets.

302
00:21:09,900 --> 00:21:11,060
Pleasure to meet you.

303
00:21:11,061 --> 00:21:13,340
Laters!

304
00:21:16,620 --> 00:21:20,300
OK, the smoking, how did you know?

305
00:21:21,340 --> 00:21:23,779
The evidence was right under
your nose, John,

306
00:21:23,780 --> 00:21:25,500
as ever you see, but do not observe.

307
00:21:25,501 --> 00:21:27,659
Observe what? The ashtray.

308
00:21:38,380 --> 00:21:40,379
Kate?

309
00:21:40,380 --> 00:21:42,699
We're going to have a visitor.

310
00:21:42,700 --> 00:21:45,179
I'll need a bit of time
to get ready.

311
00:21:45,180 --> 00:21:46,859
A long time?

312
00:21:46,860 --> 00:21:49,940
.. Ages.

313
00:22:04,900 --> 00:22:06,299
What are you doing?

314
00:22:06,300 --> 00:22:08,619
I'm going to into battle, John.

315
00:22:08,620 --> 00:22:11,139
I need the right armour.

316
00:22:11,140 --> 00:22:12,419
No.

317
00:22:12,420 --> 00:22:13,579
Nah.

318
00:22:13,580 --> 00:22:15,019
Works for me.

319
00:22:15,020 --> 00:22:17,019
Everything works on you.

320
00:22:17,020 --> 00:22:18,819
So, what's the plan?

321
00:22:18,820 --> 00:22:20,819
We know her address.

322
00:22:20,820 --> 00:22:23,040
We just ring her doorbell?
Exactly. Just here, please.

323
00:22:23,041 --> 00:22:25,259
You didn't even
change your clothes.

324
00:22:25,260 --> 00:22:27,340
Then it's time to add
a splash of colour.

325
00:22:34,180 --> 00:22:35,899
Are we here?

326
00:22:35,900 --> 00:22:38,139
Two streets away, but this will do.

327
00:22:38,140 --> 00:22:40,419
For what? Punch me in the face.

328
00:22:40,420 --> 00:22:41,900
Shade?

329
00:22:43,060 --> 00:22:44,859
Blood.

330
00:22:44,860 --> 00:22:48,299
Punch you? Yes, punch me,
in the face. Didn't you hear me?

331
00:22:48,300 --> 00:22:51,659
I always hear "punch me" when you
speak but it's usually sub-text.

332
00:22:51,660 --> 00:22:53,620
For God's sakes!

333
00:22:59,340 --> 00:23:01,060
Thank you, that was...

334
00:23:04,460 --> 00:23:06,139
OK, I think we're done now, John!

335
00:23:06,140 --> 00:23:10,019
You want to remember, Sherlock,
I was a soldier. I killed people.

336
00:23:10,020 --> 00:23:12,300
You were a doctor!
I had bad days!

337
00:23:14,300 --> 00:23:16,219
What are you going to wear?

338
00:23:16,220 --> 00:23:18,819
My battle dress. Lucky boy.

339
00:23:27,100 --> 00:23:28,459
Hello?

340
00:23:28,460 --> 00:23:33,459
Very sorry to disturb you, um,
I've just been attacked, um,

341
00:23:33,460 --> 00:23:37,659
um, and I think they,
they took my wallet

342
00:23:37,660 --> 00:23:40,019
and, um, and my phone.

343
00:23:40,020 --> 00:23:43,099
Please could you help me?

344
00:23:43,100 --> 00:23:45,659
I can phone the police, if you want?

345
00:23:45,660 --> 00:23:47,980
Thank you. Could you, please?
Would you mind

346
00:23:47,981 --> 00:23:50,299
if I just waited here,
just until they come?

347
00:23:50,300 --> 00:23:52,139
Thank you, thank you so much.

348
00:23:55,340 --> 00:23:57,819
Thank you.

349
00:23:57,820 --> 00:24:00,019
I saw it all happen.

350
00:24:00,020 --> 00:24:01,800
It's OK, I'm a doctor.
Have you got a first aid kit?

351
00:24:01,801 --> 00:24:03,579
In the kitchen. Please.

352
00:24:03,580 --> 00:24:04,940
Thank you. Thank you.

353
00:24:06,460 --> 00:24:08,539
Hello,
sorry to hear you've been hurt.

354
00:24:08,540 --> 00:24:11,780
I don't think Kate caught your name?
I'm so sorry, I'm...

355
00:24:17,060 --> 00:24:21,300
It's always hard to remember an alias
when you've had a fright. Isn't it?

356
00:24:22,420 --> 00:24:24,379
Well, there now.

357
00:24:24,380 --> 00:24:26,100
We're both defrocked...

358
00:24:27,820 --> 00:24:29,259
Mr Sherlock Holmes.

359
00:24:29,260 --> 00:24:34,299
Miss Adler, I presume.
Look at those cheekbones.

360
00:24:34,300 --> 00:24:37,859
I could cut myself
slapping that face.

361
00:24:37,860 --> 00:24:39,740
Would you like me to try?

362
00:24:41,780 --> 00:24:44,540
Right, this should do it.

363
00:24:47,860 --> 00:24:50,300
I've missed something, haven't I?

364
00:24:51,740 --> 00:24:55,699
Please, sit down. Or if you'd like
some tea, I can call the maid.

365
00:24:55,700 --> 00:24:59,700
I had some at the Palace.
I know. Clearly.

366
00:25:04,460 --> 00:25:07,900
I had a tea too, at the Palace.
If anyone's interested.

367
00:25:30,660 --> 00:25:33,899
Do you know the big problem
with a disguise, Mr Holmes?

368
00:25:33,900 --> 00:25:37,339
However hard you try,
it's always a self-portrait.

369
00:25:37,340 --> 00:25:40,299
You think I'm a vicar
with a bleeding face?

370
00:25:40,300 --> 00:25:42,419
No, I think you're damaged,
delusional

371
00:25:42,420 --> 00:25:45,580
and believe in a higher power.
In your case, it's yourself.

372
00:25:46,900 --> 00:25:48,979
And somebody loves you.

373
00:25:48,980 --> 00:25:53,140
If I had to punch that face,
I'd avoid your nose and teeth, too.

374
00:25:54,380 --> 00:25:56,579
Could you put something on, please?

375
00:25:56,580 --> 00:26:00,819
Anything at all. A napkin?
Why? Are you feeling exposed?

376
00:26:00,820 --> 00:26:03,379
I don't think John knows
where to look.

377
00:26:03,380 --> 00:26:06,180
No, I think he knows exactly where.

378
00:26:07,820 --> 00:26:09,379
I'm not sure about you.

379
00:26:09,380 --> 00:26:12,299
If I was to look at naked women,
I'd borrow John's laptop.

380
00:26:12,300 --> 00:26:14,499
You do borrow my laptop.
I confiscate it.

381
00:26:14,500 --> 00:26:16,420
Never mind, we've got better
things to talk about.

382
00:26:16,421 --> 00:26:18,339
Now, tell me, I need to know

383
00:26:18,340 --> 00:26:21,019
how was it done?

384
00:26:21,020 --> 00:26:22,659
What?

385
00:26:22,660 --> 00:26:26,779
The hiker with the bashed-in head...
how was he killed?

386
00:26:26,780 --> 00:26:29,739
That's not why I'm here.

387
00:26:29,740 --> 00:26:31,899
You're here for the photographs,

388
00:26:31,900 --> 00:26:34,180
but that's never going to happen
and as we're chatting...

389
00:26:34,181 --> 00:26:36,459
That story's not out.
How do you know about it?

390
00:26:36,460 --> 00:26:40,259
I know one of the policemen.
Well, I know what he likes.

391
00:26:40,260 --> 00:26:43,739
And you... like policemen?

392
00:26:43,740 --> 00:26:46,620
I like detective stories.
And detectives.

393
00:26:47,820 --> 00:26:49,779
Brainy is the new sexy.

394
00:26:49,780 --> 00:26:52,299
The position of the car
relative to the hiker,

395
00:26:52,300 --> 00:26:54,580
that and the fact that the
death blow was to the

396
00:26:54,581 --> 00:26:56,859
back of the head, that's
all you need to know.

397
00:26:56,860 --> 00:26:59,979
OK, tell me,
how was he murdered? He wasn't.

398
00:26:59,980 --> 00:27:03,659
You don't think it was murder?
I know it wasn't. How? The same way

399
00:27:03,660 --> 00:27:07,259
I know the victim was a sportsman,
recently returned from foreign travel

400
00:27:07,260 --> 00:27:11,179
and that the photographs I'm looking
for are in this room. OK, but how?

401
00:27:11,180 --> 00:27:13,100
So they are in this room. Thank you.

402
00:27:13,101 --> 00:27:15,620
John, man the door, let no-one in.

403
00:27:25,460 --> 00:27:30,539
Two men alone in the countryside,
several yards apart and one car.

404
00:27:30,540 --> 00:27:34,179
I, I thought you were looking
for the photos now. No, no.

405
00:27:34,180 --> 00:27:36,819
Looking takes ages,
I'm just going to find them,

406
00:27:36,820 --> 00:27:39,140
but you're clever and we've
got a moment, so let's

407
00:27:39,141 --> 00:27:41,459
pass the time.
Two men, a car, nobody else.

408
00:27:41,460 --> 00:27:44,939
Driver's trying to fix his engine.

409
00:27:44,940 --> 00:27:47,099
Getting nowhere.

410
00:27:47,100 --> 00:27:50,259
And the hiker is taking a moment,
looking at the sky.

411
00:27:50,260 --> 00:27:54,059
Watching the birds? Any moment now,
something is going to happen. What?

412
00:27:54,060 --> 00:27:56,460
The hiker is going to die.

413
00:27:56,461 --> 00:27:58,859
No, that's the result.
What's going to happen?

414
00:27:58,860 --> 00:28:02,539
I don't understand.
Well try to.

415
00:28:02,540 --> 00:28:05,259
Why? Because you cater
to the whims of the pathetic

416
00:28:05,260 --> 00:28:08,220
and take your clothes off
to make an impression.

417
00:28:08,221 --> 00:28:11,179
Stop boring me and think.
It's the new sexy.

418
00:28:11,180 --> 00:28:15,899
The car's going to backfire. There's
going to be a loud noise. So what?

419
00:28:15,900 --> 00:28:19,340
Noises are important. They can
tell you everything. For instance...

420
00:28:27,700 --> 00:28:29,299
Thank you.

421
00:28:29,300 --> 00:28:32,739
On hearing a smoke alarm, a mother
would look towards her child.

422
00:28:32,740 --> 00:28:35,540
Amazing how fire
exposes our priorities.

423
00:28:39,660 --> 00:28:43,059
I really hope you don't have
a baby in here.

424
00:28:43,060 --> 00:28:46,379
All right, John,
you can turn it off now.

425
00:28:46,380 --> 00:28:48,339
I said you can turn it off now!

426
00:28:48,340 --> 00:28:50,420
Give me a minute!

427
00:28:56,500 --> 00:28:57,739
Thank you.

428
00:28:59,620 --> 00:29:02,699
You should always use gloves
with these things, you know.

429
00:29:02,700 --> 00:29:05,299
Heaviest oil deposit is always
on the first key used,

430
00:29:05,300 --> 00:29:08,060
that's a 3, but after
that, the sequence is

431
00:29:08,061 --> 00:29:10,819
impossible to read.
I see it's a six digit code.

432
00:29:10,820 --> 00:29:13,140
It can't be your birthday,
no disrespect, but you

433
00:29:13,141 --> 00:29:15,459
were born in the '80s and
8's barely used, so...

434
00:29:15,460 --> 00:29:19,380
I'd tell you the code right now,
but you know what? I already have.

435
00:29:20,740 --> 00:29:22,140
Think.

436
00:29:23,100 --> 00:29:26,819
Hands behind your head,
on the floor, keep it still!

437
00:29:26,820 --> 00:29:29,739
Sorry, Sherlock.
Miss Adler, on the floor!

438
00:29:29,740 --> 00:29:34,219
Don't you want me on the floor, too?
No, sir, I want you to open the safe.

439
00:29:34,220 --> 00:29:38,179
American. Interesting.
Why would you care?

440
00:29:38,180 --> 00:29:40,860
Sir, the safe, now, please.
I don't know the code.

441
00:29:40,861 --> 00:29:43,539
We've been listening,
she said she told you.

442
00:29:43,540 --> 00:29:46,060
If you've been listening,
you'll know she didn't.

443
00:29:46,061 --> 00:29:48,579
I assume I missed something.
From your reputation,

444
00:29:48,580 --> 00:29:51,139
I assume you didn't, Mr Holmes.

445
00:29:51,140 --> 00:29:53,339
She's the one
who knows the code, ask her!

446
00:29:53,340 --> 00:29:55,860
Yes, sir, she also knows
the code that calls

447
00:29:55,861 --> 00:29:58,379
the police and sets off
the burglar alarm.

448
00:29:58,380 --> 00:30:01,579
I've learned not to trust her.
Mr Holmes doesn't... Shut up!

449
00:30:01,580 --> 00:30:03,219
One more word out of you,

450
00:30:03,220 --> 00:30:07,339
just one and I will decorate that
wall with the insides of your head.

451
00:30:07,340 --> 00:30:09,979
That, for me,
will not be a hardship.

452
00:30:09,980 --> 00:30:15,179
Mr Archer, at the count of three,
shoot Dr Watson. What?

453
00:30:15,180 --> 00:30:17,379
I don't know the code. One.

454
00:30:17,380 --> 00:30:21,699
I don't know the code. Two.
She didn't tell me, I don't know it!

455
00:30:21,700 --> 00:30:26,019
I'm prepared to believe you,
any second now.

456
00:30:26,020 --> 00:30:27,260
Three! No, stop!

457
00:30:48,900 --> 00:30:52,140
Thank you, Mr Holmes.
Open it, please.

458
00:30:56,540 --> 00:30:58,460
Vatican cameos!

459
00:31:16,100 --> 00:31:17,380
Do you mind? Not at all.

460
00:31:23,580 --> 00:31:27,619
He's dead. Thank you.
You were very observant. Observant?

461
00:31:27,620 --> 00:31:30,699
I'm flattered. Don't be. Flattered?

462
00:31:30,700 --> 00:31:34,380
There'll be more of them, they'll be
keeping an eye on the building.

463
00:31:39,300 --> 00:31:41,500
We should call the police. Yes.

464
00:31:44,980 --> 00:31:47,059
On their way. For God's sake!

465
00:31:47,060 --> 00:31:48,260
Shut up, it's quick.

466
00:31:48,261 --> 00:31:52,059
Check the rest of the house,
see how they got in.

467
00:31:52,060 --> 00:31:57,180
Well, that's the knighthood
in the bag. And that's mine.

468
00:32:00,100 --> 00:32:02,280
All the photographs are
on here, I presume?

469
00:32:02,281 --> 00:32:04,459
I have copies, of course.
No, you don't.

470
00:32:04,460 --> 00:32:08,939
You'll have permanently disabled
any kind of uplink or connection.

471
00:32:08,940 --> 00:32:12,339
Unless the contents of this phone
are unique, you couldn't sell them.

472
00:32:12,340 --> 00:32:16,019
Who said I'm selling?
Well, why would they be interested?

473
00:32:16,020 --> 00:32:18,920
Whatever's on the phone, it's
clearly not just photographs.

474
00:32:18,921 --> 00:32:21,819
That camera-phone is
my life, Mr Holmes.

475
00:32:21,820 --> 00:32:25,059
I'd die before I let you take it.
It's my protection.

476
00:32:25,060 --> 00:32:27,260
Sherlock! It was.

477
00:32:43,780 --> 00:32:45,540
Must have come in this way. Clearly.

478
00:32:47,100 --> 00:32:48,980
It's all right, she's just out cold.

479
00:32:48,981 --> 00:32:50,981
God knows she's used to that.

480
00:32:50,982 --> 00:32:52,980
There's a back door.
Better check it, Dr Watson.

481
00:32:54,540 --> 00:32:56,940
Sure.

482
00:32:58,420 --> 00:32:59,940
You're very calm.

483
00:33:01,300 --> 00:33:04,779
Well, your booby trap did just
kill a man. He would have killed me.

484
00:33:04,780 --> 00:33:06,500
It was self defence in advance.

485
00:33:10,260 --> 00:33:13,099
What is that?! What?

486
00:33:13,100 --> 00:33:15,139
Give it to me.

487
00:33:15,140 --> 00:33:17,259
Now. Give it to me.

488
00:33:17,260 --> 00:33:19,459
No.

489
00:33:19,460 --> 00:33:21,819
Give it to me. No.

490
00:33:21,820 --> 00:33:23,819
For goodness sake!

491
00:33:23,820 --> 00:33:25,499
Drop it.

492
00:33:25,500 --> 00:33:29,099
I... said... drop it!

493
00:33:29,100 --> 00:33:32,059
Thank you, dear.

494
00:33:32,060 --> 00:33:35,979
Now, tell that sweet little posh
thing the pictures are safe with me.

495
00:33:35,980 --> 00:33:39,939
They're not for blackmail,
just for insurance.

496
00:33:39,940 --> 00:33:43,019
Besides,
I might want to see her again.

497
00:33:43,020 --> 00:33:46,859
No no no no no.

498
00:33:46,860 --> 00:33:48,659
It's been a pleasure.

499
00:33:48,660 --> 00:33:51,619
Don't spoil it.

500
00:33:51,620 --> 00:33:54,299
This is how I want you
to remember me,

501
00:33:54,300 --> 00:33:57,780
the woman who beat you.

502
00:34:00,300 --> 00:34:02,419
Goodnight, Mr Sherlock Holmes.

503
00:34:02,420 --> 00:34:05,179
Jesus! What are you doing?
He'll sleep for a few hours.

504
00:34:05,180 --> 00:34:07,540
Make sure he doesn't choke
on his own vomit, it

505
00:34:07,541 --> 00:34:09,899
makes for a very unattractive corpse.
What's this?

506
00:34:09,900 --> 00:34:12,539
What have you given him?
Sherlock? He'll be fine.

507
00:34:12,540 --> 00:34:16,779
I've used it on loads of my friends.
Sherlock, can you hear me?

508
00:34:16,780 --> 00:34:19,180
You know, I was wrong about him.
He did know where to look.

509
00:34:19,181 --> 00:34:21,579
For what?
What are you talking about?

510
00:34:21,580 --> 00:34:25,219
The key-code to my safe.
What was it?

511
00:34:25,220 --> 00:34:27,020
Shall I tell him?

512
00:34:31,060 --> 00:34:33,059
My measurements.

513
00:34:46,340 --> 00:34:47,899
Got it!

514
00:34:47,900 --> 00:34:53,580
Ssh ssh no, don't get up,
I'll do the talking.

515
00:34:56,380 --> 00:35:02,779
So, the car's about to backfire and
the hiker, he's staring at the sky.

516
00:35:02,780 --> 00:35:06,059
You said he could be watching
birds, but he wasn't, was he?

517
00:35:06,060 --> 00:35:08,779
He was watching
another kind of flying thing.

518
00:35:08,780 --> 00:35:12,100
The car backfires
and the hiker turns to look...

519
00:35:14,660 --> 00:35:17,179
which was his big mistake.

520
00:35:17,180 --> 00:35:19,420
By the time the driver looks
up, the hiker is already dead.

521
00:35:19,421 --> 00:35:21,659
He doesn't see what killed him

522
00:35:21,660 --> 00:35:26,259
because it's already being
washed downstream.

523
00:35:26,260 --> 00:35:30,699
An accomplished sportsman recently
returned from foreign travel with...

524
00:35:30,700 --> 00:35:32,500
a boomerang.

525
00:35:33,900 --> 00:35:35,699
You got that from one look?

526
00:35:35,700 --> 00:35:38,020
Definitely the new sexy.

527
00:35:40,060 --> 00:35:42,060
I...

528
00:35:44,500 --> 00:35:46,460
I...

529
00:35:54,740 --> 00:35:56,579
Hush, now.

530
00:35:56,580 --> 00:35:58,300
It's OK.

531
00:36:00,020 --> 00:36:03,100
I'm only returning your coat.

532
00:36:08,700 --> 00:36:10,140
John?

533
00:36:11,460 --> 00:36:12,780
John!

534
00:36:17,660 --> 00:36:19,899
You OK? How did I get here?

535
00:36:19,900 --> 00:36:23,259
I don't suppose you remember much,
you weren't making a lot of sense.

536
00:36:23,260 --> 00:36:27,659
I should warn you, I think
Lestrade filmed you on his phone.

537
00:36:27,660 --> 00:36:30,819
Where is she? Where's who?
The woman, that woman. What woman?

538
00:36:30,820 --> 00:36:33,979
The Woman! The Woman, woman!
Irene Adler?

539
00:36:33,980 --> 00:36:37,180
She got away, no-one saw her.
She wasn't here, Sherlock.

540
00:36:38,700 --> 00:36:43,179
What are you?
What? No, no, no. No. Back to bed.

541
00:36:43,180 --> 00:36:46,739
You'll be fine in the morning.
Just sleep.

542
00:36:46,740 --> 00:36:49,979
Of course I'll be fine,
I am fine. I'm absolutely fine.

543
00:36:49,980 --> 00:36:53,139
Yes, you're great. Now,
I'll be next door if you need me.

544
00:36:53,140 --> 00:36:55,980
Why would I need you?
No reason at all.

545
00:37:37,540 --> 00:37:41,459
The photographs are perfectly safe.
In the hands of a fugitive sex worker?

546
00:37:41,460 --> 00:37:43,499
She's not interested in blackmail.

547
00:37:43,500 --> 00:37:46,579
She wants... protection,
for some reason.

548
00:37:46,580 --> 00:37:48,800
I take it you've stood
down the police

549
00:37:48,801 --> 00:37:51,019
investigation into the
shooting at her house?

550
00:37:51,020 --> 00:37:55,259
How can we do anything while she has
the photographs? Our hands are tied.

551
00:37:55,260 --> 00:37:57,619
She'd applaud your choice of words.

552
00:37:57,620 --> 00:38:01,139
You see how this works? The camera-phone
is her get out of jail free card.

553
00:38:01,140 --> 00:38:04,139
You have to leave her alone.
Treat her like royalty, Mycroft.

554
00:38:04,140 --> 00:38:06,539
Though not the way she treats
royalty.

555
00:38:08,180 --> 00:38:10,699
What was that?

556
00:38:10,700 --> 00:38:12,540
Text.
But what was that noise?

557
00:38:14,220 --> 00:38:17,019
Did you know there were
other people after her too

558
00:38:17,020 --> 00:38:19,019
before you sent John and I in there?

559
00:38:19,020 --> 00:38:21,699
CIA trained killers, I think.
Thanks for that.

560
00:38:21,700 --> 00:38:25,379
It's a disgrace, sending your little
brother into danger like that.

561
00:38:25,380 --> 00:38:29,019
Family is all we have in the end,
Mycroft Holmes!

562
00:38:29,020 --> 00:38:31,260
Shut up, Mrs Hudson!
Mycroft!!

563
00:38:37,660 --> 00:38:41,139
Apologies. Thank you.
Though do in fact shut up.

564
00:38:43,420 --> 00:38:45,939
It's a bit rude,
that noise, isn't it?

565
00:38:45,940 --> 00:38:49,979
There's nothing you can do and nothing
she will do, as far as I can see.

566
00:38:49,980 --> 00:38:53,299
I can put maximum
surveillance on her.

567
00:38:53,300 --> 00:38:58,299
Why bother?
You can follow her on Twitter.

568
00:38:58,300 --> 00:39:01,259
I believe her user name is
The Whip Hand.

569
00:39:01,260 --> 00:39:03,700
Most amusing. Excuse me. Hello?

570
00:39:09,740 --> 00:39:14,139
Why does your phone make that noise?

571
00:39:14,140 --> 00:39:16,819
What noise?
That noise, the one it just made.

572
00:39:16,820 --> 00:39:18,819
It's a text alert,
means I've got a text.

573
00:39:18,820 --> 00:39:22,179
Your texts don't usually
make that noise.

574
00:39:22,180 --> 00:39:25,619
Well, somebody got hold of the phone
and apparently as a joke,

575
00:39:25,620 --> 00:39:27,939
personalised their text alert noise.

576
00:39:27,940 --> 00:39:30,660
So every time they text you...

577
00:39:31,620 --> 00:39:33,859
It would seem so.

578
00:39:33,860 --> 00:39:39,019
Could you turn that phone down a
bit? At my time of life it's...

579
00:39:42,180 --> 00:39:45,379
See I'm wondering who could have
got hold of your phone.

580
00:39:45,380 --> 00:39:48,780
It would've been in your coat.
I'll leave you to your deductions.

581
00:39:51,140 --> 00:39:52,779
I'm not stupid, you know.

582
00:39:52,780 --> 00:39:54,699
Where do you get that idea?

583
00:39:54,700 --> 00:39:57,739
Bond Air is go, that's decided.
Check with the Coventry lot.

584
00:39:57,740 --> 00:39:59,979
Talk later.

585
00:39:59,980 --> 00:40:02,859
What else does she have?

586
00:40:02,860 --> 00:40:06,339
Irene Adler. The Americans
wouldn't be interested in her

587
00:40:06,340 --> 00:40:09,019
for a couple of
compromising photographs.

588
00:40:09,020 --> 00:40:12,699
There's more. Much more.

589
00:40:12,700 --> 00:40:16,099
Something big's coming, isn't it?

590
00:40:16,100 --> 00:40:20,419
Irene Adler is no longer
any concern of yours.

591
00:40:20,420 --> 00:40:24,259
From now on,
you will stay out of this.

592
00:40:24,260 --> 00:40:27,579
Will I? Yes, Sherlock.

593
00:40:27,580 --> 00:40:29,100
You will.

594
00:40:32,340 --> 00:40:33,939
Now if you'll excuse me,

595
00:40:33,940 --> 00:40:37,659
I have a long and arduous apology
to make to a very old friend.

596
00:40:37,660 --> 00:40:39,219
Do give her my love.

597
00:41:11,740 --> 00:41:14,179
Lovely, Sherlock. That was lovely.

598
00:41:14,180 --> 00:41:16,499
Marvellous. Yes, very good.

599
00:41:16,500 --> 00:41:18,460
I wish you could have worn
the antlers.

600
00:41:18,461 --> 00:41:21,939
Some things are best left to the
imagination, Mrs Hudson. Mrs H?

601
00:41:21,940 --> 00:41:25,139
No thank you, Sarah. No, no,
he's not good with names.

602
00:41:25,140 --> 00:41:26,340
No, I can get this.

603
00:41:26,341 --> 00:41:29,259
Sarah was the doctor, then there was
the one with the spots,

604
00:41:29,260 --> 00:41:33,699
then the one with the nose and then,
who was after the boring teacher?

605
00:41:33,700 --> 00:41:37,899
Nobody. Jeanette! Process
of elimination. Dear Lord.

606
00:41:37,900 --> 00:41:41,899
Hello, everyone.
It said on the door to come up.

607
00:41:41,900 --> 00:41:43,939
Hello, Molly. Hello, Molly!

608
00:41:43,940 --> 00:41:47,539
Everybody saying hello to each
other, how wonderful!

609
00:41:47,540 --> 00:41:49,979
Let me, er... Holy Mary!

610
00:41:49,980 --> 00:41:53,579
So we're having Christmas drinkies?
No stopping them, apparently.

611
00:41:53,580 --> 00:41:57,499
It's the one day of the year where
the boys have to be nice to me,

612
00:41:57,500 --> 00:41:59,619
so it's almost worth it.

613
00:41:59,620 --> 00:42:02,160
John? The counter on
your blog still says 1895.

614
00:42:02,161 --> 00:42:04,699
No, Christmas is cancelled

615
00:42:04,700 --> 00:42:09,019
And you've got a photograph of me
wearing that hat! People like it.

616
00:42:09,020 --> 00:42:11,499
No, they don't. What people?
How's the hip?

617
00:42:11,500 --> 00:42:13,779
It's atrocious,
but thanks for asking.

618
00:42:13,780 --> 00:42:16,619
I've seen much worse,
but then I do post-mortems.

619
00:42:16,620 --> 00:42:20,899
God, sorry.
Don't make jokes, Molly.

620
00:42:20,900 --> 00:42:24,139
No, sorry. Here you are. Thank you.
I wasn't expecting to see you.

621
00:42:24,140 --> 00:42:27,019
I thought you were in Dorset
for Christmas?

622
00:42:27,020 --> 00:42:30,419
First thing in the morning, me and
the wife, back together, sorted.

623
00:42:30,420 --> 00:42:33,339
No, she's sleeping with a PE
teacher.

624
00:42:33,340 --> 00:42:36,739
And John, I hear you're off
to your sister's? Yeah.

625
00:42:36,740 --> 00:42:38,979
Sherlock was complaining. Saying.

626
00:42:38,980 --> 00:42:41,859
First time ever, she's cleaned up
her act, off the booze.

627
00:42:41,860 --> 00:42:43,299
Nope. Shut up, Sherlock!

628
00:42:43,300 --> 00:42:47,419
I see you've got a new boyfriend, Molly.
You're serious about him. Sorry, what?

629
00:42:47,420 --> 00:42:50,379
You're seeing him tonight, giving
him a gift. Take a day off.

630
00:42:50,380 --> 00:42:52,320
Shut up. Have a drink.
Surely you see the

631
00:42:52,321 --> 00:42:54,259
perfectly wrapped
present in the bag.

632
00:42:54,260 --> 00:42:56,979
The others are slapdash.
It's for someone special.

633
00:42:56,980 --> 00:43:01,139
The shade of red echoes her lipstick
... an unconscious association,

634
00:43:01,140 --> 00:43:03,440
or one she's deliberately
trying to encourage.

635
00:43:03,441 --> 00:43:05,739
Either way, Miss Hooper
has love on her mind.

636
00:43:05,740 --> 00:43:09,539
That she's serious about him is clear
from the fact she's giving him a gift.

637
00:43:09,540 --> 00:43:11,819
It suggests long-term hopes.

638
00:43:11,820 --> 00:43:15,219
That she's seeing him tonight is
evident from her make-up and clothes.

639
00:43:15,220 --> 00:43:19,380
Obviously trying to compensate for
the size of her mouth and breasts.

640
00:43:27,300 --> 00:43:29,339
You always say such horrible things.

641
00:43:29,340 --> 00:43:33,259
Every time. Always.

642
00:43:33,260 --> 00:43:34,780
Always.

643
00:43:38,940 --> 00:43:41,060
I am sorry. Forgive me.

644
00:43:46,020 --> 00:43:48,219
Merry Christmas, Molly Hooper.

645
00:43:51,140 --> 00:43:53,499
No!
That wasn't, I didn't...

646
00:43:53,500 --> 00:43:56,059
No, it was me. My God, really?

647
00:43:56,060 --> 00:43:57,659
What? My phone.

648
00:43:57,660 --> 00:44:00,459
Fifty seven? Sorry, what?

649
00:44:00,460 --> 00:44:03,419
Fifty seven of those texts,
the ones I've heard.

650
00:44:03,420 --> 00:44:06,380
Thrilling that you've been counting.

651
00:44:14,300 --> 00:44:16,019
Excuse me.

652
00:44:16,020 --> 00:44:17,699
What's up, Sherlock?

653
00:44:17,700 --> 00:44:19,700
I said excuse me.
Do you ever reply?

654
00:44:49,260 --> 00:44:53,219
Dear Lord, we're not going to have
Christmas phone calls now, are we?

655
00:44:53,220 --> 00:44:55,419
Have they passed a new law?

656
00:44:55,420 --> 00:44:58,259
I think you're going to find
Irene Adler tonight.

657
00:44:58,260 --> 00:45:00,219
We already know where she is.

658
00:45:00,220 --> 00:45:03,939
As you were kind enough to point
out, it hardly matters.

659
00:45:03,940 --> 00:45:06,180
No, I mean you're going
to find her dead.

660
00:45:08,700 --> 00:45:10,540
You OK? Yes.

661
00:45:28,900 --> 00:45:31,099
The only one who fitted
the description.

662
00:45:31,100 --> 00:45:33,219
Had her brought here,
your home from home.

663
00:45:33,220 --> 00:45:35,139
You didn't need to come in, Molly.

664
00:45:35,140 --> 00:45:38,459
It's OK, everyone else
is busy with... Christmas.

665
00:45:38,460 --> 00:45:43,540
The face is a bit sort of bashed-up,
so it might be a bit difficult.

666
00:45:48,060 --> 00:45:50,660
That's her, isn't it?
Show me the rest of her.

667
00:45:55,820 --> 00:45:57,019
That's her.

668
00:45:57,020 --> 00:45:59,059
Thank you, Miss Hooper.

669
00:45:59,060 --> 00:46:03,900
Who is she? How did Sherlock
recognise her from... not her face?

670
00:46:22,740 --> 00:46:27,500
Just the one. Why?
Merry Christmas.

671
00:46:31,940 --> 00:46:36,300
Smoking indoors, isn't there one
of those... one of those law things?

672
00:46:38,500 --> 00:46:40,099
We're in a morgue.

673
00:46:40,100 --> 00:46:42,180
There's only
so much damage you can do.

674
00:46:44,060 --> 00:46:46,379
How did you know she was dead?

675
00:46:46,380 --> 00:46:52,019
She had an item in her possession,
one she said her life depended on.

676
00:46:52,020 --> 00:46:56,820
She chose to give it up.
Where is this item now?

677
00:47:00,340 --> 00:47:02,499
Look at them.

678
00:47:02,500 --> 00:47:06,020
They all care so much.

679
00:47:08,860 --> 00:47:12,459
Do you ever wonder
if there's something wrong with us?

680
00:47:12,460 --> 00:47:17,339
All lives end,
all hearts are broken.

681
00:47:17,340 --> 00:47:22,900
Caring is not an advantage,
Sherlock.

682
00:47:26,500 --> 00:47:28,579
This is low tar.

683
00:47:28,580 --> 00:47:31,899
Well, you barely knew her.

684
00:47:36,500 --> 00:47:38,260
Merry Christmas, Mycroft.

685
00:47:40,940 --> 00:47:43,380
And a happy new year.

686
00:47:53,540 --> 00:47:55,979
He's on his way.
Have you found anything?

687
00:47:55,980 --> 00:47:58,499
No. Did he take the cigarette?
Yes. Shit!

688
00:47:58,500 --> 00:48:01,739
He's coming, ten minutes.
There's nothing in the bedroom.

689
00:48:01,740 --> 00:48:05,379
It looks like he's clean,
we've tried all the usual places.

690
00:48:05,380 --> 00:48:07,699
Are you sure tonight's
a danger night?

691
00:48:07,700 --> 00:48:11,339
No, but then I never am.
You have to stay with him, John.

692
00:48:11,340 --> 00:48:13,019
I've got plans.

693
00:48:13,020 --> 00:48:14,340
No.

694
00:48:16,700 --> 00:48:18,740
Mycroft?

695
00:48:26,660 --> 00:48:28,779
I am really sorry.

696
00:48:28,780 --> 00:48:31,219
You know my friends are
so wrong about you?

697
00:48:31,220 --> 00:48:35,339
You're a great boyfriend.
OK, that's good.

698
00:48:35,340 --> 00:48:39,539
I always thought I was great.
Sherlock Holmes is a very lucky man.

699
00:48:39,540 --> 00:48:41,179
Jeanette, please.

700
00:48:41,180 --> 00:48:44,699
No, I mean it. It's heart-warming.
You'll do anything for him.

701
00:48:44,700 --> 00:48:47,379
And he can't even tell
your girlfriends apart!

702
00:48:47,380 --> 00:48:50,459
I'll do anything for you, just tell
me what it is I'm not doing.

703
00:48:50,460 --> 00:48:53,099
Don't make me compete
with Sherlock Holmes!

704
00:48:53,100 --> 00:48:56,459
I'll walk your dog. There, I've said
it, I'll even walk your dog.

705
00:48:56,460 --> 00:49:00,659
I don't have a dog!
No, because that was the last one.

706
00:49:00,660 --> 00:49:05,579
OK. Jesus! I'll call you. No! OK.

707
00:49:05,580 --> 00:49:08,100
That really wasn't very good,
was it?

708
00:49:20,780 --> 00:49:22,420
Hi.

709
00:49:25,220 --> 00:49:26,260
You OK?

710
00:49:32,540 --> 00:49:35,460
I hope you didn't mess up
my sock index this time!

711
00:50:01,860 --> 00:50:05,659
Lovely tune, Sherlock,
haven't heard that one before.

712
00:50:05,660 --> 00:50:09,219
Composing?

713
00:50:09,220 --> 00:50:10,460
Helps me to think.

714
00:50:17,500 --> 00:50:20,219
What are you thinking about?

715
00:50:20,220 --> 00:50:24,259
The count on your blog
is still stuck at 1895.

716
00:50:24,260 --> 00:50:27,499
Yes.
Faulty, can't seem to fix it.

717
00:50:27,500 --> 00:50:30,259
Faulty, or you've been hacked
and it's a message.

718
00:50:39,060 --> 00:50:40,939
Just faulty.

719
00:50:40,940 --> 00:50:43,700
Right.

720
00:50:45,940 --> 00:50:47,019
Right.

721
00:50:47,020 --> 00:50:51,260
Well, I'm going out for a bit.

722
00:50:59,860 --> 00:51:04,059
Listen, has he ever had any
kind of girlfriend,

723
00:51:04,060 --> 00:51:08,179
boyfriend, a relationship, ever?

724
00:51:08,180 --> 00:51:09,819
I don't know.

725
00:51:09,820 --> 00:51:11,179
How can we not know?

726
00:51:11,180 --> 00:51:12,499
He's Sherlock.

727
00:51:12,500 --> 00:51:16,059
How will we ever know what goes
on in that funny old head?

728
00:51:16,060 --> 00:51:18,900
Right. See you.

729
00:51:32,860 --> 00:51:34,940
John? Yeah? Hello?

730
00:51:38,300 --> 00:51:41,139
Hello.
So, any plans for new year tonight?

731
00:51:41,140 --> 00:51:45,540
Nothing fixed.

732
00:51:47,660 --> 00:51:51,139
Nothing I couldn't
heartlessly abandon.

733
00:51:51,140 --> 00:51:54,420
You have any ideas? One.

734
00:51:57,820 --> 00:51:59,899
You know,
Mycroft could just phone me,

735
00:51:59,900 --> 00:52:03,380
if he didn't have this
bloody stupid power complex.

736
00:52:30,820 --> 00:52:33,419
Couldn't we just go to a cafe?

737
00:52:33,420 --> 00:52:35,540
Sherlock doesn't
follow me everywhere.

738
00:52:37,420 --> 00:52:40,180
Through there.

739
00:52:48,220 --> 00:52:49,619
He's on his way.

740
00:52:49,620 --> 00:52:52,500
You were right,
he thinks it's Mycroft.

741
00:52:57,300 --> 00:52:58,940
He's writing sad music.

742
00:53:00,780 --> 00:53:04,139
Doesn't eat, barely talks,

743
00:53:04,140 --> 00:53:09,339
only to correct the television.

744
00:53:09,340 --> 00:53:13,339
I'd say he was heart-broken,
but, well he's Sherlock.

745
00:53:13,340 --> 00:53:15,580
He does all that anyway.

746
00:53:19,420 --> 00:53:21,060
Hello, Dr Watson.

747
00:53:29,940 --> 00:53:31,180
Tell him you're alive.

748
00:53:31,181 --> 00:53:32,979
He'd come after me.

749
00:53:32,980 --> 00:53:36,779
I'll come after you if you don't.

750
00:53:36,780 --> 00:53:38,619
I believe you.

751
00:53:38,620 --> 00:53:41,859
You were dead on a slab.

752
00:53:41,860 --> 00:53:43,659
It was definitely you.

753
00:53:43,660 --> 00:53:46,659
DNA tests are only as good
as the records you keep.

754
00:53:46,660 --> 00:53:49,499
And I bet you know the record keeper.
I know what he likes.

755
00:53:49,500 --> 00:53:51,419
And I needed to disappear.

756
00:53:51,420 --> 00:53:55,339
Then how come I can see you
and I don't even want to?

757
00:53:55,340 --> 00:53:56,779
Look, I made a mistake,

758
00:53:56,780 --> 00:54:01,219
I sent something to Sherlock for
safekeeping, now I need it back.

759
00:54:01,220 --> 00:54:03,739
I need your help. No.
It's for his own safety.

760
00:54:03,740 --> 00:54:07,099
So is this.
Tell him you're alive.

761
00:54:07,100 --> 00:54:11,259
I can't. Fine, I'll tell him

762
00:54:11,260 --> 00:54:16,139
and I still won't help you.
What do I say?

763
00:54:16,140 --> 00:54:20,059
What do you normally say?!
You've texted him a lot!

764
00:54:20,060 --> 00:54:24,339
Just the usual stuff.
There is no usual in this case.

765
00:54:24,340 --> 00:54:28,379
"Good morning.
I like your funny hat.

766
00:54:28,380 --> 00:54:30,300
"I'm sad tonight, let's have dinner.

767
00:54:30,301 --> 00:54:34,139
" You look sexy on Crimewatch,
let's have dinner.

768
00:54:34,140 --> 00:54:36,299
"I'm not hungry.

769
00:54:36,300 --> 00:54:40,179
"Let's have dinner".

770
00:54:40,180 --> 00:54:44,019
You flirted with Sherlock Holmes?
At him. He never replies.

771
00:54:44,020 --> 00:54:46,379
No, Sherlock always replies
to everything.

772
00:54:46,380 --> 00:54:48,499
He's Mr Punchline.

773
00:54:48,500 --> 00:54:51,219
He will outlive God trying
to have the last word.

774
00:54:51,220 --> 00:54:53,339
Does that make me special?

775
00:54:53,340 --> 00:54:57,299
I don't know, maybe.
Are you jealous?

776
00:54:57,300 --> 00:55:01,019
We're not a couple.
Yes, you are.

777
00:55:01,020 --> 00:55:04,579
There, "I'm not dead."

778
00:55:04,580 --> 00:55:07,819
"Let's have dinner".

779
00:55:07,820 --> 00:55:11,979
Who the hell knows about
Sherlock Holmes? But for the record,

780
00:55:11,980 --> 00:55:15,739
if anyone out there still cares,
I'm not actually gay.

781
00:55:15,740 --> 00:55:20,540
Well, I am. Look at us both.

782
00:55:34,940 --> 00:55:38,820
I don't think so, do you?

783
00:56:42,140 --> 00:56:44,260
Stop it! Stop it!

784
00:56:45,980 --> 00:56:48,500
Sherlock!

785
00:57:06,700 --> 00:57:10,499
Sherlock, Sherlock...
Don't snivel, Mrs Hudson,

786
00:57:10,500 --> 00:57:13,660
it'll do nothing to impede
the flight of a bullet.

787
00:57:15,180 --> 00:57:17,179
What a tender world that would be.

788
00:57:17,180 --> 00:57:18,739
Please, Sherlock...

789
00:57:18,740 --> 00:57:22,099
I believe that you have
something that we want, Mr Holmes.

790
00:57:22,100 --> 00:57:24,180
Then why don't you ask for it?

791
00:57:28,140 --> 00:57:32,459
I've been asking this one,
she doesn't seem to know anything.

792
00:57:32,460 --> 00:57:36,340
But you know what I'm asking for,
don't you, Mr Holmes?

793
00:57:44,220 --> 00:57:46,700
I believe I do.

794
00:57:48,980 --> 00:57:50,660
Please, help.

795
00:57:51,660 --> 00:57:53,299
First get rid of your boys.

796
00:57:53,300 --> 00:57:55,219
Why? I dislike being outnumbered,

797
00:57:55,220 --> 00:57:57,540
it makes for too much
stupid in the room.

798
00:57:58,820 --> 00:58:02,179
You two, go to the car.
Then get into the car and drive away.

799
00:58:02,180 --> 00:58:05,580
Don't try to trick me,
you know who I am, it doesn't work.

800
00:58:10,740 --> 00:58:13,659
Next, you can stop pointing
that gun at me.

801
00:58:13,660 --> 00:58:15,499
So you can point a gun at me?

802
00:58:15,500 --> 00:58:16,619
I'm unarmed.

803
00:58:16,620 --> 00:58:18,980
Mind if I check? I insist.

804
00:58:31,260 --> 00:58:33,900
Moron.

805
00:58:35,900 --> 00:58:38,700
Thank you. You're all right now,
you're all right.

806
00:59:07,460 --> 00:59:09,420
Jeez, what the
hell is happening?

807
00:59:09,421 --> 00:59:11,379
Mrs Hudson has been
attacked by an American,

808
00:59:11,380 --> 00:59:13,539
I'm restoring balance
to the universe.

809
00:59:13,540 --> 00:59:16,099
Mrs Hudson, my God,
are you all right?

810
00:59:16,100 --> 00:59:18,179
Jesus, what have they done to you?

811
00:59:18,180 --> 00:59:19,939
I'm just being so silly.

812
00:59:19,940 --> 00:59:22,579
Take her downstairs
and look after her.

813
00:59:22,580 --> 00:59:26,939
It's all right,
I'll have a look at that.

814
00:59:26,940 --> 00:59:28,260
I'm fine, I'm fine.

815
00:59:29,420 --> 00:59:32,500
Are you going to tell me
what's going on? I expect so, now go.

816
00:59:35,780 --> 00:59:37,299
Lestrade?

817
00:59:37,300 --> 00:59:40,139
We've had a break-in
at Baker Street.

818
00:59:40,140 --> 00:59:43,579
Send your least irritating officers
and an ambulance.

819
00:59:43,580 --> 00:59:45,699
No, no, no, we're fine.

820
00:59:45,700 --> 00:59:50,020
No, it's the burglar, he's
got himself rather badly injured.

821
00:59:51,300 --> 00:59:55,700
A few broken ribs, fractured
skull, suspected punctured lung...

822
00:59:57,660 --> 00:59:59,220
He fell out of a window.

823
01:00:00,340 --> 01:00:02,460
It stings.

824
01:00:08,580 --> 01:00:11,059
That was right on my bins.

825
01:00:14,980 --> 01:00:18,779
And exactly how many times
did he fall out the window?

826
01:00:18,780 --> 01:00:22,179
It's all a bit of a blur,
Detective Inspector.

827
01:00:22,180 --> 01:00:23,900
I lost count.

828
01:00:29,500 --> 01:00:32,379
She'll have to sleep
upstairs in our flat tonight,

829
01:00:32,380 --> 01:00:33,780
we need to look after her.

830
01:00:33,781 --> 01:00:36,379
No... She's fine.
No, she's not, look at her.

831
01:00:36,380 --> 01:00:39,019
She's got to take some time
away from Baker Street.

832
01:00:39,020 --> 01:00:41,739
She can stay with her sister,
doctor's orders.

833
01:00:41,740 --> 01:00:44,179
Don't be absurd.
She's in shock, for God's sake,

834
01:00:44,180 --> 01:00:47,299
and all over some stupid
camera-phone... where is it anyway?

835
01:00:47,300 --> 01:00:49,619
Safest place I know.

836
01:00:49,620 --> 01:00:53,739
You left it in the pocket of your
second best dressing gown, you clot!

837
01:00:53,740 --> 01:00:58,619
I managed to sneak it out when
they thought I was having a cry.

838
01:00:58,620 --> 01:01:00,339
Thank you.

839
01:01:00,340 --> 01:01:02,139
Shame on you, John Watson.

840
01:01:02,140 --> 01:01:05,299
Shame on me?
Mrs Hudson leave Baker Street?

841
01:01:05,300 --> 01:01:07,140
England would fall.

842
01:01:19,460 --> 01:01:21,819
Where is it now?

843
01:01:21,820 --> 01:01:24,179
Where no-one will look.

844
01:01:24,180 --> 01:01:28,259
Whatever's on that phone
is more than just pictures.

845
01:01:28,260 --> 01:01:29,900
Yes, it is.

846
01:01:32,740 --> 01:01:34,540
So, she's alive then.

847
01:01:36,340 --> 01:01:38,220
How are we feeling about that?

848
01:01:42,300 --> 01:01:43,699
Happy New Year, John.

849
01:01:43,700 --> 01:01:46,660
Do you think you'll be
seeing her again?

850
01:02:26,980 --> 01:02:29,699
Is that a phone?
It's a camera-phone.

851
01:02:29,700 --> 01:02:32,539
And you're x-raying it?
Yes, I am.

852
01:02:32,540 --> 01:02:34,299
Whose phone is it? A woman's.

853
01:02:34,300 --> 01:02:35,739
Your girlfriend?

854
01:02:35,740 --> 01:02:39,179
She's my girlfriend because
I'm x-raying her possessions?

855
01:02:39,180 --> 01:02:41,300
Well, we all do silly things! Yes...

856
01:02:43,260 --> 01:02:45,899
they do, don't they?

857
01:02:45,900 --> 01:02:48,020
Very silly.

858
01:02:52,180 --> 01:02:54,219
She sent this to my address.

859
01:02:54,220 --> 01:02:57,620
She loves to play games. She does?

860
01:03:44,660 --> 01:03:46,539
Hey, Sherlock...

861
01:03:46,540 --> 01:03:48,219
We have a client.

862
01:03:48,220 --> 01:03:50,060
What, in your bedroom?

863
01:03:57,660 --> 01:03:59,619
So, who's after you?

864
01:03:59,620 --> 01:04:01,699
People who want to kill me.
Who's that?

865
01:04:01,700 --> 01:04:03,619
Killers.

866
01:04:03,620 --> 01:04:06,020
It would help if you were
a tiny bit more specific.

867
01:04:06,021 --> 01:04:07,800
So you faked your own death
to get ahead of them?

868
01:04:07,801 --> 01:04:09,579
It worked for a while.

869
01:04:09,580 --> 01:04:11,700
Except you let John know
you're alive, therefore me.

870
01:04:11,701 --> 01:04:13,819
I knew you'd keep my secret.

871
01:04:13,820 --> 01:04:15,219
You couldn't.

872
01:04:15,220 --> 01:04:16,860
But you did, didn't you?

873
01:04:18,020 --> 01:04:19,819
Where's my camera-phone?

874
01:04:19,820 --> 01:04:21,219
It's not here.

875
01:04:21,220 --> 01:04:22,659
We're not stupid.

876
01:04:22,660 --> 01:04:24,520
What have you done with it?

877
01:04:24,521 --> 01:04:26,379
If they've guessed,
they'll be watching you.

878
01:04:26,380 --> 01:04:28,699
Then they'll know I took
a safety deposit box

879
01:04:28,700 --> 01:04:30,779
at a bank on the Strand
a few months ago.

880
01:04:30,780 --> 01:04:32,859
I need it.

881
01:04:32,860 --> 01:04:35,220
Well, we can't just go
and get it, can we?

882
01:04:36,460 --> 01:04:40,619
Molly Hooper, she could collect it,
take it to Barts.

883
01:04:40,620 --> 01:04:44,819
Then one of your homeless network could
bring it here, leave it in the cafe,

884
01:04:44,820 --> 01:04:47,379
one of the boys downstairs
could bring it up the back.

885
01:04:47,380 --> 01:04:50,939
Very good, John, excellent plan,
full of intelligent precautions.

886
01:04:50,940 --> 01:04:53,820
Thank you.
So, why don't I phone...

887
01:04:54,900 --> 01:04:58,459
So, what do you keep on here?

888
01:04:58,460 --> 01:05:00,259
In general, I mean?

889
01:05:00,260 --> 01:05:03,379
Pictures, information,
anything I might find useful.

890
01:05:03,380 --> 01:05:05,660
For blackmail? For protection.

891
01:05:06,660 --> 01:05:08,739
I make my way in the world,
I misbehave.

892
01:05:08,740 --> 01:05:13,139
I like to know people will be on my
side exactly when I need them to be.

893
01:05:13,140 --> 01:05:17,099
So how do you acquire this information?
I told you I misbehave.

894
01:05:17,100 --> 01:05:19,540
But you've acquired something
more danger than protection.

895
01:05:19,541 --> 01:05:21,979
Do you know what it is? Yes...

896
01:05:21,980 --> 01:05:23,619
but I don't understand it.

897
01:05:23,620 --> 01:05:25,340
I assumed. Show me.

898
01:05:27,500 --> 01:05:28,860
The passcode.

899
01:05:41,900 --> 01:05:43,459
It's not working.

900
01:05:43,460 --> 01:05:45,899
No, because it's
a duplicate I had made

901
01:05:45,900 --> 01:05:48,339
into which you just
entered the numbers 1058.

902
01:05:48,340 --> 01:05:53,500
I assumed you'd choose something more
specific than that, but thanks, anyway.

903
01:06:02,820 --> 01:06:05,899
I told you that
camera-phone was my life.

904
01:06:05,900 --> 01:06:07,579
I know when it's in my hand.

905
01:06:07,580 --> 01:06:09,939
You're rather good.

906
01:06:09,940 --> 01:06:11,940
You're not so bad.

907
01:06:15,420 --> 01:06:17,180
Hamish.

908
01:06:18,420 --> 01:06:23,460
John Hamish Watson, just
if you were looking for baby names.

909
01:06:25,020 --> 01:06:29,340
There was a man, an MOD official
and I knew what he liked.

910
01:06:30,620 --> 01:06:33,099
One of the things
he liked was showing off.

911
01:06:33,100 --> 01:06:35,619
He told me this email was going
to save the world.

912
01:06:35,620 --> 01:06:39,499
He didn't know but I photographed it
... he was a bit tied up at the time.

913
01:06:39,500 --> 01:06:42,619
It's a bit small on that screen,
can you read it?

914
01:06:42,620 --> 01:06:44,899
Yes. Code, obviously.

915
01:06:44,900 --> 01:06:48,059
I had one of the country's
best cryptographers take a look,

916
01:06:48,060 --> 01:06:50,859
though he was mostly upside down,
as I recall.

917
01:06:50,860 --> 01:06:53,020
Couldn't figure it out.

918
01:06:54,940 --> 01:06:56,420
What can you do, Mr Holmes?

919
01:06:56,421 --> 01:06:59,620
Go on, impress a girl.

920
01:07:15,700 --> 01:07:17,339
There's a margin for error,

921
01:07:17,340 --> 01:07:19,400
but I'm pretty sure
there's a 747 leaving

922
01:07:19,401 --> 01:07:21,459
Heathrow tomorrow at
6.30 for Baltimore.

923
01:07:21,460 --> 01:07:24,259
Apparently it's going to
save the world, I'm not sure how,

924
01:07:24,260 --> 01:07:27,660
but give me a moment, I've only
been on the case eight seconds.

925
01:07:28,780 --> 01:07:32,139
Come on, it's not code,
these are seats on a jet.

926
01:07:32,140 --> 01:07:34,459
Look, no 'I' because
it can be mistaken for one.

927
01:07:34,460 --> 01:07:37,219
No letters past 'K'
the width of the plane is the limit.

928
01:07:37,220 --> 01:07:39,499
The numbers always appear
not in sequence,

929
01:07:39,500 --> 01:07:41,600
but the letters have
little runs of sequence

930
01:07:41,601 --> 01:07:43,699
families and couples
sitting together.

931
01:07:43,700 --> 01:07:45,880
Only a Jumbo's wide enough
for a letter 'K' or

932
01:07:45,881 --> 01:07:48,059
rows past 55, so there's
always an upstairs.

933
01:07:48,060 --> 01:07:50,339
A row 13 eliminates
superstitious airlines.

934
01:07:50,340 --> 01:07:53,579
The style of the flight number,
'007', eliminates a few more.

935
01:07:53,580 --> 01:07:57,419
Assuming a British point of origin
because of the original source,

936
01:07:57,420 --> 01:08:00,659
and assuming the crisis is imminent,
the only flight that matches

937
01:08:00,660 --> 01:08:03,200
all the criteria and
departs within the week is

938
01:08:03,201 --> 01:08:05,740
the 6.30 to Baltimore
tomorrow from Heathrow.

939
01:08:07,380 --> 01:08:10,819
Please don't feel obliged to tell me
that was amazing,

940
01:08:10,820 --> 01:08:14,419
John's expressed that in every
possible variant available in English.

941
01:08:14,420 --> 01:08:16,899
I would have you right here,
on this desk,

942
01:08:16,900 --> 01:08:19,100
until you begged for mercy twice.

943
01:08:22,700 --> 01:08:25,860
John, can you check those
flight schedules, see if I'm right?

944
01:08:27,740 --> 01:08:29,779
I'm on it, yeah.

945
01:08:29,780 --> 01:08:31,979
I've never begged for mercy
in my life.

946
01:08:31,980 --> 01:08:33,619
Twice.

947
01:08:33,620 --> 01:08:36,819
Yeah, you're right,
flight double 'o' seven.

948
01:08:36,820 --> 01:08:39,219
What did you say? You're right.

949
01:08:39,220 --> 01:08:41,259
No, what did you say after that?

950
01:08:41,260 --> 01:08:43,979
Double 'o' seven,
flight double 'o' seven.

951
01:08:43,980 --> 01:08:45,940
Double 'o' seven,
double 'o' seven...

952
01:08:45,941 --> 01:08:47,779
Something, double 'o' seven...

953
01:08:47,780 --> 01:08:49,340
What?

954
01:09:06,660 --> 01:09:09,739
Double 'o' seven,
double 'o' seven, what?

955
01:09:09,740 --> 01:09:11,380
What, something, what?!

956
01:09:13,900 --> 01:09:16,219
Bond Air is go.

957
01:09:16,220 --> 01:09:17,620
Bond Air is go.

958
01:09:18,900 --> 01:09:22,500
Bond Air is go.

959
01:10:22,180 --> 01:10:25,899
'Bond Air is go, that's decided.

960
01:10:25,900 --> 01:10:28,020
'Check with the Coventry lot.'

961
01:10:32,540 --> 01:10:34,860
Coventry. I've never been.

962
01:10:36,140 --> 01:10:38,419
Is it nice?

963
01:10:38,420 --> 01:10:40,179
Where's John?

964
01:10:40,180 --> 01:10:42,499
He went out, a couple of hours ago.

965
01:10:42,500 --> 01:10:44,539
I was just talking to him.

966
01:10:44,540 --> 01:10:46,219
He said you do that.

967
01:10:46,220 --> 01:10:48,940
What's Coventry got to do
with anything?

968
01:10:50,780 --> 01:10:53,579
It's a story, probably not true

969
01:10:53,580 --> 01:10:55,920
in the Second World
War, the Allies knew

970
01:10:55,921 --> 01:10:58,259
Coventry was going to
get bombed, because

971
01:10:58,260 --> 01:11:01,859
they'd broken the German code, but
didn't want the Germans to know that,

972
01:11:01,860 --> 01:11:05,500
so they let it happen anyway.
Have you ever had anyone?

973
01:11:07,300 --> 01:11:08,899
I'm sorry?

974
01:11:08,900 --> 01:11:11,739
And when I say had,
I'm being indelicate.

975
01:11:11,740 --> 01:11:14,220
I don't understand.
I'll be delicate then.

976
01:11:18,980 --> 01:11:20,539
Let's have dinner. Why?

977
01:11:20,540 --> 01:11:23,059
You might be hungry.
I'm not. Good.

978
01:11:23,060 --> 01:11:29,899
Why would I... want to have dinner...

979
01:11:29,900 --> 01:11:31,899
if I wasn't hungry?

980
01:11:31,900 --> 01:11:35,939
Mr Holmes,
if it was the end of the world,

981
01:11:35,940 --> 01:11:38,260
if this was the very last night...

982
01:11:40,540 --> 01:11:43,139
would you have dinner with me?

983
01:11:43,140 --> 01:11:44,499
Sherlock?

984
01:11:44,500 --> 01:11:46,579
Too late.

985
01:11:46,580 --> 01:11:51,179
That's not the end of the world,
that's Mrs Hudson.

986
01:11:51,180 --> 01:11:55,099
Sherlock, this man was at the door,
is the bell still not working?

987
01:11:55,100 --> 01:11:56,459
He shot it.

988
01:11:56,460 --> 01:11:58,619
Have you come to take me away again?

989
01:11:58,620 --> 01:12:00,459
Yes, Mr Holmes. Well, I decline.

990
01:12:00,460 --> 01:12:02,860
I don't think you do.

991
01:12:31,100 --> 01:12:33,579
There's going to be a bomb
on a passenger jet.

992
01:12:33,580 --> 01:12:36,019
The British and Americans
know about it,

993
01:12:36,020 --> 01:12:38,740
but rather than expose
their source they're going

994
01:12:38,741 --> 01:12:41,459
to let it happen
the plane will blow up.

995
01:12:41,460 --> 01:12:44,059
Coventry all over again.

996
01:12:44,060 --> 01:12:47,140
The wheel turns,
nothing is ever new.

997
01:13:20,900 --> 01:13:25,139
Well, you're looking all better.

998
01:13:25,140 --> 01:13:27,979
How you feeling?

999
01:13:27,980 --> 01:13:30,379
Like putting a bullet in your brain,
sir.

1000
01:13:33,540 --> 01:13:36,419
They'd pin a medal on me if I did...

1001
01:13:36,420 --> 01:13:37,780
sir.

1002
01:14:16,540 --> 01:14:18,979
The Coventry conundrum.

1003
01:14:18,980 --> 01:14:21,260
What do you think of my solution?

1004
01:14:23,420 --> 01:14:25,500
The flight of the dead.

1005
01:14:27,460 --> 01:14:30,979
Plane blows up midair, mission
accomplished for the terrorists,

1006
01:14:30,980 --> 01:14:33,579
hundreds of casualties,
but nobody dies.

1007
01:14:33,580 --> 01:14:35,779
Neat, don't you think?

1008
01:14:35,780 --> 01:14:39,579
You've been stumbling around
the fringes of this one for ages.

1009
01:14:39,580 --> 01:14:43,339
Or were you too bored
to notice the pattern?

1010
01:14:43,340 --> 01:14:46,139
They wouldn't let us see Granddad
when he was dead.

1011
01:14:46,140 --> 01:14:50,059
She's not my real aunt
I know human ash.

1012
01:14:50,060 --> 01:14:53,619
We ran a similar project with
the Germans a while back,

1013
01:14:53,620 --> 01:14:57,260
though I believe one of our
passengers didn't make the flight.

1014
01:14:59,180 --> 01:15:01,779
But that's the deceased for you...

1015
01:15:01,780 --> 01:15:05,139
late, in every sense of the word.

1016
01:15:05,140 --> 01:15:06,779
How is the plane going to fly?

1017
01:15:06,780 --> 01:15:09,819
Of course, unmanned aircraft,
hardly new.

1018
01:15:09,820 --> 01:15:11,539
It doesn't fly.

1019
01:15:11,540 --> 01:15:13,139
It will never fly.

1020
01:15:13,140 --> 01:15:15,299
This entire project is cancelled.

1021
01:15:15,300 --> 01:15:19,499
The terrorist cells have been
informed we know about the bomb.

1022
01:15:19,500 --> 01:15:21,220
We can't fool them now.

1023
01:15:22,700 --> 01:15:24,739
We've lost everything.

1024
01:15:24,740 --> 01:15:27,459
One fragment of one email,

1025
01:15:27,460 --> 01:15:31,860
and months and years of planning
finished.

1026
01:15:33,060 --> 01:15:36,339
Your MOD man.
That's all it takes.

1027
01:15:36,340 --> 01:15:39,579
One lonely, naive man,
desperate to show off,

1028
01:15:39,580 --> 01:15:43,260
and a woman clever enough
to make him feel special.

1029
01:15:44,860 --> 01:15:47,619
You should screen your
defence people more carefully.

1030
01:15:47,620 --> 01:15:51,780
I'm not talking about the MOD man,
Sherlock, I'm talking about you!

1031
01:15:54,420 --> 01:15:56,180
The damsel in distress.

1032
01:15:58,100 --> 01:16:01,779
In the end,
are you really so obvious?

1033
01:16:01,780 --> 01:16:03,660
Because this was textbook.

1034
01:16:05,260 --> 01:16:09,460
The promise of love, the pain
of loss, the joy of redemption.

1035
01:16:11,140 --> 01:16:14,380
Then give him a puzzle
and watch him dance.

1036
01:16:15,820 --> 01:16:17,259
Don't be absurd!

1037
01:16:17,260 --> 01:16:18,699
Absurd?

1038
01:16:18,700 --> 01:16:22,379
How quickly did you decipher
that email for her?

1039
01:16:22,380 --> 01:16:24,099
Was it the full minute?

1040
01:16:24,100 --> 01:16:26,899
Or were you really eager to impress?

1041
01:16:26,900 --> 01:16:29,420
I think it was less than
five seconds.

1042
01:16:30,540 --> 01:16:32,340
I drove you into her path.

1043
01:16:34,860 --> 01:16:37,899
I'm sorry, I didn't know.

1044
01:16:37,900 --> 01:16:40,179
Mr Holmes, I think we need to talk.

1045
01:16:40,180 --> 01:16:44,339
So do I, there are a number of
aspects I'm still not clear on.

1046
01:16:44,340 --> 01:16:46,100
Not you, Junior, you're done now.

1047
01:16:47,500 --> 01:16:49,579
There's more, loads more.

1048
01:16:49,580 --> 01:16:52,219
On this phone I've got secrets,
pictures

1049
01:16:52,220 --> 01:16:55,099
and scandals that could
topple your whole world.

1050
01:16:55,100 --> 01:16:59,579
You have no idea how much havoc I can
cause and exactly one way to stop me.

1051
01:16:59,580 --> 01:17:01,659
Unless you want to tell
your masters

1052
01:17:01,660 --> 01:17:04,940
that your biggest security leak
is your own little brother.

1053
01:17:12,860 --> 01:17:15,579
We have people
who can get into this.

1054
01:17:15,580 --> 01:17:18,419
I tested that theory for you.

1055
01:17:18,420 --> 01:17:21,179
I let Sherlock Holmes
try it for six months.

1056
01:17:21,180 --> 01:17:24,739
Sherlock, dear, tell him what you
found when you x-rayed my phone.

1057
01:17:24,740 --> 01:17:27,579
Four additional units
wired inside the casing,

1058
01:17:27,580 --> 01:17:30,499
I suspect containing acid
or a small explosive.

1059
01:17:30,500 --> 01:17:33,099
Any attempt to open it
will burn the hard drive.

1060
01:17:33,100 --> 01:17:34,219
Explosive.

1061
01:17:34,220 --> 01:17:36,219
It's more me.

1062
01:17:36,220 --> 01:17:38,779
Some data is always recoverable.

1063
01:17:38,780 --> 01:17:40,060
Take that risk.

1064
01:17:40,061 --> 01:17:42,019
You have a passcode to open this.

1065
01:17:42,020 --> 01:17:45,859
I deeply regret to say, we have
people who can extract it from you.

1066
01:17:45,860 --> 01:17:47,979
Sherlock? There will be
two passcodes

1067
01:17:47,980 --> 01:17:51,179
one to open the phone,
one to burn the drive.

1068
01:17:51,180 --> 01:17:54,059
Even under duress, you can't know
which one she's given

1069
01:17:54,060 --> 01:17:57,219
and there would be no second
attempt. He's good, isn't he?

1070
01:17:57,220 --> 01:17:58,899
I should have him on a leash.

1071
01:17:58,900 --> 01:18:01,099
In fact, I might.

1072
01:18:01,100 --> 01:18:04,739
We destroy this, then.
No-one has the information.

1073
01:18:04,740 --> 01:18:06,259
Fine, good idea.

1074
01:18:06,260 --> 01:18:09,019
Unless there are lives
of British citizens

1075
01:18:09,020 --> 01:18:11,219
depending on the information
you burn.

1076
01:18:11,220 --> 01:18:15,139
Are there?
Telling you would be playing fair.

1077
01:18:15,140 --> 01:18:17,340
I'm not playing any more.

1078
01:18:20,340 --> 01:18:22,379
A list of my requests,

1079
01:18:22,380 --> 01:18:26,260
and some ideas about my protection
once they're granted.

1080
01:18:27,980 --> 01:18:30,380
I'd say it wouldn't blow
much of a hole in the

1081
01:18:30,381 --> 01:18:32,780
wealth of a nation, but
then I'd be lying.

1082
01:18:36,140 --> 01:18:39,779
I imagine you'd like to sleep on it.
Thank you, yes.

1083
01:18:39,780 --> 01:18:41,180
Too bad.

1084
01:18:42,420 --> 01:18:44,580
Off you pop and talk to people.

1085
01:18:48,540 --> 01:18:51,020
You've been very... thorough.

1086
01:18:52,380 --> 01:18:54,979
I wish our lot were
half as good as you.

1087
01:18:54,980 --> 01:18:58,860
I can't take all the credit,
I had a bit of help.

1088
01:19:00,100 --> 01:19:02,499
Jim Moriarty sends his love.

1089
01:19:02,500 --> 01:19:04,259
Yes, he's been in touch.

1090
01:19:04,260 --> 01:19:07,899
Seems desperate for my attention,

1091
01:19:07,900 --> 01:19:10,179
which I'm sure can be arranged.

1092
01:19:10,180 --> 01:19:13,539
I had all this stuff and
never knew what to do with it.

1093
01:19:13,540 --> 01:19:16,659
Thank God for
the consultant criminal.

1094
01:19:16,660 --> 01:19:20,539
Gave me a lot of advice about how
to play the Holmes boys.

1095
01:19:20,540 --> 01:19:22,539
Do you know what he calls you?

1096
01:19:22,540 --> 01:19:24,779
The Ice Man...

1097
01:19:24,780 --> 01:19:26,220
and the Virgin.

1098
01:19:27,380 --> 01:19:30,819
Didn't even ask for anything,
he just likes to cause trouble

1099
01:19:30,820 --> 01:19:32,219
that's my kind of man.

1100
01:19:32,220 --> 01:19:34,059
And here you are,

1101
01:19:34,060 --> 01:19:39,259
the dominatrix who brought
a nation to its knees.

1102
01:19:39,260 --> 01:19:41,379
Nicely played.

1103
01:19:41,380 --> 01:19:42,940
No.

1104
01:19:44,140 --> 01:19:45,420
Sorry?

1105
01:19:47,820 --> 01:19:49,219
I said no.

1106
01:19:49,220 --> 01:19:51,739
Very, very close, but no.

1107
01:19:51,740 --> 01:19:53,579
You got carried away.

1108
01:19:53,580 --> 01:19:57,259
The game was too elaborate,
you were enjoying yourself too much.

1109
01:19:57,260 --> 01:19:59,099
There's no such thing as too much.

1110
01:19:59,100 --> 01:20:01,499
Enjoying the thrill
of the chase is fine.

1111
01:20:01,500 --> 01:20:04,779
Craving the distraction of the game,
I sympathise, but sentiment?

1112
01:20:04,780 --> 01:20:08,499
Sentiment is a chemical defect
found in the losing side.

1113
01:20:08,500 --> 01:20:11,259
Sentiment?
What are you talking about?

1114
01:20:11,260 --> 01:20:12,740
You.

1115
01:20:14,180 --> 01:20:16,499
Dear God.

1116
01:20:16,500 --> 01:20:17,900
Look at the poor man.

1117
01:20:19,060 --> 01:20:21,979
You don't actually think
I was interested in you?

1118
01:20:21,980 --> 01:20:23,699
Why?

1119
01:20:23,700 --> 01:20:26,059
Because you're the great
Sherlock Holmes,

1120
01:20:26,060 --> 01:20:28,259
the clever detective
in the funny hat?

1121
01:20:28,260 --> 01:20:30,700
No.

1122
01:20:36,060 --> 01:20:38,380
Because I took your pulse.

1123
01:20:48,420 --> 01:20:49,939
Elevated.

1124
01:20:49,940 --> 01:20:51,860
Your pupils dilated.

1125
01:20:55,820 --> 01:20:58,739
I imagine John Watson thinks
love's a mystery to me,

1126
01:20:58,740 --> 01:21:03,619
but the chemistry is incredibly
simple and very destructive.

1127
01:21:03,620 --> 01:21:05,940
When we first met, you
told me that disguise

1128
01:21:05,941 --> 01:21:08,259
is always a self-portrait
- How true of you.

1129
01:21:08,260 --> 01:21:10,698
The combination to your safe,
your measurements

1130
01:21:10,699 --> 01:21:12,660
but this,
this is far more intimate,

1131
01:21:12,661 --> 01:21:16,579
this is your heart and you should
never let it rule your head.

1132
01:21:16,580 --> 01:21:20,019
You could have chosen any number
and walked out with everything.

1133
01:21:20,020 --> 01:21:22,779
But you just couldn't resist it,
could you?

1134
01:21:22,780 --> 01:21:27,739
I've always assumed that love
is a dangerous disadvantage.

1135
01:21:27,740 --> 01:21:29,700
Thank you for the final proof.

1136
01:21:31,460 --> 01:21:34,540
Everything I said, it's not real.

1137
01:21:36,220 --> 01:21:38,179
I was just playing the game.

1138
01:21:38,180 --> 01:21:40,779
I know.

1139
01:21:40,780 --> 01:21:42,740
And this is just losing.

1140
01:21:51,580 --> 01:21:53,739
There you are, Brother,

1141
01:21:53,740 --> 01:21:57,099
hope the contents make up for any
inconvenience caused tonight.

1142
01:21:57,100 --> 01:22:00,219
I'm certain they will.
If you're feeling kind, lock her up,

1143
01:22:00,220 --> 01:22:02,539
let her go and I doubt
she'll survive long.

1144
01:22:02,540 --> 01:22:05,300
Are you expecting me to beg?
Yes.

1145
01:22:09,740 --> 01:22:11,340
Please.

1146
01:22:13,500 --> 01:22:15,220
You're right.

1147
01:22:16,220 --> 01:22:18,460
I won't even last six months.

1148
01:22:19,780 --> 01:22:21,940
Sorry about dinner.

1149
01:22:46,820 --> 01:22:48,339
You don't smoke.

1150
01:22:48,340 --> 01:22:51,060
I also don't frequent cafes.

1151
01:22:59,140 --> 01:23:02,419
This the file on Irene Adler?

1152
01:23:02,420 --> 01:23:04,339
Closed forever.

1153
01:23:04,340 --> 01:23:06,939
I am about to go
and inform my brother

1154
01:23:06,940 --> 01:23:08,859
or, if you prefer, you are

1155
01:23:08,860 --> 01:23:14,099
that she somehow got herself into a
witness protection scheme in America.

1156
01:23:14,100 --> 01:23:16,939
New name, new identity.

1157
01:23:16,940 --> 01:23:20,819
She will survive and thrive...

1158
01:23:20,820 --> 01:23:22,739
but he will never see her again.

1159
01:23:22,740 --> 01:23:24,099
Why would he care?

1160
01:23:24,100 --> 01:23:26,499
He despised her at the end.

1161
01:23:26,500 --> 01:23:29,539
Won't even mention her by name,
just 'The Woman'.

1162
01:23:29,540 --> 01:23:32,100
Is that loathing or a salute?

1163
01:23:33,540 --> 01:23:36,739
One of a kind,
the one woman who matters.

1164
01:23:36,740 --> 01:23:39,099
He's not like that.

1165
01:23:39,100 --> 01:23:42,859
He doesn't feel things that way,
I don't think.

1166
01:23:42,860 --> 01:23:46,499
My brother has the brain
of a scientist or a philosopher,

1167
01:23:46,500 --> 01:23:48,540
yet he elects to be a detective.

1168
01:23:49,900 --> 01:23:51,979
What might we deduce
about his heart?

1169
01:23:51,980 --> 01:23:53,339
I don't know.

1170
01:23:53,340 --> 01:23:55,579
Neither do I.

1171
01:23:55,580 --> 01:23:58,620
But, initially,
he wanted to be a pirate.

1172
01:24:00,940 --> 01:24:02,220
He'll be OK with this

1173
01:24:02,221 --> 01:24:03,860
witness protection, never
seeing her again

1174
01:24:03,861 --> 01:24:05,499
he'll be fine.

1175
01:24:05,500 --> 01:24:07,779
I agree.

1176
01:24:07,780 --> 01:24:10,140
That's why I decided
to tell him that.

1177
01:24:12,380 --> 01:24:14,020
Instead of what?

1178
01:24:15,260 --> 01:24:16,660
She's dead.

1179
01:24:17,980 --> 01:24:21,259
She was captured by a terrorist
cell in Karachi two months ago

1180
01:24:21,260 --> 01:24:23,740
and beheaded.

1181
01:24:28,220 --> 01:24:29,739
It was definitely her?

1182
01:24:29,740 --> 01:24:31,299
She's done this before.

1183
01:24:31,300 --> 01:24:33,380
I was thorough this time.

1184
01:24:34,620 --> 01:24:37,579
It would take
Sherlock Holmes to fool me,

1185
01:24:37,580 --> 01:24:40,820
and I don't think
he was on hand, do you?

1186
01:24:42,420 --> 01:24:43,700
So...

1187
01:24:50,780 --> 01:24:52,820
What shall we tell Sherlock?

1188
01:25:00,020 --> 01:25:01,739
Clearly you've got news.

1189
01:25:01,740 --> 01:25:05,219
If it's about the Leeds triple
murder, it was the gardener.

1190
01:25:05,220 --> 01:25:07,739
Did nobody notice the earring? Hi.

1191
01:25:07,740 --> 01:25:12,660
No, it's, um... it's about
Irene Adler.

1192
01:25:14,380 --> 01:25:16,179
Well?

1193
01:25:16,180 --> 01:25:18,499
Something happened?
Has she come back?

1194
01:25:18,500 --> 01:25:22,019
No, she's... I bumped into Mycroft
downstairs, he had to take a call.

1195
01:25:22,020 --> 01:25:23,779
Is she back in London?

1196
01:25:23,780 --> 01:25:26,019
No...

1197
01:25:26,020 --> 01:25:27,540
She's...

1198
01:25:31,100 --> 01:25:34,099
She's in America.
America?

1199
01:25:34,100 --> 01:25:37,499
Got herself on a witness protection
scheme, apparently.

1200
01:25:37,500 --> 01:25:42,379
Don't know how she swung it,
but... well, you know.

1201
01:25:42,380 --> 01:25:44,739
I know what? You won't be able
to see her again.

1202
01:25:44,740 --> 01:25:48,539
Why would I want to see her again?
Didn't say you did.

1203
01:25:48,540 --> 01:25:51,699
Is that her file? Yes, I was going
to take it back to Mycroft.

1204
01:25:51,700 --> 01:25:53,260
Do you want to... No.

1205
01:26:01,940 --> 01:26:03,619
Listen, actually...

1206
01:26:03,620 --> 01:26:05,780
But I will have
the camera-phone though.

1207
01:26:06,980 --> 01:26:10,619
There's nothing on it, it's been
stripped... I know, but I...

1208
01:26:10,620 --> 01:26:12,139
I'll still have it.

1209
01:26:12,140 --> 01:26:15,300
I've got to give this back to
Mycroft, you can't keep it.

1210
01:26:16,740 --> 01:26:20,779
Sherlock, I have to give this to
Mycroft, it's the government's now...

1211
01:26:20,780 --> 01:26:22,700
Please.

1212
01:26:35,420 --> 01:26:37,100
Thank you.

1213
01:26:38,940 --> 01:26:41,260
Well, I'd better take this back.
Yes.

1214
01:26:50,020 --> 01:26:54,339
Did she ever text you again,
after all that?

1215
01:26:54,340 --> 01:26:56,859
Once, a few months ago.

1216
01:26:56,860 --> 01:26:59,139
What did she say?

1217
01:26:59,140 --> 01:27:00,900
"Goodbye, Mr Holmes."

1218
01:28:13,100 --> 01:28:14,859
When I say run...

1219
01:28:14,860 --> 01:28:17,380
run!

1220
01:28:33,740 --> 01:28:35,740
The Woman.

1221
01:28:43,340 --> 01:28:45,580
<i>The</i> Woman.
