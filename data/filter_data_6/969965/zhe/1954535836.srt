1
00:00:02,400 --> 00:00:04,320
太棒了
This is awesome.

2
00:00:04,430 --> 00:00:06,850
我真不敢相信 这个时刻终于到来了
I can't believe this moment's finally here.

3
00:00:06,880 --> 00:00:10,390
再开一英里 我的爱车就 开了200,000英里了
One more mile and my little boy turns 200,000.

4
00:00:10,420 --> 00:00:13,780
你的宝贝菲奥罗 已经开成老爷车了
Your baby Fiero's grown into a really old man Fiero.

5
00:00:13,810 --> 00:00:15,320
一个糟老头
And just like an old man,

6
00:00:15,350 --> 00:00:17,220
爱流口水 闻起来臭烘烘
he leaks fluid, smells stale,

7
00:00:17,250 --> 00:00:18,870
走路的时候还放屁
makes weird noises out the back.

8
00:00:18,900 --> 00:00:20,040
确实是
Yeah, he does.

9
00:00:20,070 --> 00:00:22,240
把雪茄从车柜里拿出来
Hey, light up those cigars in the glove compartment.

10
00:00:22,560 --> 00:00:25,050
这是地道的古巴雪茄 去年在唐人街买的
They're real Cubans. I got 'em in Chinatown last year

11
00:00:25,080 --> 00:00:26,270
就是为了这个时刻
just for this moment.

12
00:00:26,570 --> 00:00:29,240
我不想说说你被宰了
Uh, Marshall, I'm not saying you were definitely ripped off,

13
00:00:29,270 --> 00:00:32,630
但他们确实是包在纸巾中的筷子
but these are chopsticks wrapped in napkins.

14
00:00:32,660 --> 00:00:34,200
- 你说什么? - 注意 下水道盖
- What are you talking about? - Whoa, pothole.

15
00:00:34,230 --> 00:00:36,690
什么? 别 别
What? No. Oh. No.

16
00:00:36,720 --> 00:00:38,230
别这样啊
No, no, no.

17
00:00:38,260 --> 00:00:40,840
只有0.8英里就到了 加油啊 哥们
No, there's only .8 miles to go. Come on, buddy.

18
00:00:40,870 --> 00:00:42,030
兄弟
Buddy!

19
00:00:47,990 --> 00:00:49,680
我点燃他们还有意义?
Is it cool if I still light these?

24
00:01:07,400 --> 00:01:11,360
孩子们 生活有时候 强迫我们做不愿做的事
Kids, sometimes life forces us to be someone we didn't want to be.

25
00:01:11,440 --> 00:01:15,250
这种事情发生时 我们总要试着保留点自我
When that happens, we often try to hold on to a little piece of who we were.

26
00:01:15,610 --> 00:01:17,000
比方说一个纹身
Maybe a tattoo.

27
00:01:17,630 --> 00:01:19,300
或者一个小首饰
Or a piece of jewelry.

28
00:01:19,420 --> 00:01:22,740
一个微不足道的纪念品提醒我们 "这才是真的自我"
A tiny souvenir that reminds us, "This is who I really am."

29
00:01:23,280 --> 00:01:25,600
马修的纪念品可不小
Marshall's souvenir was not so tiny,

30
00:01:25,820 --> 00:01:28,550
他从现实世界得到的越多
but the more he found himself being pushed toward the corporate world

31
00:01:28,580 --> 00:01:31,080
离他的保护环境的理想就越远
and away from his dream of saving the environment,

32
00:01:31,110 --> 00:01:33,620
他对菲奥罗就看的越重
the tighter he held on to that Fiero.

33
00:01:33,798 --> 00:01:34,793
Hey.

34
00:01:35,220 --> 00:01:37,960
我们今天肯定赶不上叠纸聚会了
One good thing: we're off the hook for the folding party today.

35
00:01:37,990 --> 00:01:41,440
这对我和莉莉来说很重要的
Hey. It's very important to both Lily and me

36
00:01:41,470 --> 00:01:45,110
我们俩都要 为我们婚礼做个折纸鸟...
that there be a handmade origami crane in each of our wedding's...

37
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:48,080
其实我根本不会折 谢天谢地
I couldn't even get through it. Thank God.

38
00:01:48,160 --> 00:01:49,970
你的车会修好的
Hey, your car's going to be fine.

39
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:52,000
这是附近最好的修车行了
This is the best auto shop around.

40
00:01:52,030 --> 00:01:53,690
看这个证书
Look at this certificate.

41
00:01:53,720 --> 00:01:55,540
这其中一个技师
One of the mechanics here

42
00:01:56,010 --> 00:01:58,190
吃光了64盎司牛排
finished a 64-ounce steak.

43
00:01:59,160 --> 00:02:00,240
惊喜吧
Surprise.

44
00:02:00,270 --> 00:02:01,990
我们觉得你们俩不来没意思
We felt bad that you guys were missing

45
00:02:02,020 --> 00:02:04,790
超有趣的手工叠纸聚会 所以...
the super-fun origami folding party, so...

46
00:02:04,820 --> 00:02:06,300
我们建议到这来
we suggested moving it here.

47
00:02:06,330 --> 00:02:07,840
我们坚持这样 (没有征求他意见)
We insisted.

48
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:09,380
好极了
Terrific.

49
00:02:09,850 --> 00:02:11,200
菲奥雷怎么样了
How's the Fiero?

50
00:02:11,640 --> 00:02:13,120
她还在治疗呢
She's still in triage.

51
00:02:13,150 --> 00:02:15,540
她?我还以为是你当他是男的
She? I thought it was your little boy.

52
00:02:15,570 --> 00:02:18,870
它可男可女 他是辆会变性的车
Oh, it goes back and forth. It's sort of a tranny car.

53
00:02:18,900 --> 00:02:22,350
你开她多久了 应该是他
How long have you had her... slash him?

54
00:02:22,550 --> 00:02:25,380
我16岁时我哥留给我了
My brothers handed it down to me when I was 16.

55
00:02:25,410 --> 00:02:26,870
他们太好了
Oh, how nice of them.

56
00:02:26,900 --> 00:02:28,360
也不算
Not really.

57
00:02:29,050 --> 00:02:30,320
祝贺你
Congratulations.

58
00:02:30,350 --> 00:02:32,120
菲奥雷是你的了
The Fiero is yours.

59
00:02:34,170 --> 00:02:36,850
如果你通过最后的考试
If you pass the final test.

60
00:02:36,880 --> 00:02:38,230
快啊
Come on!

61
00:02:38,260 --> 00:02:41,780
我在房间里已经刮光腿毛 还把5美元分四份吞了下去
I already shaved my legs and swallowed five dollars in quarters.

62
00:02:41,810 --> 00:02:43,800
只拉出来4.5美元
Only $4.50 has come out.

63
00:02:44,720 --> 00:02:47,000
那去威纳汉堡汽车外卖
Just go to the Weinerburger drive-thru

64
00:02:47,030 --> 00:02:48,890
帮我们买12杯咖啡
and get us 12 cups of coffee.

65
00:02:49,480 --> 00:02:51,260
- 就这个? - 恩 就这个
- That's it? - Oh, yeah.

66
00:02:51,290 --> 00:02:53,260
但我们决定你穿什么
But we get to decide what you wear.

67
00:02:54,130 --> 00:02:57,660
同意 完全同意
Agreed. Totally agreed.

68
00:03:02,150 --> 00:03:03,610
你裸体啊
You're naked.

69
00:03:03,640 --> 00:03:05,360
我知道
I'm aware of that.

70
00:03:09,190 --> 00:03:10,790
有50美分吗
You have 50 cents?

71
00:03:12,260 --> 00:03:13,490
没有
No...

72
00:03:14,730 --> 00:03:16,800
我只想要咖啡 行吗?
Look, can I just have my coffee, please?

73
00:03:17,070 --> 00:03:19,290
对不起 我们没有托架和盖了
Sorry, we're all out of trays and lids.

74
00:03:19,320 --> 00:03:22,700
两个高个的家伙几分钟前 过来把他们都买了
Two tall guys just came through here a few minutes ago and bought 'em all.

75
00:03:40,070 --> 00:03:42,670
这就是马修愚蠢的
And that is the origin of Marshall's insane

76
00:03:42,700 --> 00:03:45,430
"禁止车内有食物 饮料 甚至杂货" 规定的出处
"no food or drinks in the Fiero, not even groceries" rule.

77
00:03:45,460 --> 00:03:47,110
这不愚蠢
It is not insane.

78
00:03:47,170 --> 00:03:51,100
\这好像是你连续叠坏的第三个
Barney. That's like the third one in a row that you've screwed up.

79
00:03:51,130 --> 00:03:53,010
我正在试 但它...
Well, I'm trying, but it's...

80
00:03:53,040 --> 00:03:56,480
听着 演中线对折两次 把尾巴拉出来
Look. You fold twice to the middle, fold back and forth, pull the ends out,

81
00:03:56,510 --> 00:04:00,480
翻过来 打开 再折边 折头 再对折
flip over, open the flaps, fold the edges, crease the front, fold in half,

82
00:04:00,510 --> 00:04:03,510
把翅膀向下拉 推到底角 在把翅膀拉出来
fold the wings down, push in the bottom corners, and fold the wings back out.

83
00:04:03,540 --> 00:04:06,770
你难道想让小孩给你示范?
Or would you like one of my kindergartners to show you?

84
00:04:07,430 --> 00:04:09,740
等等 我想我知道怎么弄了
Wait, wait, wait. Wait, I think I've got it.

85
00:04:11,330 --> 00:04:12,390
不
No.

86
00:04:12,820 --> 00:04:15,670
算了吧 纸太贵了 你别弄了
Forget it; the paper's too expensive. You're out.

87
00:04:15,700 --> 00:04:17,390
胡扯
Aw, nerts.

88
00:04:20,340 --> 00:04:23,430
食物规定是愚蠢的 我们差点因为这个死了
The food rule is insane. We could have died because of it.

89
00:04:23,460 --> 00:04:26,480
- 还记得100,000英里时的惨痛经历 - 费奥罗的惨败(fiero-asco拆字)
- Remember the 100K fiasco? - Ah, the Fiero-asco.

90
00:04:26,510 --> 00:04:29,990
兄弟 我告诉你不行 它已经跑了100,000英里了
Dude, I told you that doesn't work. It's the 100K fiasco.

91
00:04:30,020 --> 00:04:32,530
- 什么是100,000英里时的惨痛经历 - 是费奥罗的惨痛经历?
- What's the 100K fiasco? - The Fiero-asco?

92
00:04:32,990 --> 00:04:35,350
那是在大学第一年寒假之前
It was just before winter break our freshman year of college.

93
00:04:35,380 --> 00:04:37,870
马修和我是室友 但我们那时还不是好朋友
Marshall and I were roommates, but we weren't really good friends yet.

94
00:04:37,900 --> 00:04:40,400
我觉得泰德有点自命不凡
I thought Ted was a little bit pretentious.

95
00:04:40,430 --> 00:04:42,920
马修是个大懒汉
And Marshall was a total slob.

96
00:04:43,876 --> 00:04:44,860
Hey.

97
00:04:45,990 --> 00:04:48,480
假期结束的话 我开着我的菲奥雷来学校
I'm driving my Fiero back over break.

98
00:04:48,510 --> 00:04:50,600
我知道虽然我们互相都看腻了
I know we see enough of each other as it is,

99
00:04:50,630 --> 00:04:53,290
但你想搭车的话 我可以多花点油钱
but if you want a ride, I could use the gas money.

100
00:04:53,320 --> 00:04:56,310
你住俄亥俄州 不是吗? 我可以绕点道去接你
You live in Ohio, right? I could swing through and pick you up.

101
00:04:56,640 --> 00:04:59,810
打住 首先 我父母住俄亥俄州
All right, first of all, my parents live in Ohio.

102
00:04:59,840 --> 00:05:01,940
我现在住这(我活在当下,Ted又在帅酷)
I live in the moment.

103
00:05:02,500 --> 00:05:05,420
凯伦和我从感恩节就再也没见了
Plus, Karen and I haven't seen each other since Thanksgiving.

104
00:05:05,450 --> 00:05:09,500
我们都想弥补这么 远距离的相思...
We're both really invested in making this long-distance thing work, so...

105
00:05:09,750 --> 00:05:11,740
改主意的话给我打电话
All right, well, call me if you change your mind.

106
00:05:11,770 --> 00:05:13,830
我的车要冲击100K英里了
My odometer's going to hit 100K.

107
00:05:15,470 --> 00:05:17,900
如果我提前走的话 凯伦会很无聊的
She'd be so bummed if I left early.

108
00:05:18,610 --> 00:05:20,530
都出了问题
It was totally mutual.

109
00:05:21,130 --> 00:05:23,730
我意思是 凯伦挑起的 但我...
I mean, Karen brought it up first, but I...

110
00:05:23,760 --> 00:05:26,300
但是 双方都有错
it was... it was totally mutual.

111
00:05:26,920 --> 00:05:28,190
我听见了
I hear you.

112
00:05:28,630 --> 00:05:31,110
那你和莉莉怎么样?是认真的吗?
So what's up with you and Lily? Anything serious?

113
00:05:31,410 --> 00:05:32,460
那当然
Yeah.

114
00:05:32,490 --> 00:05:34,160
兄弟 我们大学才刚开始
Dude, we're college freshmen.

115
00:05:34,190 --> 00:05:36,870
我怎么会为了 一颗树而放弃整座森林
I'm not going to get tied down by the first chick I hook up with.

116
00:05:36,900 --> 00:05:40,890
莉莉很好 但是我 不会和她认真的 你知道吗?
Lily's cool, but this bird you'll never chain, you know?

117
00:05:40,970 --> 00:05:44,660
接下来的几个小时车程是经典公路旅行
The next few hours of our drive were classic road trip.

118
00:05:54,600 --> 00:05:57,540
这首歌...
So... this song.

119
00:05:57,570 --> 00:05:59,510
这是世界上最好听的歌了
Oh, it's the best song in the world.

120
00:05:59,540 --> 00:06:01,440
我唯一喜欢的歌
It's the only song I like.

121
00:06:02,320 --> 00:06:03,640
开玩笑的
Just kidding.

122
00:06:03,740 --> 00:06:06,370
磁带卡在录音机里面了 好像两年了
Tape's been stuck in the player for, like, two years.

123
00:06:06,400 --> 00:06:08,010
反正比什么没有强
Better than nothing, though.

124
00:06:08,820 --> 00:06:10,060
也许吧
Maybe.

125
00:06:19,260 --> 00:06:24,130
我真的对这首歌感到恶心了
I am so... sick... of this song.

126
00:06:24,420 --> 00:06:26,050
别担心 又要重放了
Don't worry. It comes around again.

127
00:06:26,430 --> 00:06:27,690
你什么意思?
What do you mean?

128
00:06:27,725 --> 00:06:32,020
# Just to be the man who walks 1,000 miles #

129
00:06:32,058 --> 00:06:37,653
# And falls down at your door... #

130
00:06:39,700 --> 00:06:41,340
我们终于从头唱到尾了
Yeah, we totally nailed the ending.

131
00:06:41,370 --> 00:06:43,010
这可能是我们唱的最好的一次了
That was probably our best one.

132
00:06:43,300 --> 00:06:45,180
你玩过Zitch dog的游戏吗?
Hey, you want to play Zitch Dog?

133
00:06:45,250 --> 00:06:46,810
- 什么? - 是个在车上玩得游戏
- What? - Uh, it's a car game.

134
00:06:46,840 --> 00:06:50,230
每见到一次狗 你就得马上说 "Zitch dog"
Every time you see a dog, you got to be the first one to say, "Zitch dog."

135
00:06:50,310 --> 00:06:51,930
- 我玩得很好 所以... - Zitch dog
- I'm pretty good, so... - Zitch dog.

136
00:06:52,460 --> 00:06:55,530
不 我不知道我们已经... 我们开始 但是
Well, no, I didn't know we had... we'd started, but...

137
00:06:55,560 --> 00:06:57,690
行吧 你得第一分
Okay, that's cool. You got the first point.

138
00:06:58,920 --> 00:07:00,990
- Zitch dog - 该死
- Zitch dog. - Zitch dog. Damn it!

139
00:07:02,040 --> 00:07:04,420
我们还要玩?  因为 我不是 我不是真的...
Are we still playing? 'Cause I wasn't... I wasn't really...

140
00:07:04,450 --> 00:07:05,590
12比0
12-nothing.

141
00:07:07,050 --> 00:07:08,220
马修
Marshall.

142
00:07:12,060 --> 00:07:14,490
- 马修 - Zitch dog  blue Suburban  (狗品种)
- Marshall. - Zitch dog, blue Suburban.

143
00:07:14,520 --> 00:07:15,560
该死
Damn it!

144
00:07:15,590 --> 00:07:17,110
18比0
18-nothing.

145
00:07:18,250 --> 00:07:20,630
然后马修忙于 在Zitch dog游戏中耍赖
Then Marshall, who was so busy cheating at Zitch Dog,

146
00:07:20,660 --> 00:07:22,050
让我们迷路了
got us totally lost.

147
00:07:22,080 --> 00:07:23,530
我们他妈的在哪?
Where the hell are we?!

148
00:07:23,560 --> 00:07:26,330
等等
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa. Hold on.

149
00:07:26,360 --> 00:07:27,980
我想你跳过了一些东西
I think you skipped something.

150
00:07:28,010 --> 00:07:30,610
真的吗? 听起来不可能
Really? Seems impossible.

151
00:07:32,460 --> 00:07:33,890
我们还有点时间
Hey, we got some time.

152
00:07:34,370 --> 00:07:38,110
你说我们下高速 去以前没怎么开过的路 怎么样?
What do you say we get off the highway, take the road less traveled, you know?

153
00:07:38,628 --> 00:07:40,011
Robert Frost.

154
00:07:41,050 --> 00:07:42,860
这主意不太好
Doesn't seem like a smart idea.

155
00:07:42,890 --> 00:07:43,930
时间太迟了
Too late.

156
00:07:43,960 --> 00:07:45,650
我从这个出口下
I'm taking this exit.

157
00:07:46,020 --> 00:07:49,000
是谁不够幽默呢 凯伦?
Who's not fun enough now, Karen?

158
00:07:51,320 --> 00:07:52,840
然后我们迷路了
Then we got lost.

159
00:07:52,870 --> 00:07:54,580
我们他妈的在哪?
Where the hell are we?!

160
00:07:54,880 --> 00:07:57,060
- 我靠边吧 - 别 继续开
- I'm pulling over. - No, keep driving.

161
00:07:57,090 --> 00:07:59,850
我们已经快没油了 而且我们可能都不在马路上了
We're almost out of gas, and we might not even be on a road anymore.

162
00:07:59,880 --> 00:08:03,190
外面零下了 我们要是靠边 我们会被雪困上几天了
It's below zero out. If we pull over, we could be snowed in for days.

163
00:08:03,220 --> 00:08:06,050
我只有 6个格兰诺拉条和三瓶水
Plus, I only have, like, six granola bars and three bottles of water.

164
00:08:06,080 --> 00:08:07,640
- 我早丢出去了 - 什么?
- Nah, I threw them out. - What?!

165
00:08:07,670 --> 00:08:11,090
菲奥雷上严禁食物和饮料
No food or drink in the Fiero.

166
00:08:12,120 --> 00:08:15,620
严禁食物和水? 你多久开始就没洗床单了
No food or drink in the F...? You haven't washed your sheets since...

167
00:08:15,650 --> 00:08:18,470
这样开始了 我们生命最长的夜晚
Thus began the longest night of our lives.

168
00:08:22,510 --> 00:08:25,920
我脚肯定冻僵了
Pretty sure that my foot is frozen solid.

169
00:08:26,570 --> 00:08:27,690
马修...
Marshall...

170
00:08:28,800 --> 00:08:32,150
这下很有可能我们被雪困上几天了
there's a very real chance that we're gonna be snowed in here for days.

171
00:08:32,930 --> 00:08:36,070
如果我先死了 为了活下去你可以随便把我怎么样
If I die first, do whatever you need to survive.

172
00:08:36,100 --> 00:08:37,280
吃我的肉
Eat my flesh.

173
00:08:37,310 --> 00:08:39,840
把我象星球大战巨兽剖开 随便怎样...
Slice me open like a tauntaun, whatever.

174
00:08:40,470 --> 00:08:42,010
谢了 泰德
Thanks, Ted.

175
00:08:42,570 --> 00:08:44,280
你是个好友
You're a good friend.

176
00:08:45,100 --> 00:08:48,780
如果我死了 你不能动我的尸体
And if I die first, you just leave my body alone.

177
00:08:48,810 --> 00:08:49,770
什么?
What?

178
00:08:49,800 --> 00:08:51,990
我刚刚还说了你可以剖开我 钻到我身体里
I just said you could cut me open and crawl inside me.

179
00:08:52,020 --> 00:08:54,560
别跟我说这些 太恶心了
Yeah, don't do any of that stuff to me; it skeeves me out.

180
00:08:54,590 --> 00:08:57,660
但... 要是你死了 如果我不...也的死啊
But... but you're dead, and I'm gonna die if I don't.

181
00:08:57,690 --> 00:08:59,690
很难决定啊
Wasn't an easy decision.

182
00:09:00,620 --> 00:09:03,640
都是你那愚蠢的 不能放食物的规定
This is all because of your insane no-food rule.

183
00:09:04,150 --> 00:09:06,140
这绝对是理性的决定
It's perfectly rational.

184
00:09:10,550 --> 00:09:12,930
我的眼镜
Hey! My spectacles!

185
00:09:18,308 --> 00:09:19,141
Hey.

186
00:09:20,710 --> 00:09:22,460
我知道我们快没油了
I know we're low on gas,

187
00:09:23,180 --> 00:09:26,400
但我们能开会暖气?
but can we turn on the heat for just a minute?

188
00:09:27,896 --> 00:09:29,222
Okay.

189
00:09:39,410 --> 00:09:40,510
兄弟
Dude...

190
00:09:41,310 --> 00:09:43,120
我不想这么说
I hate to say this...

191
00:09:44,380 --> 00:09:46,290
但是真的好冷
but it's so cold...

192
00:09:46,910 --> 00:09:50,250
只有一个办法我们能渡过今晚了
there's only one way that we're gonna make it through this night.

193
00:09:56,280 --> 00:09:59,050
- 我们应该继续向前开 - 别这样 马修
- We should've kept driving. - Come on, Marshall.

194
00:09:59,080 --> 00:10:02,290
我们说不定现在已经挂了
No. No. We might die now.

195
00:10:02,860 --> 00:10:05,050
我再也见不到莉莉了
I may never see Lily again.

196
00:10:05,870 --> 00:10:08,180
我没有告诉过任何人这事 但是...
I never told anybody this, but...

197
00:10:08,800 --> 00:10:11,910
我早知道了我会和这个女孩结婚
I've known for a long time that I'm gonna marry that girl.

198
00:10:12,590 --> 00:10:15,840
如果我们活下来了 我有一天一定娶她
If we survive this, someday I'm gonna marry her.

199
00:10:18,090 --> 00:10:20,430
对于你的眼镜 我很抱歉
I'm sorry about your spectacles.

200
00:10:21,200 --> 00:10:22,390
没事
That's okay.

201
00:10:23,290 --> 00:10:24,960
它们是装饰用的
They were decorative.

202
00:10:30,760 --> 00:10:32,110
马修
Hey, Marshall.

203
00:10:32,280 --> 00:10:33,530
怎么了
Yeah?

204
00:10:34,530 --> 00:10:36,820
你还在想莉莉?
Are you still thinking about Lily?

205
00:10:37,155 --> 00:10:38,511
Yeah.

206
00:10:38,940 --> 00:10:40,670
请别想了
Please stop.

207
00:10:44,150 --> 00:10:47,640
接下来马修和我都以为 我们会死在这偏僻的地方
And so Marshall and I thought we were gonna die out there in the middle of nowhere.

208
00:10:47,670 --> 00:10:49,870
但是有趣的事发生了...
But funny thing...

209
00:10:57,920 --> 00:11:02,190
你们这对恋人 最好不要停在这
Hey. You lovers better just keep on driving.

210
00:11:04,090 --> 00:11:06,080
- Zitch dog! - 该死
- Zitch dog! - Damn it!

211
00:11:07,880 --> 00:11:10,780
你那么久之前就说了要娶我啊?
You said you were gonna marry me that long ago?

212
00:11:10,810 --> 00:11:12,630
太感动了
That is so sweet.

213
00:11:12,660 --> 00:11:15,330
这趟旅行让我俩成为了好朋友
That trip is when Marshall and I became best friends.

214
00:11:15,430 --> 00:11:17,910
听起来好像就你有特权
With privileges, from the sound of it.

215
00:11:19,400 --> 00:11:20,810
埃里克森
Eriksen.

216
00:11:41,876 --> 00:11:42,871
Wow.

217
00:11:43,210 --> 00:11:45,300
他现在需要个拥抱
Looks like he really needs a hug.

218
00:11:46,690 --> 00:11:47,880
泰德
Ted.

219
00:11:56,900 --> 00:12:00,880
他说让它能再开动 至少花3,000美元
He said it would be at least 3,000 bucks to make it run again.

220
00:12:00,970 --> 00:12:03,480
就是这样 还不敢打保票
And even then, there's no guarantee.

221
00:12:03,610 --> 00:12:05,190
算了 它确实是太旧了
Well, it's a pretty old car.

222
00:12:05,220 --> 00:12:07,820
你可以继续延长它寿命
Yeah. You can keep prolonging its life,

223
00:12:07,850 --> 00:12:11,050
但毕竟 它只是一个机器
but it's really mostly machine at this point.

224
00:12:12,760 --> 00:12:14,620
我知道要花很多钱
I know that it's a lot of money,

225
00:12:14,770 --> 00:12:17,110
但是它是我的菲奥雷 你知道吗?
but it's my Fiero, you know?

226
00:12:17,380 --> 00:12:20,950
我就要毕业了 还可以靠当法人律师赚点外快
I'm about to graduate and take some sellout corporate law job,

227
00:12:20,980 --> 00:12:23,660
没有了它 我就像跟那个穿西装 行尸走肉一样了
and without that Fiero, I'm just another guy in a suit.

228
00:12:23,690 --> 00:12:25,280
你疯了啊 干嘛扯到我
- How dare you... - Hey.

229
00:12:26,320 --> 00:12:28,820
这辆车和我一起经历了太多太多
I've been through so much in that car.

230
00:12:29,410 --> 00:12:31,410
自杀的猫
The suicidal cat.

231
00:12:34,230 --> 00:12:35,930
搭车的沃尔特
Hitchhiking Waldo.

232
00:12:39,870 --> 00:12:42,220
打烂车窗的流浪汉
The homeless guy who broke in through the window

233
00:12:42,250 --> 00:12:44,680
还在杂物都撇在后座
and threw up all over the backseat.

234
00:12:44,710 --> 00:12:45,830
莉莉 别...
Lily, don't.

235
00:12:45,860 --> 00:12:48,040
坚强点 别让我陷入囚徒困境 (两头为难)
Be strong. Do not go all "prisoner's dilemma" on me.

236
00:12:48,070 --> 00:12:50,930
这车就要报废了 罗宾 我得有良心啊
The car's on its deathbed, Robin. I have to clear my conscience.

237
00:12:50,960 --> 00:12:52,400
你们说什么呢?
Guys, what are you talking about?

238
00:12:53,310 --> 00:12:56,510
我们遇到罗宾没多久
Okay. Shortly after we met Robin,

239
00:12:56,560 --> 00:12:59,650
她和我都对同个地方的 泰国菜上瘾了
she and I were jonesing for Thai food from this one place.

240
00:12:59,680 --> 00:13:02,590
外卖得等一个半小时 我们等不及了
An hour and a half delivery. We can't wait that long.

241
00:13:02,620 --> 00:13:07,010
我希望我们能用菲奥雷 但马修有个愚蠢的不能放食物的规定
I wish we could take the Fiero, but Marshall has this insane no-food rule.

242
00:13:07,040 --> 00:13:08,680
但是是泰国菜啊 莉莉
But Thai food, Lily.

243
00:13:08,710 --> 00:13:10,360
Pad Yum Mao (菜名)
Pad Yum Mao.

244
00:13:10,390 --> 00:13:12,180
Tom Kai Gah (菜名)
Tom Kai Gah.

245
00:13:12,210 --> 00:13:13,860
Thai See Ran (菜名)
Thai See Ran.

246
00:13:13,890 --> 00:13:17,700
连你随便报的几个菜名 也听起来这么好吃
Oh! You're just saying random syllables, and it still sounds delicious.

247
00:13:17,760 --> 00:13:19,920
好的 我们开车去吧
Okay. Here's what we'll do.

248
00:13:19,950 --> 00:13:23,500
我们开过去 拿了菜 把它们包两层
We'll drive over, pick it up, have them double-bag it,

249
00:13:23,530 --> 00:13:27,310
把窗户打开非常小心的开回来
very carefully drive it back here with the windows open,

250
00:13:27,340 --> 00:13:29,060
他肯定不知道的
and he'll never know.

251
00:13:29,090 --> 00:13:31,570
这刹车也太灵了...
Wow, these brakes are really sensitive.

252
00:13:31,730 --> 00:13:33,980
马修会杀了我的
Oh, Marshall is gonna kill me!

253
00:13:34,010 --> 00:13:37,350
这件事和 关于"affect"和"effect"的区别那件事
This and the difference between "affect" and "effect" are the only two things

254
00:13:37,380 --> 00:13:39,010
他真的对这两个较真的
he's really serious about.

255
00:13:39,040 --> 00:13:40,880
- 莉莉 会没事的 - 不 出事了
- Lily, it's gonna be fine. - No, it's not.

256
00:13:40,910 --> 00:13:43,460
天啊 马修会发飙的 我们怎么办啊
Marshall's gonna freak. Oh, God, oh, God. What are we gonna do?

257
00:13:43,490 --> 00:13:44,720
-咋办啊 -闭嘴
- Oh, God, oh...! - Shut up!

258
00:13:44,750 --> 00:13:46,900
现在听我的 时间在流逝
Now, listen to me. The clock is ticking.

259
00:13:46,930 --> 00:13:50,500
首先 我们把所有 豆腐和菜叶子拣起来
Okay, first thing, we scoop up all these little pieces of tofu and cabbage.

260
00:13:50,530 --> 00:13:52,910
然后 我们需要做的 就是清理乱七八糟的东西
Next, what we need to take care of are the really messy parts--

261
00:13:52,940 --> 00:13:55,620
还有汤 我们要把它弄干
the pools that have collected. We got to soak that soup up.

262
00:13:55,650 --> 00:13:58,500
最后是我们需要 把Tom Kah Gai的味盖住
Last is the smell. We got to cover up that Tom Kah Gai.

263
00:13:58,530 --> 00:13:59,740
你说有雪茄
You mentioned cigars.

264
00:13:59,770 --> 00:14:01,970
两个在车柜里面 他一直留着的
There's two in the glove compartment, but he's been saving them.

265
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:03,560
把那些筷子递给我
Hand me those chopsticks.

266
00:14:08,190 --> 00:14:09,820
来点音乐吧?
Hey, how about some tunes?

267
00:14:11,930 --> 00:14:14,290
太好听了
Oh, great song.

268
00:14:16,750 --> 00:14:18,970
这些雪茄根本没有用啊
These cigars aren't helping at all.

269
00:14:19,000 --> 00:14:21,430
确实不是个好主意
Yeah. This was a terrible idea.

270
00:14:22,980 --> 00:14:27,150
闻起来就像流浪汉躺过一样
Now it just smells like a homeless guy threw up in here.

271
00:14:29,550 --> 00:14:31,180
砸坏的玻璃?
The broken windows?

272
00:14:31,220 --> 00:14:32,780
我们想看起来更真实
We had to make it look realistic.

273
00:14:32,810 --> 00:14:34,770
那你砸坏两个干嘛
Why did you break two of them?

274
00:14:34,800 --> 00:14:38,390
看她砸窗挺好玩的 我也试了一次
It looked like fun when she did it. So I wanted to try.

275
00:14:39,440 --> 00:14:41,510
真不敢相信是你们俩干的
Can't believe this whole time it was you guys.

276
00:14:41,540 --> 00:14:44,160
我还一直怪那个穿紧身衣 深色皮肤的舞蹈演员
I've been blaming really tanned dancing leotard guy.

277
00:14:44,190 --> 00:14:47,670
马修 对不起 但这个秘密也
Marshall, I'm so sorry, but sharing that secret--

278
00:14:47,700 --> 00:14:50,450
让罗宾和我成为最好的朋友了
that's when Robin and I became best friends.

279
00:14:50,480 --> 00:14:53,160
太特殊的车了
Wow. What a special car.

280
00:14:53,190 --> 00:14:55,390
现在还要报废吗
So, can I crush it into a little cube yet?

281
00:14:55,420 --> 00:14:57,540
我不知道
I don't know. I don't know. I don't know.

282
00:14:57,630 --> 00:14:58,900
快点 马修
Come on, Marshall.

283
00:14:58,930 --> 00:15:00,470
这是你的
This is your Fiero.

284
00:15:00,500 --> 00:15:02,500
你知道该怎么做
You know the right thing to do here.

285
00:15:02,530 --> 00:15:05,180
你为什么这么爱这车?
Wow, Barney, why do you love that car so much?

286
00:15:05,210 --> 00:15:06,660
爱它?
Love it?

287
00:15:07,010 --> 00:15:08,510
等会
Hold on a second.

288
00:15:09,330 --> 00:15:10,770
爱它?
Love it?

289
00:15:10,830 --> 00:15:12,810
我恨他
I hate it!

290
00:15:13,360 --> 00:15:15,100
怎么了?为什么?
What? Why?

291
00:15:15,240 --> 00:15:17,980
为什么?为什么?
Why? Why?

292
00:15:18,400 --> 00:15:19,930
为什么?!
Why?!

293
00:15:21,580 --> 00:15:23,550
- 为什么?! - 我来告诉你们!
- Why?! - Let me tell it.

294
00:15:23,580 --> 00:15:26,410
去年交通系统罢工的时候
It was last year during the transit strike.

295
00:15:26,946 --> 00:15:28,063
- Hey. - Hey.

296
00:15:28,090 --> 00:15:29,380
马修在吗?
Uh, is Marshall around?

297
00:15:29,410 --> 00:15:32,140
我半个小时后要去皇后区按摩 我需要他送我一程
I have a massage in Queens in half an hour. I need a ride.

298
00:15:32,170 --> 00:15:34,680
他一整天都在图书馆 钥匙在那...
Uh, no, he's at the library all day. Just take the keys.

299
00:15:36,170 --> 00:15:38,410
你为什么不开车送送我呢
Hey! Why don't you drive me?

300
00:15:38,440 --> 00:15:40,120
你也可以顺便兜兜风
It'll be like a total road trip.

301
00:15:40,150 --> 00:15:41,390
到皇后区兜风?
To Queens?

302
00:15:41,420 --> 00:15:44,840
我们可以买点牛肉干 饼干
Yeah, we'll get, we'll get beef jerky, Triscuits.

303
00:15:44,870 --> 00:15:47,410
但我还有好多事情做
Uh, actually I have a lot of work to do, so.

304
00:15:47,440 --> 00:15:50,470
那好吧 我去取消按摩
Okay. Well, anyway, I'll cancel.

305
00:15:50,500 --> 00:15:52,180
- 再见 - 等等
- See you later. - Wait!

306
00:15:54,300 --> 00:15:55,810
你知道怎么开车吧 不是吗？
You know how to drive, right?

307
00:15:55,840 --> 00:15:59,450
当然知道了 我热爱驾驶
What, of course I know how to drive. I love driving.

308
00:15:59,850 --> 00:16:01,340
在公路上飞驰
Hitting the road.

309
00:16:01,700 --> 00:16:03,610
在小路上漫游
Cruising the lanes.

310
00:16:04,300 --> 00:16:05,590
还有刹车
And braking.

311
00:16:05,690 --> 00:16:07,550
鸣笛 爱死了
Honking. Love it.

312
00:16:08,170 --> 00:16:10,100
除了女驾驶员
Except for lady drivers.

313
00:16:10,290 --> 00:16:12,930
别让我碰到女驾驶员
Don't get me started on lady drivers.

314
00:16:12,960 --> 00:16:14,850
- 那个踏板是油门? - 你想骗我？
- Which pedal's the gas? - Trick question.

315
00:16:14,880 --> 00:16:15,770
- 不是 - 是
- No, it's not. - Yes, it is.

316
00:16:15,800 --> 00:16:18,000
- 不是 - 中间 左边 还是右边
- No, it's not. - Middle, left, right?

317
00:16:19,540 --> 00:16:21,580
我没学过怎么开车
I never learned how to drive!

318
00:16:21,610 --> 00:16:24,000
我在城市里长大的 没机会
I grew up in the city. I never had a chance.

319
00:16:24,030 --> 00:16:25,050
你知道吗
Well, guess what?

320
00:16:25,080 --> 00:16:27,350
你有机会学了 因为我来教你
You're getting your chance. Because I'm going to teach you.

321
00:16:27,380 --> 00:16:30,060
巴尼・斯蒂森 系安全带
Barney Stinson, buckle up.

322
00:16:32,630 --> 00:16:33,980
别这样了
This isn't right.

323
00:16:34,010 --> 00:16:36,950
老天决不会允许我们 用这么快的速度来开车的
God never meant for us to travel at such breakneck speeds.

324
00:16:37,080 --> 00:16:39,600
放松点 你做得挺好的
Relax. You're doing great.

325
00:16:39,740 --> 00:16:42,560
别看那的那个老太太 这不是比赛
Ignore the old lady on the rascal; this isn't a race.

326
00:16:44,260 --> 00:16:45,890
兄弟 一条狗
Dude, a dog.

327
00:16:45,920 --> 00:16:48,040
Zitch dogs...他不懂
Zitch dogs, this. Or nothing.

328
00:16:48,620 --> 00:16:50,420
我应该怎么办?告诉我干嘛 泰德
What do I do? Tell me what to do, Ted.

329
00:16:50,450 --> 00:16:53,320
踩刹车 二十分钟内踩都来得及
Step on the brakes. Sometime in the next 20 minutes.

330
00:16:53,350 --> 00:16:55,000
哪个啊? 哪个是刹车?
Which? Which one's the break again?

331
00:16:55,030 --> 00:16:57,080
- 左边那个 - 左边 左边
- The left one. - Left. Oh, man, left.

332
00:16:57,110 --> 00:16:58,960
- 我大脑一片空白 - 手成L型
- I'm totally blanking. - Make the Ls.

333
00:16:58,990 --> 00:17:00,770
我们停不下来了啊
Oh, we're not going to make it.

334
00:17:02,300 --> 00:17:04,150
为什么打开收音机啊?
Why did you just turn on the radio?

335
00:17:04,180 --> 00:17:05,620
我也不知道为什么打开啊
I don't know why I turned on the radio!

336
00:17:05,650 --> 00:17:07,500
我们要死了 告诉我怎么办 泰德
We're going to die. Tell me what to do, Ted.

337
00:17:07,530 --> 00:17:08,900
放松点 你太紧张了
Relax. You're being crazy.

338
00:17:08,930 --> 00:17:11,170
- 帮帮我 泰德! 我说真的 - 刹车 换档 转向
- Help me, Ted! I'm being serious. - Stop, drop and roll.

339
00:17:14,360 --> 00:17:17,920
尖叫真爽! 尖叫真爽!
Screaming is fun! Screaming is fun!

340
00:17:27,600 --> 00:17:28,780
我不能动了
I can't move.

341
00:17:28,890 --> 00:17:31,680
我不能 我失去...知觉
I can't... I can't feel my...

342
00:17:32,220 --> 00:17:33,380
等等
Wait.

343
00:17:34,550 --> 00:17:35,770
等等
Wait.

344
00:17:39,800 --> 00:17:41,240
我们没事
We're okay.

345
00:17:41,580 --> 00:17:43,110
- 我们没事 - 我们没事
- We're okay. - We're okay.

346
00:17:43,140 --> 00:17:45,390
真是个奇迹 泰德!
It's a miracle, Ted!

347
00:17:46,570 --> 00:17:50,380
看起来你在车里发生不止一次事故了
Wow. Sounds like you had some accident in that car.

348
00:17:50,410 --> 00:17:52,860
确切说 他有两次事故如果加上他...
Actually, he had two accidents if you add the fact that he...

349
00:17:52,897 --> 00:17:55,071
ummina-hummina-hummina-hummina ummina-hummina-hummina-hummina.

350
00:17:57,010 --> 00:17:59,810
我都不可能 在这如果不是那次事故
I shouldn't even be here, thanks to that deathtrap.

351
00:17:59,840 --> 00:18:01,260
但是天意...
But fate...

352
00:18:01,290 --> 00:18:03,800
天意给了我第二次机会
fate gave me a second chance.

353
00:18:03,830 --> 00:18:08,030
让我意识到我们 在世上的时间太少了 不能浪费
And helped me realize that our days on this planet are too few to squander.

354
00:18:08,350 --> 00:18:11,120
所以我决定从现在开始
So I decided from that moment on

355
00:18:11,150 --> 00:18:15,140
尽情的继续生活
to continue living life to its fullest.

356
00:18:15,170 --> 00:18:19,730
我作了一个终生不变的决定 就是绝不改变生活方式
So you made a life-changing decision to not change your life at all.

357
00:18:19,760 --> 00:18:21,120
是这样的
True story.

358
00:18:22,230 --> 00:18:23,460
朋友们
Guys.

359
00:18:23,490 --> 00:18:25,900
这辆菲奥雷对我们意味着太多
This Fiero's meant a lot to all of us.

360
00:18:25,930 --> 00:18:27,680
友谊的建立
Friendships were made.

361
00:18:27,710 --> 00:18:30,390
冒险的经历 可怕的事故
Adventures had. Horrors faced.

362
00:18:32,430 --> 00:18:33,920
就是我们要解脱它的原因
That's why we have to get rid of it.

363
00:18:33,950 --> 00:18:35,200
- 是的! - 什么?
- Yes! - What?

364
00:18:35,230 --> 00:18:38,610
它有着精彩的过去 现在它需要的是骄傲的死去
It's lived a great life and it deserves to die with dignity.

365
00:18:38,640 --> 00:18:40,240
但是200,000英里
But 200,000...

366
00:18:40,270 --> 00:18:42,780
这就是生活 你知道吗?
But that's life. You know?

367
00:18:42,810 --> 00:18:45,230
你不知道你将会怎么样
You never end up where you thought you wanted to be.

368
00:18:45,260 --> 00:18:46,830
我不是瞎起哄
I'm not helping the environment.

369
00:18:46,860 --> 00:18:48,390
泰德没有成为哲学家
Ted's not a philosopher.

370
00:18:48,420 --> 00:18:50,050
莉莉没有成为享誉世界的艺术家
Lily's not not a world-famous artist.

371
00:18:50,080 --> 00:18:52,920
巴尼开一个小时车也没到10英里
Barney's never driven more than ten miles an hour.

372
00:18:52,950 --> 00:18:56,560
罗宾 我肯定 她的生活也有沮丧的经历
Robin, I'm sure, has also experienced disappointment in her life.

373
00:18:56,590 --> 00:18:57,530
也许?
Maybe?

374
00:18:57,560 --> 00:19:01,630
我的菲奥雷 不是一个简单的 开了200,000英里的菲奥雷
And my Fiero's not a Fiero that went 200,000 miles.

375
00:19:02,400 --> 00:19:04,910
没什么 你们知道吗?
It's okay. You know?

376
00:19:05,190 --> 00:19:06,840
它们都是过去的梦想了
Those are old dreams.

377
00:19:07,980 --> 00:19:11,800
我们买个新车 开始新的生活
We'll get a new car and we'll fill that one up with new memories.

378
00:19:11,970 --> 00:19:14,730
我们结婚的时候会是这辆车
And that'll be the car we had when we were first married.

379
00:19:14,780 --> 00:19:17,060
当我们有了自己的房子 是这辆车
When we owned our first house.

380
00:19:17,350 --> 00:19:20,010
甚至当我们有四个孩子了 还是这辆车
Maybe even the first car our four kids remember.

381
00:19:20,040 --> 00:19:22,100
太好了
That's so sweet.

382
00:19:22,130 --> 00:19:24,900
但最好我们是头两个孩子记住的车
The first car our two kids remember.

383
00:19:26,360 --> 00:19:28,930
我想说再见了
I would like to say good-bye.

384
00:19:47,360 --> 00:19:48,630
你知道吗?
You know what?

385
00:19:48,660 --> 00:19:50,770
这辆菲奥雷 影响了我们的生活
This Fiero, it's effected all our lives.

386
00:19:50,800 --> 00:19:52,030
- 是影响(发音不一样) - 我是说影响
- Affected. - That's what I said.

387
00:19:52,060 --> 00:19:53,440
只是确认一下
Just making sure.

388
00:19:53,470 --> 00:19:55,450
这辆车带我们去了很多地方
Got us all a lot of places.

389
00:19:55,480 --> 00:19:57,740
我想现在是我们该帮帮它的时候了
I mean maybe it's time we return the favor.

390
00:19:57,770 --> 00:20:00,170
我们应该让它跑到200,000英里
This Fiero should have made it to 200,000.

391
00:20:00,200 --> 00:20:02,100
让我们把它推出去
So, let's get it out that door.

392
00:20:02,130 --> 00:20:04,310
我们推完最后.7英里
And we'll push it the last .7 miles.

393
00:20:04,340 --> 00:20:06,110
对我们也意义非凡
It'd do the same for us.

394
00:20:23,630 --> 00:20:25,100
嘿 天才们
Hey, geniuses.

395
00:20:25,130 --> 00:20:28,500
后轮锁上了 车根本动不了
The back wheels are on blocks. That car ain't going anywhere.

396
00:20:31,080 --> 00:20:33,870
- 到此为止! - 到此为止!
- Close enough! - Close enough!

397
00:20:34,780 --> 00:20:37,160
就这样马修 跟他的菲奥雷说再见了
And so Marshall said good-bye to his Fiero.

398
00:20:37,190 --> 00:20:39,250
而那辆车还给了我们最后的礼物
And as the car's final gift to us all,

399
00:20:39,280 --> 00:20:43,330
我们在接下来的两天 在酒吧消费零部件所卖的钱
the money he got for scrap parts paid our bar tab for the next two nights.

400
00:20:43,360 --> 00:20:45,100
再会  菲奥雷! (意大利语)
Arrivederci, Fiero!

401
00:20:45,130 --> 00:20:47,670
你给了车中的无私奉献者
You were the freaking giving tree of cars.

402
00:20:47,700 --> 00:20:49,570
祝你安静的离开
May you rust in peace.

403
00:20:49,660 --> 00:20:52,160
下地狱吧 魔鬼
Rot in hell, devil steed.

404
00:20:53,460 --> 00:20:56,140
还有比那样更好的朋友吗?
And what better friend is there than that?

405
00:21:01,300 --> 00:21:03,610
兄弟 听过这首歌吗?
Bro. Have you heard this new song?

406
00:21:03,640 --> 00:21:05,150
我刚拿到的卡带
I just got the cassingle.

407
00:21:05,180 --> 00:21:06,320
放进去吧
Put it in.

408
00:21:10,270 --> 00:21:12,760
我永远不会厌倦这首歌
I am never going to get sick of this song.

409
00:21:12,900 --> 00:21:15,850
绝不 绝不
Never, ever, never, never, ever.

410
00:21:16,028 --> 00:21:17,643
Yeah!
