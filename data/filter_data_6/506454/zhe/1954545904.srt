1
00:00:22,669 --> 00:00:28,295

2
00:00:32,503 --> 00:00:38,877

3
00:00:41,139 --> 00:00:46,505

4
00:01:10,142 --> 00:01:15,381

5
00:04:50,120 --> 00:04:52,110
噢 对不起 福尔摩斯
Oh, sorry Holmes.

6
00:04:52,267 --> 00:04:53,319
不 不
No, no,

7
00:04:55,468 --> 00:04:57,239
你来得正是时候
you couldn't have come at a better time.

8
00:04:57,836 --> 00:04:59,938
我怕你正忙呢
I was afraid you were engaged.

9
00:05:00,034 --> 00:05:02,013
是的 非常忙
I am, very much so.

10
00:05:02,097 --> 00:05:05,296
华生医生和我一样 热衷于稀奇古怪的东西
Dr. Watson shares my love of all that is bizarre,

11
00:05:05,756 --> 00:05:08,152
而不是日常生活中那些稀松平常的老套故事
but outside the routine of everyday existence.

12
00:05:09,154 --> 00:05:11,476
现在还不能断定
It is at present and impossible to say

13
00:05:11,271 --> 00:05:13,657
这个案子是否属于犯罪案件
that this case is an instance of crime or no.

14
00:05:14,366 --> 00:05:16,053
但是足以说
But suffice it to say that I know as little

15
00:05:16,138 --> 00:05:18,138
对于杰贝斯・威尔逊先生 我和你知道的一样少
about Mr. Jay Beards Wilson as you do yourself,

16
00:05:18,390 --> 00:05:19,994
除了一些明显的事实外
beyond the obvious facts.

17
00:05:20,350 --> 00:05:23,122
他干过一阵儿体力活
That he has done manual labor at sometime.

18
00:05:23,509 --> 00:05:25,645
曾经去过中国
But it takes staff that he has been to China.

19
00:05:25,874 --> 00:05:27,280
他最近还...
And that he has done

20
00:05:27,480 --> 00:05:29,010
写过不少东西
a considerable amount of writing lately.

21
00:05:29,012 --> 00:05:30,877
噢!我的老天爷!
How in the name of good fortune

22
00:05:31,138 --> 00:05:33,409
您怎么知道的?福尔摩斯先生
did you know all that Mr. Holmes?

23
00:05:33,776 --> 00:05:36,277
真像福音一样确切 我是干过体力活
As true as gospel I once did manual labor.

24
00:05:36,477 --> 00:05:38,866
我曾在船上做过木匠
I started off as a ship's carpenter.

25
00:05:38,905 --> 00:05:40,209
你的手 我的好仆人
Your hands my good servant.

26
00:05:40,397 --> 00:05:41,492
你右手的肌肉
The muscles of your right hand

27
00:05:41,658 --> 00:05:42,904
比左手的发达
are more developed than the left.

28
00:05:43,460 --> 00:05:44,866
那写作呢?
And the writing?

29
00:05:45,910 --> 00:05:47,170
还有别的什么更能说明问题吗?
What else could be indicated.

30
00:05:47,462 --> 00:05:49,702
右手袖子足有五寸长的地方 磨得油光发亮
By the right cuffs are very shiny for five inches.

31
00:05:49,944 --> 00:05:54,342
左胳膊肘那儿打了个整洁的补丁
And the left sleeve with smooth pattern over the elbow

32
00:05:54,603 --> 00:05:57,875
这是经常贴在桌面所致... 但中国?
where you lean it on the desk... but China?

33
00:05:58,011 --> 00:06:01,513
右手腕正上方的鱼状纹身
The fish tattooed immediately above his right wrist.

34
00:06:01,838 --> 00:06:04,824
我对纹身略有研究 威尔逊先生
I have made a small study of tattoo marks,Mr. Wilson, 

35
00:06:04,952 --> 00:06:06,663
我还写过...
and have even contributed to the

36
00:06:06,744 --> 00:06:08,189
这方面的文章
 literature of the subject.

37
00:06:08,415 --> 00:06:10,499
染鱼鳞的绝技
That trick of staining the fish scales,

38
00:06:10,812 --> 00:06:12,802
使用淡淡的粉红色 是中国才有的
a delicate pink is quite peculiar to China.

39
00:06:13,168 --> 00:06:15,001
还有 我看见一枚中国钱币
Wherein addition I see a Chinese coin hanging

40
00:06:15,232 --> 00:06:16,409
垂在他的表链上
from his watch chain.

41
00:06:16,764 --> 00:06:18,222
这岂不是显然易见的吗
The matter becomes even more simple.

42
00:06:18,505 --> 00:06:20,005
哈哈 真没想到...
Well I never...

43
00:06:20,320 --> 00:06:22,080
起初我还觉得你真是神机妙算
I thought at first it was something clever,

44
00:06:22,216 --> 00:06:25,092
说穿了 也没什么了不起
but now I see there's nothing in it after all.

45
00:06:29,607 --> 00:06:31,826
我开始觉得要是心眼太实
You know I begin to think that my reputation

46
00:06:32,025 --> 00:06:34,380
会毁了自己的名声
such as it is will suffer shipwreck if I'm so candid

47
00:06:34,517 --> 00:06:37,758
"不为人知者乃为壮丽"
omne ignotum pro magnifico.

48
00:06:39,437 --> 00:06:42,803
解释之后 一切都变得平庸
Everything becomes commonplace by explanation.

49
00:06:43,210 --> 00:06:45,596
华生 这么翻译太不严谨了
Watson that is a very loose translation.

50
00:06:45,837 --> 00:06:48,171
哦 请把那则广告给医生看
Oh, please show the doctor that advertisement.

51
00:06:48,517 --> 00:06:51,205
哦 在这儿 您自己看吧 先生
Oh, there, you can read it for yourself sir.

52
00:06:54,219 --> 00:06:55,990
红发会
To the Red Headed League.

53
00:06:59,086 --> 00:07:00,429
由于原住于美国宾夕法尼亚州的
On account of the request

54
00:07:00,639 --> 00:07:03,327
黎巴嫩人

薪金为每周四镑
which entitles a member of the league to a salary

57
00:07:09,500 --> 00:07:12,741
工作则实系挂名而已
of four pounds a week for purely nominal services.

58
00:07:13,815 --> 00:07:17,171
凡红发男性 身体健康 智力健全

62
00:07:28,794 --> 00:07:31,097
红发会办公室邓肯・罗斯处提出申请
7 Copes Court Fleet Street.

63
00:07:31,432 --> 00:07:32,556
此事当真?
Is this serious?

64
00:07:34,308 --> 00:07:36,934
这则广告有点不合常理 华生
It is a little off the beaten track, hey Watson.

65
00:07:37,196 --> 00:07:40,760
麻烦你记下报纸名和日期
Oh, would you make a note of the paper and the date?

66
00:07:42,054 --> 00:07:44,815
<纪事年报> 4月27日 星期六
Evening standard of Saturday the 27th of April,

67
00:07:45,307 --> 00:07:46,442
两个月前
two months ago.

68
00:07:46,588 --> 00:07:47,660
请坐下
Do try this sitting.

69
00:07:47,777 --> 00:07:51,299
现在 威尔逊先生 请说吧
Now, Mr. Wilson, off you go

70
00:07:51,477 --> 00:07:53,717
简略地介绍一下你自己
at scratch and tell us all about yourself.

71
00:07:54,448 --> 00:07:58,909
嗯 先生们 我开了个
Oh, well gentlemen I have a small

72
00:07:59,087 --> 00:08:01,775
小当铺 在萨克斯科伯格广场
pawn broking business in Sax Coburg Street,

73
00:08:02,006 --> 00:08:03,026
在市区附近
near the city.

74
00:08:03,235 --> 00:08:04,995
买卖做得不大
It's not a very large affair.

75
00:08:05,268 --> 00:08:06,695
只能勉强维持生计
It just gives me a living.

76
00:08:07,103 --> 00:08:11,314
过去我还能请两个伙计 但现在只雇得起一个
I used to keep two assistants but now I just keep the one.

77
00:08:11,554 --> 00:08:15,723
实话实说 我原打算付全部工钱
And to tell you the truth I'd have a job to make you pay

78
00:08:16,255 --> 00:08:18,339
但这个伙计 自愿拿一半工资
but the deeds willing to come at half wages

79
00:08:18,549 --> 00:08:20,205
说是为了学做生意
so as to learn the business.

80
00:08:21,081 --> 00:08:23,238
大约两个月前...
About two months ago...

81
00:08:23,552 --> 00:08:26,199
这个热心肠的小伙子叫什么?
What is the name of the obliging youth?

82
00:08:26,585 --> 00:08:28,127
文森特・斯波尔丁
Vincent Spalding.

83
00:08:28,472 --> 00:08:31,025
但他算不上是个小伙子 福尔摩斯先生
Oh, but he's not such a youth either Mr. Holmes.

84
00:08:31,213 --> 00:08:32,869
我不太清楚他的年纪
It's difficult to say his age

85
00:08:33,038 --> 00:08:35,320
可我再也找不到比这个 更精明能干的伙计了
but I couldn't wish for a smarter assistant.

86
00:08:35,665 --> 00:08:38,041
你的运气真不赖!
You seem most remarkably fortunate.

87
00:08:38,792 --> 00:08:41,605
以低于市价的工钱雇到伙计
In having an employee who comes under the market price,

88
00:08:41,763 --> 00:08:43,190
不知道你那个伙计
I don't know that your assistant

89
00:08:43,399 --> 00:08:45,086
是不是同那则广告 一样非比寻常?
is not as remarkable as your advertisement.

90
00:08:45,954 --> 00:08:47,506
哦 他也有缺点
Oh, but he does have his faults.

91
00:08:48,423 --> 00:08:50,882
他比谁都爱照相
However, he was such a fellow for photography.

92
00:08:51,051 --> 00:08:52,759
整天拿着相机到处拍照
Always snapping away with his camera

93
00:08:52,959 --> 00:08:55,845
不愿在工作上动脑筋 然后钻进...
when he should be improving his mind and then diving down

94
00:08:56,221 --> 00:08:58,346
地下室去冲洗那些东西
into the cellar to develop the wretched things.

95
00:08:58,598 --> 00:09:00,723
但是 总的来说 他算是个好伙计
Still on the whole he's a good worker.

96
00:09:00,974 --> 00:09:02,255
没什么坏心眼
No vice in him.

97
00:09:02,434 --> 00:09:04,945
当初就是他 把广告拿给我看的
It was he who first showed me the advertisement.

98
00:09:17,673 --> 00:09:20,069
但愿我是红头发 威尔逊先生
I wish to the lord I was a red headed man Mr. Wilson.

99
00:09:20,822 --> 00:09:21,905
为什么?
Why is that?

100
00:09:22,990 --> 00:09:24,427
现在红发会里
Well there's another vacancy

101
00:09:24,710 --> 00:09:25,834
又有职位空缺了
in the League of Red Headed Men.

102
00:09:27,066 --> 00:09:28,243
从未听过这事儿
I've never heard of it.

103
00:09:30,287 --> 00:09:34,438
我还纳闷呢 您本人就非常符合资格
Well, I'd wonder at that you being so eligible yourself.

104
00:09:35,749 --> 00:09:37,562
薪金相当可观
Nice money too.

105
00:09:38,418 --> 00:09:41,284
一年200镑 活儿又轻松...
A couple hundred a year and the work's light...

106
00:09:46,100 --> 00:09:48,590
到时可得有成千上万的 红发人去应聘吧
Oh, there'll be thousands of red headed men apply.

107
00:09:48,706 --> 00:09:50,654
我可不这么认为 先生
Oh, well I doubt that sir.

108
00:09:51,062 --> 00:09:52,739
没人有你这么火红的头发...
Well nobody with such a fine fiery color

109
00:09:52,865 --> 00:09:54,208
如同上天恩赐一般 威尔逊先生
as you're blessed with Mr. Wilson.

110
00:09:57,368 --> 00:09:59,389
但是我想还是不值得
But then I suppose it's only worth your while

111
00:09:59,704 --> 00:10:00,797
为了那几百英镑
to put yourself out of the way

112
00:10:01,100 --> 00:10:02,944
特地跑一趟吧
for sake of a few hundred pounds.

113
00:10:04,123 --> 00:10:06,113
是的 先生
Yes, sir.

114
00:10:10,065 --> 00:10:13,056
嗯 我很爱呆在家里
Well I'm very much of a stay at home sort of person.

115
00:10:13,265 --> 00:10:15,974
有时候连续几个星期 我都不会踏出门口半步
Sometimes weeks on end before I put my foot over the doormat

116
00:10:16,153 --> 00:10:19,978
但这个看起来很有意思
but this it looked interesting.

117
00:10:20,906 --> 00:10:23,709
我对此很感兴趣 而年轻的文森特...
I was intrigued and young Vincent

118
00:10:24,001 --> 00:10:25,271
说他愿意陪我一起去
said he'd come with me.

119
00:10:25,523 --> 00:10:28,691
所以星期一早上 我们锁好店门
So, on Monday morning we shut up the shop

120
00:10:29,110 --> 00:10:31,684
便动身了
and off we went.

121
00:10:34,656 --> 00:10:35,916
文森特 我们回去吧
Now, Vincent let's go back

122
00:10:36,072 --> 00:10:37,155
人太多 过不去
I can't get by the crowd.

123
00:10:37,261 --> 00:10:38,187
拿出勇气 威尔逊先生
Courage Mr. Wilson.

124
00:10:38,491 --> 00:10:40,543
我们就快到了 正处在重要关头
We're so near and so much at stake.

125
00:10:40,847 --> 00:10:42,639
现在穿上外套
Now you put your coat on

126
00:10:43,297 --> 00:10:44,338
跟着我走
and come along with me.

127
00:11:01,403 --> 00:11:03,841
喂 喂 喂 请小点声
Ohy, Ohy, Ohy, a little less noise

128
00:11:04,051 --> 00:11:05,217
先生们
please gentlemen.

129
00:11:06,688 --> 00:11:10,784
这里 看这里 你什么意思?
Here, here what's your game?

130
00:11:11,160 --> 00:11:12,837
喂 滚开
Hey get out of here.

131
00:11:13,224 --> 00:11:14,150
喂...喂...
Hey, hey...

132
00:11:27,773 --> 00:11:29,658
你可以走了 你是下一个 进去吧
Off you go, you next, get in.

133
00:11:29,892 --> 00:11:31,235
嘿 你往哪儿走?
Hey, where are you going?

134
00:11:31,477 --> 00:11:32,768
这边直走 走吧
Straight this way, Come on.

135
00:11:33,009 --> 00:11:34,737
这位是威尔逊先生
This is Mr. Wilson.

136
00:11:34,739 --> 00:11:35,926
直接进去吧 威尔逊先生
Right in you go Mr. Wilson.

137
00:11:50,396 --> 00:11:52,219
非常合适
Admirably suited.

138
00:11:55,566 --> 00:11:57,222
完全符合要求
Every requirement.

139
00:12:00,205 --> 00:12:02,476
静下来了
Very quiet.

140
00:12:04,427 --> 00:12:06,917
恭喜您 威尔逊先生
Congratulations Mr. Wilson.

141
00:12:07,304 --> 00:12:09,106
再迟疑就太不对了
It would be injustice to hesitate.

142
00:12:09,702 --> 00:12:12,641
您不介意我采取谨慎措施吧?
You will I'm sure excuse me if I take an obvious precaution.

143
00:12:16,623 --> 00:12:18,415
眼泪都流出来了
Tears in your eyes.

144
00:12:18,801 --> 00:12:20,551
想必是真头发了
I perceive all is as it should be.

145
00:12:21,648 --> 00:12:23,221
我们不得不小心防范
We have to be careful.

146
00:12:23,628 --> 00:12:26,859
被假发骗过两次 被颜料骗过一次
Twice deceived by wigs, once by paint.

147
00:12:27,715 --> 00:12:29,882
还有用鞋蜡来玩花招的
I could tell you tales of cobblers wags

148
00:12:30,237 --> 00:12:33,332
您听了准会感到恶心
that would disgust you with human nature.

149
00:12:35,907 --> 00:12:37,636
我叫邓肯・罗斯
My name is Duncan Ross.

150
00:12:38,305 --> 00:12:40,399
我自己就是基金的受益人
I am myself a pension upon a fund left by

151
00:12:40,577 --> 00:12:42,139
这是一位尊贵的捐赠者遗留的
a noble benefactor.

152
00:12:43,058 --> 00:12:47,102
就知道你要问我 伊乔基亚・霍普金斯先生的事
I see you're about to question me about Mr. Ethic Guya Hopkins.

153
00:12:50,085 --> 00:12:52,075
他自己长了一头红发
He was himself red headed.

154
00:12:52,919 --> 00:12:55,357
他年轻时离开伦敦去了美国
In his youth he left London for America where he made

155
00:12:55,526 --> 00:12:57,245
赚了好几百万美元

156
00:12:57,506 --> 00:12:59,694
他死后 人们发现他曾立下遗嘱
On his death it was found that he had instructed

157
00:12:59,872 --> 00:13:06,365
吩咐财产托管人让他出生的这座城市中
a trustee in his will to make life a little easier

158
00:13:06,534 --> 00:13:09,066
生活着的红发人日子过得舒适安逸
for the red headed men in the town of his birth.

159
00:13:11,600 --> 00:13:13,371
绝妙的颜色
Wonderful color.

160
00:13:13,851 --> 00:13:15,893
您的全名叫什么?  威尔逊先生
Now what's your full name Mr. Wilson?

161
00:13:16,801 --> 00:13:18,864

163
00:13:22,941 --> 00:13:23,771
威尔逊先生?
Mr. Wilson?

164
00:13:23,877 --> 00:13:24,981
你有妻儿吗?
Do you have a family?

165
00:13:25,943 --> 00:13:27,047

No, I'm a widower.

166
00:13:27,162 --> 00:13:28,881
不 我从来就没有过什么家人
No, I never had any family.

167
00:13:31,175 --> 00:13:34,875
哎呀 真遗憾听您这么说
Oh dear, sad to hear you say that.

168
00:13:36,293 --> 00:13:37,855
本基金设立的目的就是为了...
The fund of course is for the propagation

169
00:13:38,118 --> 00:13:39,378
红发人更多地繁衍
and spread of red headed men

170
00:13:39,651 --> 00:13:41,610
延续他们的血脉
as well as with their maintenance.

171
00:13:44,956 --> 00:13:47,300
要是换了别人 这个缺点可能是不幸的
In another case the objection might be fatal.

172
00:13:49,887 --> 00:13:51,627
但我想我们得破例照顾一下
However, I've think we've got to stretch a point

173
00:13:51,889 --> 00:13:54,609
因为您的头发长得这么好
in favor of a man with such a head of hair as yours.

174
00:14:04,054 --> 00:14:05,898
空缺已经有人了
The vacancy has been filled.

175
00:14:12,059 --> 00:14:14,581

走吧
Off you go.

179
00:14:39,046 --> 00:14:43,997
您什么时候可以来上班?
Now, when would you be free to start upon your new duties?

180
00:14:44,446 --> 00:14:48,187
嗯 这事还有点不好办 因为我本身也有做买卖
Oh, well it is rather awkward as I do have a business already.

181
00:14:48,449 --> 00:14:49,730
什么时候上班?
What would be the hours?

182
00:14:49,898 --> 00:14:51,179
上午10点到下午2点

183
00:14:51,587 --> 00:14:53,076

184
00:14:53,234 --> 00:14:54,817

185
00:14:55,141 --> 00:14:56,714

没错
Correct.

188
00:15:01,041 --> 00:15:02,051
干些什么活?
And the work?

189
00:15:02,146 --> 00:15:03,333
纯属挂名
Purely nominal.

190
00:15:03,428 --> 00:15:04,970
纯属挂名是什么意思?
Yes, but what do you call purely nominal?

191
00:15:06,774 --> 00:15:08,962
就是说您必须待在办公室里
Well, you have to stay in the office

192
00:15:09,224 --> 00:15:11,214
至少在工作时间内呆在这栋楼里
or at least in the building the whole time.

193
00:15:11,393 --> 00:15:13,800
一旦离开 便会 永远丢掉这个职位

195
00:15:16,062 --> 00:15:17,353
噢 我不会离开的
Oh, I shouldn't dream of leaving.

196
00:15:17,501 --> 00:15:18,907
任何借口都没用
No, excuse will avail.

197
00:15:18,991 --> 00:15:20,668
不管是生病 有事  还是其他原因都不行
Not a sickness, business, anything else.

198
00:15:20,795 --> 00:15:24,787
您必须待在这里 否则会丢掉这份工作
Here you will remain or else lose your ability.

199
00:15:25,100 --> 00:15:27,465
哦 我清楚明白了
Oh, I am quite clear on that point.

200
00:15:27,664 --> 00:15:29,560
具体的工作内容是什么呢?
But what exactly is the work?

201
00:15:31,542 --> 00:15:34,700
您的工作是抄写<大英百科全书>
It is to copy out the encyclopedia Britannica.

202
00:15:37,025 --> 00:15:38,681
这是第一卷

204
00:15:41,163 --> 00:15:43,101
我们只提供桌椅
We will supply this desk and chair.

205
00:15:43,978 --> 00:15:47,469
下星期一能开始上班吗?
Now would you be free to start next Monday morning?

206
00:15:49,138 --> 00:15:50,356
是的 当然可以
Oh, yes, certainly.

207
00:15:51,920 --> 00:15:55,057
那么再次祝贺您
Then once again my congratulations

208
00:15:55,507 --> 00:15:58,435
杰贝斯・威尔逊先生 得到这个重要职务
Mr. Jay Beards Wilson on the most important position

209
00:15:58,644 --> 00:16:00,530

干得非常好!
Well done indeed.

214
00:16:16,827 --> 00:16:18,309
这条路最近 先生
This is the quickest way out sir.

215
00:16:18,429 --> 00:16:19,335
哦
Oh.

216
00:16:19,701 --> 00:16:20,825
这边走
This way.

217
00:16:28,843 --> 00:16:30,572
我回到家仔细一想
When I got home the whole thing seemed

218
00:16:30,813 --> 00:16:33,376
整件事情太荒谬了
on reflection to be quite ridiculous.

219
00:16:34,013 --> 00:16:34,929
为什么?
Why?

220
00:16:35,004 --> 00:16:36,691
谁会立下这样不寻常的遗嘱呢?
Who would make such an extraordinary will?

221
00:16:37,182 --> 00:16:39,214
一个如此慷慨的百万富翁
Not a very generous millionaire to make you

222
00:16:39,298 --> 00:16:41,767
竟让你自备笔墨纸砚
buy your own pen, ink, and paper.

223
00:16:41,873 --> 00:16:44,082
就是说嘛 福尔摩斯先生
Exactly Mr. Holmes.

224
00:16:44,990 --> 00:16:48,554
很快我便说服自己 这一定是个大骗局
I soon persuaded myself it was some great hoax or fraud.

225
00:16:49,878 --> 00:16:53,588
但到了星期一早上 又觉得只有笨蛋才会
And then when Monday morning came along it seemed stupid

226
00:16:53,778 --> 00:16:55,455
拒绝这样的好工作
to turn down a good job

227
00:16:55,570 --> 00:16:59,645
所以 我去买了一瓶 一个便士的墨水
so, off I went and bought a penny bottle of ink

228
00:16:59,771 --> 00:17:03,179
一只羽毛笔和七张大书写纸
and a pen and seven sheets of fools kept paper.

229
00:17:03,805 --> 00:17:06,796
前往教皇院
And I set off for Popes Core.

230
00:17:24,841 --> 00:17:27,081
早上好 威尔逊先生 欢迎您
Good morning, Mr. Wilson and welcome.

231
00:17:27,249 --> 00:17:28,029
早上好
Good morning.

232
00:17:29,615 --> 00:17:32,095
让我又惊又喜的是
Well to my surprise and delight

233
00:17:32,419 --> 00:17:35,149
一切都很顺利
everything was as right as possible.

234
00:17:35,588 --> 00:17:37,171
桌椅都摆好了
The table was set up ready for me

235
00:17:37,391 --> 00:17:41,602
邓肯・罗斯先生也在那儿 等我了解工作内容后
and Mr. Duncan Ross was there to see I got fairly to work.

236
00:17:43,208 --> 00:17:45,177
我的工作也就真正开始了
My employment had truly begun.

237
00:17:46,585 --> 00:17:47,981
每天都是如此
The schedule never varied.

238
00:17:48,212 --> 00:17:51,755
从早上10点开始干活 下午2点离开
My work started at 10:00 and ended at 2:00

239
00:17:52,798 --> 00:17:55,132
12点半的时候有一小段时间吃午餐
with a small break for my lunch at half past 12:00.

240
00:17:56,665 --> 00:18:00,260
每星期六下午2点 罗斯先生都会过来
Every Saturday at 2:00 Mr. Ross would come in

241
00:18:00,512 --> 00:18:02,637
发给我一个星期的薪水
and give me my money.

242
00:18:02,784 --> 00:18:04,680
称赞我抄写得真不赖
Compliment me upon the amount that I'd written

243
00:18:04,900 --> 00:18:06,462
然后我们一起离开
and then we'd both leave.

244
00:18:06,704 --> 00:18:09,278
最后罗斯先生把门锁上
Mr. Ross locking the door afterwards.

245
00:18:09,455 --> 00:18:12,196
我发现朝鲜蓟非常迷人
The artichokes I found were positively fascinating.

246
00:18:12,291 --> 00:18:14,552
他们也开花
They have a kind of a bloom on them but...

247
00:18:14,959 --> 00:18:18,513
我觉得很有趣...
I thought that was very interesting...

248
00:18:19,796 --> 00:18:21,577
再回
Good Morning.

249
00:18:29,543 --> 00:18:32,440

以字母A开头的词条了 期望通过不懈努力

早日抄到B开头的词条 但今天早上

整件事情突然结束了

我像往常一样去上班 发现门关着 锁了
I went to my work as usual but the door was shut

抱怨这个极不寻常的红发会
any great grievance against this extraordinary league.

00:21:31,212 --> 00:21:33,973
正好相反 您倒赚不少钱
On the contrary you've been very well paid to say nothing

300
00:21:34,132 --> 00:21:37,050
更不用说您长了见识

301
00:21:37,217 --> 00:21:39,499
熟知了全部字母A为首的词条
on every subject under the letter A.

302
00:21:39,979 --> 00:21:43,856
是的 但他们为什么要对我开这个大玩笑?
Yes, but what's the object of them playing this prank on me?

303

308

因为他勤快 要的工钱也低
Well he was handy and would come cheap.

312

瘦高个子
Oh, well he's tall, slightly built

316
00:22:30,327 --> 00:22:32,160

320
00:22:48,205 --> 00:22:49,455
有戴耳环用的穿孔?

有 有 他说一个吉普赛人

他还在你那里?

00:22:56,888 --> 00:22:58,211
是的 我刚离开他不久
Yes, I just left him.

00:22:58,941 --> 00:23:01,775
威尔逊先生 你会在店里吧?
Mr. Wilson, You will be at your shop

326
00:23:02,318 --> 00:23:03,442
我找你的时候
if I should need you?

327
00:23:03,486 --> 00:23:05,789
我想过晚餐的时候歇业休息
Well I had thought of shutting up shop

328
00:23:05,957 --> 00:23:08,155
因为文森特建议我
at dinner time today because Vincent had suggested

329
00:23:08,344 --> 00:23:09,500
去巴金与我妹妹
I spend the rest of the weekend

330
00:23:09,647 --> 00:23:11,220

整件事令我 精神极度紧张
This whole business has upset my nerves very much.

祝你今天过得愉快 威尔逊先生
Good day to you Mr. Wilson.

339
00:23:44,369 --> 00:23:45,525
华生 你怎么看?
What do you make of it all Watson?

340
00:23:46,371 --> 00:23:47,641
我什么也没看出来
I make nothing of it.

341
00:23:48,560 --> 00:23:50,581
这事儿太玄乎了
Most mysterious business.

342
00:23:50,874 --> 00:23:52,551
但是还有更大的阴谋
Yet there are graver issues

343
00:23:54,710 --> 00:23:56,721
隐藏在这件事情背后
hanging from this affair then that first had appeared.

344
00:24:03,175 --> 00:24:04,477
接下来你打算怎么办?
What are you going to do?

345
00:24:05,686 --> 00:24:06,894
抽烟
To smoke.

346
00:24:08,053 --> 00:24:10,283
得抽三斗烟的时间才能解决
It is quite a three pipe problem

347
00:24:11,378 --> 00:24:13,816
50分钟内请不要和我搭话
and I beg that you won't speak to me for 50 minutes.

348
00:24:38,908 --> 00:24:40,992
红发会事件
The business of the Red Headed League

349
00:24:41,149 --> 00:24:42,357
已经结束了 先生
is concluded sir.

350

好
Good.

353
00:25:28,026 --> 00:25:29,222
来 华生
Come Watson.

354
00:25:29,224 --> 00:25:30,359
啊?
Huh?

355
00:25:44,632 --> 00:25:46,340
劳驾
Excuse me.

356
00:25:46,820 --> 00:25:48,685
请问从这儿到河滨大街怎么走?
Can you tell me the way to the Strand from here?

357
00:25:49,739 --> 00:25:52,563
在第三个路口右拐 到第四个路口左拐 先生
Uh, third right, fourth left sir.

358
00:25:52,918 --> 00:25:54,480
谢谢
Thank you.

359
00:25:58,276 --> 00:25:59,056
福尔摩斯?
Holmes?

360
00:25:59,121 --> 00:26:01,038
福尔摩斯 我都可以告诉你
Holmes, I could have told you that.

361
00:26:01,175 --> 00:26:02,331
毫无疑问 华生
No doubt, Watson.

362
00:26:03,801 --> 00:26:04,873
怎么了?
What is it?

363
00:26:07,002 --> 00:26:09,784
你为何用手杖敲人行道?
And why did you beat the pavement with your stick?

364
00:26:09,930 --> 00:26:13,088
华生 我们在敌人的领地侦察
Watson we are spies in an enemy's territory.

365
00:26:43,141 --> 00:26:44,005
这是我的爱好
It's a hobby of mine

366
00:26:44,194 --> 00:26:46,007
熟悉伦敦每一次细微的地方
to have an exact knowledge of London.

367
00:26:46,165 --> 00:26:48,707
这里有一家莫蒂麦烟草店
Now there's Mortimore's, the tobacconist.

368
00:26:49,312 --> 00:26:50,927
一个小售报摊
The little newspaper shop.

369
00:26:51,564 --> 00:26:53,272
城市和郊区银行的科伯格分行
Coburg Branch, the City and Suburban Bank.

370
00:26:53,576 --> 00:26:55,931
麦克法兰马车制造厂
McFarland's Carriage Building Depot

371
00:26:56,411 --> 00:26:58,244
转角处有一家素食店
and the vegetarian restaurant around the corner.

372
00:26:59,194 --> 00:27:01,830
华生 想想刚才的情景 我们有可能
Watson commit to memory, it's just possible

373
00:27:01,999 --> 00:27:03,468
正被人监视着
that we're being observed.

374
00:27:19,146 --> 00:27:21,324
一个大罪案即将发生
A considerable crime's in contemplation.

375
00:27:23,138 --> 00:27:25,514
今天是星期六 在某程度上使事情更为复杂
Today being Saturday somewhat complicates matters.

376
00:27:27,829 --> 00:27:31,466
但是现在 医生... 工作已经完成
But now doctor... our work is done.

377
00:27:31,812 --> 00:27:33,333
是时候消遣了
It is time we had some play.

378
00:27:33,583 --> 00:27:36,000
萨拉萨蒂(西班牙小提琴家)下午在 圣詹姆斯会堂表演
Sarasate's playing at Sir James Hall this afternoon.

379
00:27:36,919 --> 00:27:38,565
先来份三明治和一杯咖啡?
A sandwich and a cup of coffee?

380
00:27:38,785 --> 00:27:40,504
然后去小提琴演奏厅
And then off to violin land with all

381
00:27:40,609 --> 00:27:43,151
感受美妙而优雅的气氛
its sweetness, delicacy and harmony.

382
00:27:43,372 --> 00:27:47,895
没有红头发委托人 出难题困扰我们
And no red headed clients to vex us with their conundrums.

383
00:28:12,746 --> 00:28:14,767
他整个下午都坐在观众席
All the afternoon he sat in the stalls

384
00:28:15,530 --> 00:28:18,177
沉醉在欢乐的意境中
wrapped in the most perfect happiness

385
00:28:18,948 --> 00:28:23,982
他满脸的微笑 迷离的眼神
while his gently smiling face, and his languid dreamy eyes

386
00:28:24,400 --> 00:28:27,182
和做大侦探时的福尔摩斯
were as unlike those of Holmes the sleuth hound

387
00:28:27,841 --> 00:28:29,685
神态迥异 判若两人
as it was possible to conceive.

388
00:28:34,523 --> 00:28:37,670
看着他完全融入音乐当中
When I saw him so enwrapped in music

389
00:28:38,828 --> 00:28:42,069
我觉得一个邪恶的时刻可能即将来临
I felt that an evil time might be coming upon those

390
00:28:42,403 --> 00:28:45,196
而他会追查到底
he had set himself to hunt down.

391
00:29:36,441 --> 00:29:37,868
精彩绝伦 华生
Excellent Watson.

392
00:29:37,994 --> 00:29:39,598
你有做制图师的才华
You have a future as a cartographer.

393
00:29:40,246 --> 00:29:41,840
那是阿瑟尔尼・琼斯侦探
That will be Athelney Jones.

394
00:29:41,997 --> 00:29:43,351
我认为有苏格兰场的人
I thought it was well enough to have someone

395
00:29:43,414 --> 00:29:44,684
与我们同往比较好
from Scotland Yard with us.

396
00:29:44,770 --> 00:29:46,927
他在侦探这个行业 算是个低能儿
He's an absolute imbecile at his profession

397
00:29:47,063 --> 00:29:49,897
但抓人的时候顽强得像只大龙虾
but he does the tenacity of a lobster when he gets

398
00:29:50,002 --> 00:29:51,512
一遇到罪犯就紧抓不放
his claws into someone.

399
00:29:52,817 --> 00:29:53,983
晚上好 琼斯
Good evening Jones.

400
00:29:54,214 --> 00:29:55,862
我们又成为搭档了 福尔摩斯先生
So we're working in couples again,Mr. Holmes.

401
00:29:56,591 --> 00:29:58,967
我们这位朋友是个追猎高手
Our friend is a wonderful man for starting a chase.

402
00:29:59,208 --> 00:30:01,667
他所需的仅是一条 帮他捕获猎物的老狗
All he needs is an old dog to help him do the running down.

403
00:30:01,771 --> 00:30:04,136
梅里韦瑟先生 我的朋友和同事华生医生
Mr. Merryweather, my friend and college Dr. Watson.

404
00:30:04,545 --> 00:30:05,701
你好 先生
How do you do sir?

405
00:30:06,316 --> 00:30:08,202
我只希望我们的追捕
I only hope a wild goose may not prove

406
00:30:08,359 --> 00:30:09,452
不要徒劳无功
to be the end of our chase.

407
00:30:10,111 --> 00:30:11,371
就我个人而言 并不看好
I'm not personally in favor

408
00:30:11,632 --> 00:30:13,174
业余犯罪调查
of amateur criminal investigation.

409
00:30:13,467 --> 00:30:15,519
你应该对福尔摩斯先生充满信心
You might place considerable confidence in Mr. Holmes.

410
00:30:16,313 --> 00:30:17,959
既然您这么说 琼斯先生
Oh, if you say so Mr. Jones.

411
00:30:18,335 --> 00:30:20,575
他自有一套办法 要是他不介意...
He has his own little methods, which if he won't

412
00:30:20,723 --> 00:30:22,192
我这么说 有点过于理论化
mind me saying so a little theoretical

413
00:30:22,640 --> 00:30:24,546
和妙想天开 但他倒是具有...
and fantastic, but he has the makings

414
00:30:24,756 --> 00:30:25,766
...侦探的素质
of a detective in him.

415
00:30:26,456 --> 00:30:29,019
但我还是要说 正如我说过的
But I do say as I've said before

416
00:30:29,416 --> 00:30:31,010
科伯格分行非常安全
the Colburg Branch of the Bank is as well secured

417
00:30:31,199 --> 00:30:32,271
如伦敦任一座楼房一样
as any building in London.

418
00:30:32,929 --> 00:30:34,658
它是不可能被破门而入的
There isn't a possibility that it could be broken into.

419
00:30:34,847 --> 00:30:37,515
连保险公司顾问都这样说
Even insurance assessors agree on that point.

420
00:30:37,849 --> 00:30:39,046
而先生 你应该知道
And you sir should know

421
00:30:39,142 --> 00:30:41,194
作为银行经理和董事
being not only the resident manager but also the director.

422
00:30:42,227 --> 00:30:43,769
我应该知道 并且确实知道
I should know and I do know.

423
00:30:44,093 --> 00:30:45,499
还有 这可是我27年来
And what is more, this is the first time

424
00:30:45,656 --> 00:30:47,312
头一次错过
for seven and twenty years that I've missed my

425
00:30:47,491 --> 00:30:49,012
俱乐部的周六威士忌之夜
Saturday night of whiskey at my club.

426
00:30:49,243 --> 00:30:51,608
对我造成很大的不便啊
And I find myself extremely inconvenienced.

427
00:30:52,359 --> 00:30:54,672
我想你会发现 今晚的行动
I think that you will find the game tonight

428
00:30:55,216 --> 00:30:58,989
更加刺激 赌注将会是
much more exciting and the stake will be

429
00:30:59,156 --> 00:31:01,657
好几千英镑
for many, many thousands of pounds.

430
00:31:02,658 --> 00:31:04,763
我的奖赏是什么呢? 福尔摩斯先生
And what will be my reward be Mr. Homes?

431
00:31:06,005 --> 00:31:08,600
一位年轻人 名叫克莱
A young man, called Clay.

432
00:31:09,152 --> 00:31:10,662
约翰・克莱？
John Clay?

433
00:31:10,945 --> 00:31:13,081
噢 我真想抓住那个恶魔
Oh, how I'd like to get my hands on that devil.

434
00:31:13,666 --> 00:31:14,738
你会的
You shall.

435
00:31:14,792 --> 00:31:16,636
福尔摩斯先生所说这个年轻人是个绅士
This young fellow's a gentleman as Mr. Holmes says

436
00:31:16,866 --> 00:31:18,293
但背叛了自己的阶层
but he's turned against his class.

437
00:31:18,961 --> 00:31:20,211
如恶魔般狡诈
He's as cunning as the devil.

438
00:31:20,514 --> 00:31:22,639
如鳝鱼般圆滑 把杀人和诈骗
Slippery as an eel and he's turned crib cracking

439
00:31:22,756 --> 00:31:23,974
当作一门艺术
and forgery into a fine art.

440
00:31:24,580 --> 00:31:26,716
其祖父是王室公爵
His grandfather was a royal duke

441
00:31:27,665 --> 00:31:31,176
他本人曾在伊顿公学 和牛津大学念过书
and he himself was educated at Eaton and Oxford.

442
00:31:31,178 --> 00:31:34,398
所以 华生 带上枪
So Watson, bring the gun.

443
00:31:34,973 --> 00:31:37,484
走吧 先生们 马车就在楼下
Come gentlemen our cab is below.

444
00:33:20,704 --> 00:33:22,308
保险库的钥匙只有两把
There are only two keys to the vault.

445
00:33:25,290 --> 00:33:28,000
我有一把 行长有一把
I have one, the chairman holds the other

446
00:33:28,154 --> 00:33:29,386
放在他的私人保险柜里
in his personal safe.

447
00:33:38,633 --> 00:33:40,519
从上面攻进来相当困难
Well you are certainly not vulnerable from above.

448
00:33:40,936 --> 00:33:42,696
从下面来也是
Nor from below.

449
00:33:42,855 --> 00:33:43,688
稍等一下
Just a minute.

450
00:33:43,866 --> 00:33:46,461
请您小声一点
I'm going to ask you to be a little more quiet please.

451
00:34:09,874 --> 00:34:11,363
请您找个箱子坐下
Might I get you to sit on one of those boxes

452
00:34:11,604 --> 00:34:13,041
别乱动
and not to interfere?

453
00:34:33,588 --> 00:34:35,713
根本不可能有小偷
There is no way in which a thief

454
00:34:35,945 --> 00:34:37,299
能够强行闯入银行
could break into this bank.

455
00:34:50,851 --> 00:34:53,769
有什么特殊原因使得小偷
Is there a special reason why a thief

456
00:34:53,936 --> 00:34:55,425
想要强行闯入这个银行吗?
should want to break into this bank?

457
00:34:57,887 --> 00:34:59,543
没什么特别的...
Nothing particularly...

458
00:35:00,534 --> 00:35:02,013
过去几个月进来的东西呢?
Something in the past few months?

459
00:35:03,266 --> 00:35:05,516
你想对我们隐藏的事?
Something that you had concealed from us?

460
00:35:07,164 --> 00:35:08,820
这是机密信息
The information I have is confidential

461
00:35:09,030 --> 00:35:10,665
只有银行董事才知道
known only to the directors of the bank.

462
00:35:10,864 --> 00:35:13,073
不能把它泄露给公众
It is not to be divulged to members of the public,

463
00:35:14,461 --> 00:35:16,711
业余侦探也不行
not even amateur detectives.

464
00:35:17,870 --> 00:35:21,611
是私人顾问侦探 梅里韦瑟先生
Private consulting detective, Mr. Merryweather.

465
00:35:22,268 --> 00:35:24,310
在打击犯罪上独一无二
Unique in the annuls of crime I believe,

466
00:35:24,416 --> 00:35:25,812
难道不是吗 警官?
isn't that so inspector?

467
00:35:25,959 --> 00:35:27,000
是的 医生
Yes, doctor.

468
00:35:27,189 --> 00:35:28,929
我建议你与福尔摩斯先生合作
I advise you to cooperate with Mr. Holmes.

469
00:35:31,598 --> 00:35:34,703
尤其在这个时候 我正想法设法帮你
Especially as at this moment I am trying to save your skin

470
00:35:35,580 --> 00:35:37,080
和其他董事度过危机
and that of your fellow directors.

471
00:35:38,416 --> 00:35:40,291
那么到底是什么?
So what is it?

472
00:35:42,241 --> 00:35:43,522
我们的法国黄金
Our French gold.

473
00:35:44,597 --> 00:35:46,941
几个月前我们恰好有机会增加资金来源
We had occasion some months ago to strengthen our resources

474
00:35:47,172 --> 00:35:50,111
从法兰西银行
and borrowed for that purpose 60,000 Napoleons

475
00:35:50,206 --> 00:35:51,216
借了6万拿破仑金币(一块拿破仑金币值20法郎)
from the bank of France.

476
00:35:51,372 --> 00:35:55,822
所以我们的黄金储备就比
Therefore our reserve of bullion is much larger than is usual

477
00:35:55,980 --> 00:35:58,387
其他分行多很多
in such a branch of the bank.

478
00:36:00,598 --> 00:36:02,421
这些金币在哪?
Where is this gold?

479
00:36:04,715 --> 00:36:07,956
华生医生坐的那些大箱子里
The crates upon which Dr. Watson sits

480
00:36:08,937 --> 00:36:11,187
装着3万拿破仑金币
contain 30,000 Napoleons

481
00:36:11,762 --> 00:36:13,522
用铅箔一层一层包着
wrapped between layers of lead foil.

482
00:36:18,152 --> 00:36:20,111
我们可以看看吗?
May we see it?

483
00:38:22,303 --> 00:38:26,628
这比我当初所想
This is much bolder and larger in conception

484
00:38:26,733 --> 00:38:29,599
更大胆 更大规模 难道不是吗 琼斯?
than I had first thought, wouldn't you say Jones?

485
00:38:29,922 --> 00:38:31,161
确实是的
I would indeed.

486
00:38:31,225 --> 00:38:33,038
这位克莱更像个业余探险家
This Clay's more of an amateur adventurer

487
00:38:33,248 --> 00:38:34,602
或是冲动型罪犯
or spur of the moment criminal,

488
00:38:34,748 --> 00:38:37,666
长期计划不是克莱的风格 一点都不是
Long planning is not Clay's type at all sir, not at all.

489
00:38:37,876 --> 00:38:42,733
除非他是别人手中的棋子
Unless he's a pawn in a much larger game.

490
00:38:45,350 --> 00:38:47,100
梅里韦瑟先生 有人探知...
Mr. Merryweather someone has had access to

491
00:38:47,226 --> 00:38:49,602
你最机密的信息
information of the most confidential sort.

492
00:38:51,167 --> 00:38:52,969
制定了周密详尽的计划
Careful plans have been made.

493
00:38:56,024 --> 00:38:58,483
这是经人精心筹划的
A mastermind has been at work.

494
00:39:01,393 --> 00:39:02,935
你是说...
Are you suggesting that...

495
00:39:04,436 --> 00:39:06,593
我是说这非常像
I am suggesting that it bears the hallmarks

496
00:39:06,719 --> 00:39:08,396
莫里亚蒂教授的手段
of Professor Moriarity's work.

497
00:39:11,775 --> 00:39:13,348
莫里亚蒂?
Moriarity?

498
00:39:16,267 --> 00:39:17,923
莫里亚蒂是谁?
And who is this Moriarity?

499
00:39:18,238 --> 00:39:19,759
我们并不清楚 先生
We don't really know sir.

500
00:39:19,853 --> 00:39:21,561
我和警方都不曾想到
That is neither the police nor I think

501
00:39:21,698 --> 00:39:23,594
夏洛克・福尔摩斯先生已经在盯着他
Mr. Sherlock Holmes here has ever set eyes on him.

502
00:39:24,169 --> 00:39:26,659
他的名字在黑社会人所皆知
His name echoes and re-echoes throughout the underworld.

503
00:39:27,119 --> 00:39:29,463
显然他出身高贵
It appears that he's a man of good birth,

504
00:39:30,142 --> 00:39:37,782
受过极好的教育 但是他继承了...
an excellent education but he has hereditary

505
00:39:38,429 --> 00:39:40,971
恶魔般的特质
tendencies of the most diabolical kind.

506
00:39:42,807 --> 00:39:45,068
血液里充斥着犯罪的因子
A criminal strain runs in his blood

507
00:39:46,247 --> 00:39:49,290
日趋严重 变得相当危险
which has increased and rendered infinitely more dangerous

508
00:39:49,562 --> 00:39:51,468
因为他的智力 非比寻常
by his extraordinary mental powers.

509
00:39:52,731 --> 00:39:57,890
他组织了这座城市中
He's the organizer of half that is evil and nearly all that

510
00:39:58,068 --> 00:40:00,923
半数罪案和几乎所有未被识破的案件
is undetected in this great city.

511
00:40:03,301 --> 00:40:05,593
却一直逍遥法外
He is never caught.

512
00:40:06,344 --> 00:40:09,137
他有手下被抓 但作为中坚力量的他...
His agent is caught but the central power

513
00:40:10,275 --> 00:40:14,267
一直逍遥法外 甚至没有被怀疑过
is never caught certainly even suspected.

514
00:40:18,332 --> 00:40:20,009
教授今晚是不会出现了
We shall not see the professor tonight.

515
00:40:28,043 --> 00:40:30,371
今晚的敌人的唯一退路是...
The only way for tonight's enemy to escape is through

516
00:40:30,476 --> 00:40:31,799
经由当铺逃窜
the pawn brokers.

517
00:40:31,873 --> 00:40:33,592
已经有一个警官守在门口了
There's already an inspector at the doors.

518
00:40:37,471 --> 00:40:39,158
没错
Exactly.

519
00:40:40,066 --> 00:40:43,547
时间差不多到了... 各就各位...
We have only a few moments... positions...

520
00:40:49,281 --> 00:40:52,491
能麻烦你把灯关掉吗?
Would you be so kind as to put out this lamp.

521
00:40:52,940 --> 00:40:54,367
然后坐在黑暗中?
And sit in the dark?

522
00:40:55,900 --> 00:40:57,348
恐怕是的
I'm afraid so.

523
00:40:57,453 --> 00:40:58,817
我们不能冒险发出亮光
We cannot risk the presence of light.

524
00:41:09,024 --> 00:41:12,004
一旦我亮出灯光 动作迅速...
When I shine the light, act swiftly...

525
00:41:12,839 --> 00:41:14,266
要是他们肆无忌惮的开枪
If they fire have no compassion

526
00:41:14,497 --> 00:41:15,715
马上击毙他们
about shooting them down.

527
00:43:23,254 --> 00:43:24,409
噢 天哪!
Great god.

528
00:43:24,411 --> 00:43:25,296
快逃 快
Jump at it, jump.

529
00:43:39,245 --> 00:43:41,058
没用的 约翰・克莱
It's no good jump John Clay.

530
00:43:42,111 --> 00:43:43,392
你逃不掉了
You have no chance at all.

531
00:43:51,858 --> 00:43:53,702
明白了...
So I see...

532
00:43:55,110 --> 00:43:57,454
但我的同伴会没事
though I fancy my pal's all right.

533
00:43:58,310 --> 00:43:59,883
现在他正跑向...
At this moment he is running into

534
00:44:00,041 --> 00:44:01,499
警察的环抱中
the welcoming arms of the police.

535
00:44:03,731 --> 00:44:05,794
你做得还真是天衣无缝
You seem to have done the thing very completely.

536
00:44:05,983 --> 00:44:07,222
我该称赞你才对
I must compliment you.

537
00:44:07,317 --> 00:44:08,608
你也一样
And I you.

538
00:44:08,765 --> 00:44:11,161
我是夏洛克・福尔摩斯 私人侦探
I'm Sherlock Holmes, a private investigator.

539
00:44:12,508 --> 00:44:14,216
我从没怀疑过你是...
I didn't for a moment suspect your being

540
00:44:14,540 --> 00:44:16,311
警察 福尔摩斯先生
a policeman Mr. Holmes.

541
00:44:17,126 --> 00:44:19,304
得了吧 回去再聊
Come on, hold that one off for the Darby's.

542
00:44:19,366 --> 00:44:20,970
别用你那脏手碰我
I beg you to take your filthy hands off me.

543
00:44:22,223 --> 00:44:24,411
你们不知道我的血管里流着皇家血统吗
You may not be aware that I have royal blood

544
00:44:24,517 --> 00:44:28,248
请你们跟我说话的时候
in my veins and be so kind as to say "sir" and "please"

545
00:44:28,384 --> 00:44:29,675
都要用"先生"和"请"
when you address me.

546
00:44:29,791 --> 00:44:30,801
那好
All right.

547
00:44:30,854 --> 00:44:32,927
请先生上台阶吧
Would you please sir, mind marching upstairs

548
00:44:32,991 --> 00:44:35,252
我们会用马车将阁下
while we get a cab to transport your highness

549
00:44:35,441 --> 00:44:36,701
送到警署
to the police station?

550
00:44:37,744 --> 00:44:39,098
这还差不多
That's better.

551
00:44:46,063 --> 00:44:47,563
先生们
Gentlemen.

552
00:44:51,859 --> 00:44:55,037
噢 有个问题 克莱先生
Oh, one question Mr. Clay.

553
00:44:56,143 --> 00:44:58,519
莫里亚蒂教授是否...
Am I right in thinking that professor Moriarity

554
00:44:58,593 --> 00:45:00,989
策划了红发会事件?
was somewhere behind the idea of the Red Headed League?

555
00:45:05,503 --> 00:45:07,774
我建议你再也不要提起 这个名字 福尔摩斯先生
I suggest you keep that name off your lips Mr. Holmes

556
00:45:08,996 --> 00:45:10,621
要是你还想将来活得好好的话
if you value your future well-being.

557
00:45:16,417 --> 00:45:18,720
真的 先生们 我都不知道说什么好了
Really gentlemen, I don't know what to say.

558
00:45:18,815 --> 00:45:20,221
请原谅我 福尔摩斯先生 我竟怀疑过
Please forgive me Mr. Holmes for ever doubting

559
00:45:20,379 --> 00:45:23,026
你的神机妙算 经天纬地之才
your outstanding, your brilliant qualities.

560
00:45:23,131 --> 00:45:24,777
毫无疑问 你用最完美的方式
There is no doubt you've detected and defeated

561
00:45:24,830 --> 00:45:27,425
侦查并破获了这起严谨周密的案件
in the most complete manner one of the boldest attempts

562
00:45:27,550 --> 00:45:30,280
银行盗窃案 真是闻所未闻
at bank robbery that has ever come within my experience.

563
00:45:30,450 --> 00:45:32,877
梅里韦瑟先生 这件事情上我有点破费
Mr. Merryweather I have then some small expense over this matter

564
00:45:33,023 --> 00:45:35,826
希望银行能给予补偿
I shall expect the bank to refund.

565
00:45:37,808 --> 00:45:39,714
当然 当然
Of course, of course.

566
00:46:36,432 --> 00:46:38,891
你不会是早知道...
It won't do you know...

567
00:46:40,238 --> 00:46:42,374
这样行不通吧
it won't do.

568
00:46:42,864 --> 00:46:44,395
不 教授
No Professor.

569
00:46:45,700 --> 00:46:46,804
抱歉 我们令您失望了
I'm sorry we failed you.

570
00:46:50,109 --> 00:46:51,286
夏洛克・福尔摩斯...
Sherlock Holmes...

571
00:46:51,464 --> 00:46:55,258
福尔摩斯在侦探这行只是个外行
Holmes is a mere amateur in the field of detection.

572
00:46:57,968 --> 00:47:04,117
但他看起来是个聪明人 或是运气不错
Still he seems a clever man or a lucky one

573
00:47:06,339 --> 00:47:10,101
还有碍我事的本领
and he has a positive talent for getting in my way.

574
00:47:12,114 --> 00:47:13,301
要除掉他吗?
Should he be removed?

575
00:47:14,615 --> 00:47:16,407
可能有这个必要
It may be necessary.

576
00:47:17,785 --> 00:47:19,493
但会令人失望
It would be disappointing.

577
00:47:20,891 --> 00:47:22,870
我觉得他很有意思
I find him interesting.

578
00:47:23,914 --> 00:47:26,363
我相信这是他第三次
I believe this is the third time

579
00:47:26,582 --> 00:47:28,061
给我添麻烦了
he has incommoded me.

580
00:47:30,044 --> 00:47:31,784
如果再继续下去 那么当然要...
If this continues then certainly something

581
00:47:31,919 --> 00:47:33,919
做点什么来刺激一下福尔摩斯先生
will have to be done to encourage Mr. Holmes

582
00:47:34,359 --> 00:47:39,351
让他要么离开 要么靠边站
either to withdraw or stand clear.

583
00:47:51,778 --> 00:47:54,174
谢谢
Thank you.

584
00:48:14,287 --> 00:48:16,110
早上好 治安官
Morning Constable.

585
00:48:21,048 --> 00:48:22,965
请原谅 华生医生
Beg your pardon Dr. Watson

586
00:48:23,946 --> 00:48:25,477
但这一切太让人难以承受了
but this has all been too much for me.

587
00:48:25,739 --> 00:48:28,813
顾客都敬重我 因我值得信赖
My clients respect me as a man of confidence

588
00:48:28,991 --> 00:48:30,887
但我现在还有什么自信!
but where's the confidence left here.

589
00:48:31,128 --> 00:48:32,148
我全毁了...
I'm utterly ruined...

590
00:48:32,567 --> 00:48:34,463
噢 开心点 威尔逊先生
Oh, cheer up Mr. Wilson.

591
00:48:34,651 --> 00:48:36,474
等清理完残局后 会感觉好点的
You'll feel better when you've cleared up the mess.

592
00:48:36,757 --> 00:48:38,027
你说的是很对...
Well that's all very well...

593
00:48:38,206 --> 00:48:40,269
福尔摩斯先生 让我把这个给您
And Mr. Holmes asked me to give you this,

594
00:48:41,792 --> 00:48:44,918
50块金币 (价值75英镑)
50 sovereigns with the compliments

595
00:48:45,294 --> 00:48:46,669
城市和郊区银行敬赠
of the City and Suburban Bank.

596
00:48:46,764 --> 00:48:48,618
嗯 太好了
Well that's fair enough.

597
00:48:48,766 --> 00:48:52,111
噢 华生医生 这比我的期望好太多了
Oh, Dr. Watson, this is more than acceptable,

598
00:48:52,299 --> 00:48:55,373
请代我问候夏洛克・福尔摩斯先生
and my compliments to Mr. Sherlock Holmes.

599
00:48:55,875 --> 00:48:57,927
他也向你致意 威尔逊先生
And he sends the same to you Mr. Wilson

600
00:48:58,074 --> 00:48:59,282
一点忠告...
and a word of advice...

601
00:48:59,867 --> 00:49:01,450
下次你雇用伙计时
Next time you engage an assistant

602
00:49:01,619 --> 00:49:03,661
付他适当的薪水
pay him the proper wage.

603
00:49:04,516 --> 00:49:05,766
再见
Good day to you.

604
00:49:24,135 --> 00:49:29,221
噢 福尔摩斯 我确信自己
Oh, Holmes, I trust I am not more dense

605
00:49:29,295 --> 00:49:31,420
并不比别人笨拙 可我看到...
than my neighbors and yet here I have seen

606
00:49:31,514 --> 00:49:33,577
你所看到的 听到你所听到的
what you have seen, heard what you have heard

607
00:49:33,652 --> 00:49:35,777
然而你不仅对已经发生的事情了如指掌
and yet you have seen clearly not only what had happened,

608
00:49:36,174 --> 00:49:38,894
而且还知道将要发生什么 可我仍然觉得自己
but what was about to happen while to me the whole business

609
00:49:39,072 --> 00:49:41,229
一头雾水 不知道发生什么事
was still confused and grotesque.

610
00:49:41,324 --> 00:49:42,730
华生医生 回想一下
Dr. Watson recollect,

611
00:49:43,648 --> 00:49:47,316
当我听到那个伙计只要求一半薪水时
when I heard that the assistant had come for half wages,

612
00:49:48,704 --> 00:49:50,631
很明显他带着某种目的
it was obvious that he had some motive

613
00:49:51,008 --> 00:49:52,299
为确保事情在他掌控之中
for securing the situation.

614
00:49:52,842 --> 00:49:54,884
可你如何猜透他的动机?
Yes, but how did you know what his motive was?

615
00:49:55,344 --> 00:49:56,802
倘若那个当铺有女人
Had there been a woman in the house I would have

616
00:49:56,929 --> 00:49:59,169
我会怀疑不过是些庸俗的风流事
suspected immediately if some vulgar intrigue,

617
00:49:59,294 --> 00:50:01,440
但当我听到威尔逊先生说起
but when I heard from Mr. Wilson

618
00:50:01,963 --> 00:50:04,057
硫酸烧伤的疤和打过耳洞的耳朵
about the acid stain and the pierced ears

619
00:50:04,569 --> 00:50:07,445
我就知道文森特・斯波尔丁和约翰・克莱
I knew that Vincent Spalding and John Clay

620
00:50:07,551 --> 00:50:08,540
是同一个人
were the same person.

621
00:50:08,604 --> 00:50:10,031
克莱为什么在那里呢？
But why was Clay there?

622
00:50:11,793 --> 00:50:13,335
照相就是线索所在
The photography gave you the clue.

623
00:50:13,638 --> 00:50:14,877
是的
Exactly.

624
00:50:14,962 --> 00:50:17,619
地下室 他在地下室做着某种勾当
The cellar, he was working on something in the cellar.

625
00:50:18,058 --> 00:50:20,423
每天都干好几个小时
Something which took many hours a day

626
00:50:20,977 --> 00:50:24,760
整整两个月 肯定是在挖地道 但通向哪里呢？
for two months on end. He was tunneling but where to?

627
00:50:26,751 --> 00:50:28,970
那天我用手杖敲打人行道时
When I tapped my stick on the pavement

628
00:50:29,253 --> 00:50:31,545
不过想弄清楚
in the street that day I was ascertaining

629
00:50:31,641 --> 00:50:35,017
结果那条地道是从前面通向房子后面
whether the tunnel stretched in front or behind the building.

630
00:50:35,351 --> 00:50:38,529
它在前边 是朝后延伸的
It was in front, towards the back.

631
00:50:39,291 --> 00:50:41,145
从这儿到河滨大街怎么走?
Could you tell me the way to the strand from here?

632
00:50:43,076 --> 00:50:45,274
我立即便认出是克莱 并拖延了他的时间
I recognized Clay immediately and delayed him

633
00:50:45,598 --> 00:50:48,370
仔细观察了他的膝盖
to have time to examine his knees.

634
00:50:49,715 --> 00:50:52,257
显然他花了很多时间挖隧道
There he spoke clearly of many hours or tunneling.

635
00:50:52,572 --> 00:50:55,041
毫无疑问连通了错综复杂的下水道
No doubt linking up with a maze of sewers

636
00:50:55,136 --> 00:50:56,459
就在萨克斯科伯格广场下面
beneath Saxe Coburg Square.

637
00:50:57,106 --> 00:50:58,981
他们关闭红发会办公室时
When they closed the Red Headed League offices,

638
00:50:59,118 --> 00:51:00,868
就标志着他们不再在意
it was a sign they no longer cared about

639
00:51:00,911 --> 00:51:02,661
杰贝斯・威尔逊是否在当铺里
Jay Beards Wilson's presence.

640
00:51:02,746 --> 00:51:04,965
换句话说 地道已经挖通了
In other words the tunnel was complete.

641
00:51:05,029 --> 00:51:07,467
他们会在星期六采取行动
And that they would make the attempt on a Saturday

642
00:51:07,540 --> 00:51:08,800
只是猜测？
was just a guess?

643
00:51:09,991 --> 00:51:12,732
华生 你令我失望了
Watson, you disappoint me.

644
00:51:13,941 --> 00:51:15,451
我从不猜测
I never guess.

645
00:51:16,600 --> 00:51:19,445
星期六晚上偷盗金块 是再好不过的
Saturday's an excellent night for stealing bullion.

646
00:51:19,904 --> 00:51:21,487
这样便有一整天时间逃跑
It gives you a full day to escape.

647
00:51:22,103 --> 00:51:23,540
请拿好 慢走
Thank you then.

648
00:51:25,720 --> 00:51:27,314
有劳
Thank you.

649
00:51:27,858 --> 00:51:30,140
你的讲解真是精彩绝伦 福尔摩斯
Oh, you've reasoned it out beautifully Holmes.

650
00:51:30,181 --> 00:51:33,370
就像一根长长的链条 每一个环节都天衣无缝
It's so long a chain and yet every link rings true.

651
00:51:33,455 --> 00:51:34,861
这样我才不会无聊
It saved me from irony.

652
00:51:35,101 --> 00:51:38,332
有时我觉得我这一生
You know sometimes I think my whole life is spent

653
00:51:38,438 --> 00:51:41,512
都在苦苦挣扎以摆脱
in one long effort to escape from

654
00:51:41,585 --> 00:51:43,116
庸碌平凡
the common places of existence.

655
00:51:43,222 --> 00:51:44,044
不 不
No, no.

656
00:51:44,129 --> 00:51:47,099
您是个福泽人间的精英 福尔摩斯
You are a benefactor of the race Holmes.

657
00:51:48,935 --> 00:51:50,821
哦 也许小有用处吧
Well maybe it is of some little use after all.

658
00:51:53,542 --> 00:51:57,025
人是渺小的 著作就是一切
"L'homme c'est rien...l'oeuvre c'est tout"

659
00:51:57,180 --> 00:51:59,988
正如居斯塔夫・福楼拜写信给乔治・桑时所言
as Gusta Flabare wrote to George Sand.

660
00:52:00,947 --> 00:52:02,703
