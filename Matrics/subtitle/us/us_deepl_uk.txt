 Are you looking forward to our honeymoon?  
 I'm looking forward to it.  
 Yes, if you're going to work, do it while there's no one around.  
 - We're here to say goodbye.   
 - Yes, have a great honeymoon!  
 - Thank you.   
 - I'd better go and pack the luggage.  
 No, I've already packed.   
 I just can't find your swim trunks.  
 Your swim trunks? I don't have any swim trunks.  
 I'm going to go pack my unimpressive extra-long swim trunks.  
 Good, you're still here.   
 I'm here to wish you a wonderful honeymoon.  
 Thank you, thank you.  
 I also want you to know that I'm going to tell the kids' dad today.  
 What's up?  
 - We know the boy's father is Rose.   
 - How did you know?  
 It's his sweater. 
 But oh my God!  
 I was so hoping that Rosie would be the first to know.   
 But you did, and I'm so relieved.  
 This is wonderful. I'm your child's aunt.  
 I know.  
 I'm an aunt.  
 I'm an uncle. 
 Come on.  
 - You will all be your child's aunt, uncle and aunt.   
- Yes, but only I am related to the child.  
 Now that you know, you can help me with advice on what I should say to Rosie.  
 What do you want to say?  
 I want to tell him that I want to keep the child.  
 He can do whatever he wants.  
 That sounds very good.  
 Yeah, it's just, how do I start?  
 I mean, what should my opening line be?  
 - Okay, that was great. Thanks.   
- Good luck. - Yeah, see you later.  
 What's that all about?  
 I guess it doesn't matter if I tell you now.   
 Rachel's pregnant with Rosie's baby.  
 What? I don't know at all.  
 Why didn't you tell me?  
 Why would I say something like that?  
 - I don't think you can keep a secret.   
 I am a master of confidentiality 
  I have kept all our secrets.  
 - What secrets?  
 - No, Joey.  
 I'm not going to tell you because I'm a top secret.  
 - You're going to tell me later?  
 - You already know that.  
 It's so romantic to send someone on a honeymoon.  
 Monica and Chandler are getting married.  
 Rosie and Rachel are going to have a baby.  
 - Maybe you and I should find something to do.  
 - You're right, my love.  
 Damn it, I left the guitar at their house. 
  Will you open the door for me later?  
 No, I don't have my keys. They took my keys and said to give them to you.  
 - What?
 They took mine and said they wanted to give it to you.  
 - Why did they take our keys?  
 Maybe they don't trust us  
 They asked me to keep their keys the last time they went out of town.  
 That time you broke the ketchup bottle and cleaned it with the towels that Monica gave to the guests?  
 - Hey, I washed the towels.  
 - No, that doesn't sound like me.  
 - I need my guitar.   
 - I've got stuff at his house too.  
 - What's that?  
 - Monica's cheese chicken. I've got to get rid of it.  
 Mr. Trigger?  
 I have to go to Monica's and Chandler's.  
 It's an emergency. 
 There's a gas leak. 
 Bring the garlic bread.  
 - Did Rachel find you?  
 - No, what's wrong?  
 She's looking for you.  
 Then I'll see her again later.  
 - She really needs to talk to you right away.  
 - Yes, it seems to be important.  
 No, what?  
 I think I know what she's up to.  
 Really?  
 Yes, we promised not to tell anyone, but... . .   Rachel slept with me about a month ago.  
 And what happened?  
 I thought you'd be surprised.  
 I'm sorry. . ... What about the result?  
 We said we'd only do it once . . ...  
 I think she might want to get back together with me  
 I don't think that's the case  
 - Why? What could it be, of course?  
 - I don't feel comfortable  
 I believe that's what happened  
 No wonder she looked at me strangely at the wedding.  
 She didn't tell you anything?  
 - Maybe you had the wrong food.  
 - Bertol, go and talk to Rachel.  
 - All right, then.  
 Do you know what I've learned?  
 Maybe I'm the kind of man who makes women forget all night long.  
 They'll never be satisfied with me.  
 I should have remembered that  
 The next one  
 - They're kissing, let's get on with it.  
 - Never mind them, they love each other and I love you, but in an orderly way.  
 Next  
 Hey, can you kiss while you walk? 
 I'm sorry we didn't hear you. 
  We're going on our honeymoon.  
 Let me take a look  
 There's still room in first class  
 She upgraded them to first class because they were going on their honeymoon.  
 - We pretended we were going on a honeymoon too  
 - We're really going on a honeymoon. 
  Touch my ass!  
 - Next in line.  
 - I'm sorry, I almost didn't hear you.  
 I love my new husband so much  
 We're going on a honeymoon  
 - Congratulations.  
 - Thank you. - Okay, Mr Po, you're on 25J. - Mrs Po is on 25K.  
 We're going on our honeymoon. Can you upgrade us to first class?  
 I'm sorry, first class is full. The couple just took the last two seats.  
 See? If you listen to me and plug them in, she'll give us first class seats, damn it!  
 Will J and K not be joined at the same time?  
 I still can't believe they took my keys. You gave me your keys for safekeeping.  
 Then, of course, I will give it back to you. . ...  
 ...as soon as the person who cleans the key has wiped it clean.  
 - What's that sound?  
 Trigger, what are you doing?  
 - You said there was a gas leak.  
 - Why don't you use the key to open the door?  
 By the time I find the keys to their house, the apartment will probably have blown up.  
 If there is another explosion in the apartment I manage, people will start asking questions.  
 How can we do this? 
 You see them walking into the first class lounge?  
 - Do you know what's in there?   - No. I don't know.  
 I don't know either. We have to go in.  
 - Pretend you're a first class passenger.  
 - Oh, my God, there are oranges.  
 - It's good to see you again.  
 - Would you mind showing me your ticket, sir?  
 No problem.  
 I can't see your seat number.  
 It doesn't matter. I've got it on my back. It's 1A.  
 - It's not a first class ticket. I'm sorry.  
 - It's okay, I'm sorry.  
 I'm sorry. I'm afraid I'm going to have to ask you to leave.  
 All right, run!   
 I think we really need to have a good talk.  
 That's right. Let's go in.  
 - Listen, I know why you're here. 
  - Really?  
 Yeah, to make you look good. ... ...   I think perhaps I should speak first.  
 Rosie and Rachel  
 Rachel and Rosie.  
 That's like a seesaw, isn't it? 
 What?  
 I mean, we had a good time that night, and we had a good time.  
 But don't you think we'd be better off as friends?  
 You mean... . . what? What?  
 Okay, here's the deal.  
 We can do it again if you want.  
 I don't have a problem with that.  
 In fact, I'm free now... ... Do you know?   
 Do you know? Can I talk now?  
 - Of course I can   
 I'm pregnant  
 Roth  
 Rosie.  
 All right, I'll wait until you're ready.  
 By the way, you're the baby's father.  
 - Do you want some water? 
 - I'm fine.  
 Rosie, don't feel any pressure, okay? 
  You can do whatever you want.  
 Yeah, I... I... I...  
 I just don't know... . .  
 I don't understand . ... .   How could this happen?  
 - We have insurance covers  
 - I know.  
 But the condom only works 97% of the time.  
 What?   They should be marked on the package  
 - It's marked on the package.  
 - No, they don't.  
 They should be marked on the package in big, bold letters  
 - Ross, leave the condoms alone!  
 - If I'd known, I wouldn't have bothered.  
 Listen, you know what?   I was terrified when I found out I was pregnant.
  - Scared? No, I wasn't.  
 I'm an angry consumer.  
 - Did you know that?
 We'll talk about it later.   
- No, I want to talk now.  
 In fact, I'd like to talk to the chairman of the insurance suite.  
 Maybe I should come back later. ... ... All right.  
 All right, I'll press one.  
 - I've looked everywhere and there's no gas leak.  
 - Can I heat this one up?  
 Anyway, I'll get them a new door.  
 Can you not mention this to Chandler and Monica?  
 Because they don't have any children of their own. ... ...this door is like his...  This door is like their child.  
 I have to put a new lock on it.  
 They're bound to find out.  
 It looks like a whole day's work.  
 I've got to cancel my yoga class.  
 Tell Molly I can't make it to yoga class today.  
 No problem.  
 - Oh, my God, what's wrong with the door?  
 - It's obvious, isn't it?  
 - Is Rachel here? 
 - Didn't you two talk about it?  
 Yes, but... But... Yeah, but... 
 Listen, you know that Rachel slept with me . . ...  But there's more to it than that.  
 Rachel's pregnant.  
 - My goodness!   
 - I don't believe it  
 - She is pregnant with my child   
 - This is the first time I've heard of it.  
 - You already know this, don't you? 
 - A little.  
 - Are you all right?  
 - I'll be fine.  
   I didn't take care of it.  
 - What did you say to her? 
  - I didn't say anything, but I spoke to the customer service department of the insurance company.  
 - I turned around and realised she had gone  
  But I just found out that the condom only has a 97% contraceptive effect.  
 - What?   - I have to go and find her.  
 Wait a minute. 
 Are you serious?  
 So there's a 3% chance that they won't work?  
 They should be marked on the packaging.  
 - Did they really do that?  
 - What?  
 - I can't believe we're here! 
  - What's the joke? 
 To celebrate your wedding, the restaurant is going to upgrade you to a honeymoon suite.  
 No, you've been spoiling us all day.  
 - Who are you?   - We are you.
 It's only 10 seconds too late.  
 You've already taken the first class seats, the lounge.
 We deserve free hospitality too!  
 It's not just you on your honeymoon  
 We can give you our honeymoon suite  
 It doesn't matter where we sleep  
 We come here to remember our love for each other  
 We don't need free hospitality We just want to be together  
 We need free hospitality  
 Monica, it's Joey. 
  Phoebe and I smell gas in your house.  
 - Is that true?
 Joey smells gas.  
 - What else is new?  
 - We'd like to take a look, but you've got our keys.   
- Do something to get in.  
 - I could break down your front door.  
 - Yes, that's it.  
 - You won't blame us for breaking anything?  
 - No, we won't.  
 - Are you banging on the door?
 I didn't hear a sound.  
 - All right, I'll bang on the door.  
  He's banging on the door. He's going to break it down.  
 All right, we're in.  
 - Rachel, are you still comfortable?  
 - If I'm comfortable, will you judge me?  
 The doctor will be right over to give you an ultrasound.     
 God, I swear, if they sell this in a pottery shop... ... ...we'll have to talk.  
 We need to talk.  
 Now? 
  I'm in a bit of a bad mood.  
 Bato, I really... I really... I really... I would like to 
 I'd like to apologise to you for the way I've just behaved.  
 - It's okay. I'm sorry you had to stay at the bedside.  
 - What? I'm sorry. I'm crazy.
 All I can think about is myself. I should have thought of you. ... ...  
 - It doesn't matter. Stay here at the head of the bed, Rose.  
 I want you to know that I'll be with you all the time, okay?  
 Come for a maternity check-up, take a Lamaze breathing lesson, decorate the apartment for Bao Bao.  
 But we can wait until after the wedding to worry about that.  
 - After the wedding? 
  - Yes, I think we should get married.  
 Is that your solution?  
 No, that's the right thing to do.  
 Maybe, as long as we love each other. 
 Rose, we're not in love, are we?  
 Yes, but you can't do this alone.  
 What do you mean?  
 - You can't even eat alone in a restaurant.  
 - What?  
 If you can't eat alone, how can you take the children alone?  
 - I can eat alone. 
 - When have you ever done that?  
 When some of the people at the table have finished eating and I haven't finished yet  
 Some people take two hours just to have a bowl of soup  
 You're a gobbler, Bato.  
 I grew up with Monica.  
 If you don't eat faster, you won't be able to eat.  
 Am I disturbing you?  
 No, Dr. Lange, please come in. 
 He's Rossi, the boy's father.  
 But I'm not her husband, because obviously she can bring up the children alone.  
 It's good to see you.
 I'm going to start the examination.  
 - Why can't you admit that you need me?  
 - I need you to stand here at the head of the bed.  
 All right, that looks normal.
 Here's what it looks like on the screen. This is your womb. ... This is your womb...  
 There's your baby.  
 Oh, my God.  
 There it is. I see it.  
 Congratulations!  
 I'll leave you alone for a moment.   
 - Thank you, thank you.  
 Isn't it amazing?  
 I can't see it.  
 - What?  
 - I can't see it  
 But you said you could see it.  
 I know. I lied. 
 I don't want her to think I'm a bad mother.  
 I can't even see my own baby.  
 Come here. 
 You can see it. 
 Come on. 
 It's right here.  
 It's so beautiful  
 I can see it.  
 - Do you really? 
 - No, I don't see it.  
 All right. Come on.  
 Do you see that little thing that looks like a peanut?  
 Sweetheart, that's the one.  
 Is that the one?  
 I can see it.  
 - Thank you.   
 - Don't be polite.  
 I don't believe that's our child.  
 Yes, that's our child.  
 - What did the doctor say?  
 - Everything is going well  
 - It's fine.  
 - Let them see the pictures of your womb.  
 I can't see my baby.   
  At first, I couldn't see it either. 
 But it's right there... . ...  
 Rose, I can't see it again.  
 I saw a man in your freezer.  
 Don't tell anyone.  
 You're playing cards with me as a bet?   
 Get out of here. 
 There will be no more kissing, no more weddings.  
 Have you ever tried to let your hair down?  
 Yes, I have.  
 It's beautiful.  
 Thank you, thank you.  
 Do you feel ashamed to go out with me?  
 Gabby would have been furious if she'd found out.  
 Oh my God, you're still in love with her.  
 In a few months' time I shall be Mrs. Victoire Largo.  
 I didn't realise I was so capable . . ...  
 Thank you, thank you.  
 - Did you tell Bree you were engaged?  
 - Yes.  
 She's hiking in Switzerland, but she sent me a basket of muffins.  
 - Joke's on you. 
 - No.  
 It's been 5,000 miles and it's still fresh.  
 I don't know how she did it.  
 Hey, it's time.  
 Let's get some champagne.  
 Wait a minute. Wait a minute.  
 You're not going to embarrass me with a heartfelt toast, are you?  
 I won't, but Susan wrote a poem.  
 A poem?  
 She changed the words of the song into her poem  
 Trying out   
 One, two, three tries  
 What are you waiting for?
 Go and open a bottle of champagne!  
 Yes, please.  
 Thank you, thank you.  
 Hey G a b y  
 Hey Edie!   
 I finally got to meet Victoire.  
 He's a real charmer.  
 He's good, isn't he?  
 I know things are moving a bit fast, but he's so good.  
 So you really love him?  
 Yes, I've never been so happy.  
 I'm so excited for you.  
 Edie, are you okay?  
 Yes, I'm--I'm fine. 
 Oh, my love.  
 Don't worry, you'll find the right person soon.  
 What do I know?  
 In fact, I've already found it.  
 I... I... . ... I'm simply crazy about him.  
 Who is it?  
 Oh, no, no, no.  
 Tonight is for you  
 Oh, no, no, no, Edie. 
 Say it.  
 I'd be happy to know who makes you so happy.  
 - Really?  
 - Of course!  
 I want to know who makes you grin like that.  
 Well, actually, it's Claus.  
 Who is it?
 Carol.  
 I'm dating Carol.  
 That's how Gabrielle Solis got hurt on the night of the engagement party.  
 Although she just laughed it off
 The truth is that Gabrielle was hurt much more deeply than anyone could see.  
 Gerald must have had another drinking problem last week. . ...    
 The postman had been at Sarah's for over an hour.
 It was like he delivered more than just parcels.  
 I could smell the whisky on Amy's breath.  
 It wasn't even noon yet.  
 John said she was taking a break to go to a religious retreat, but when did she start praying and get bigger breasts?  
 What kind of woman hides her husband's body in a freezer? 
 For 10 years?  That's crazy.  
 Did anyone talk to her?  
 I went and knocked on the door twice.  
 She ignored me.  
 Oh, I saw her curtains move. 
 I thought I saw her hand.  
 Oh, that's right. Now we know she's watching us.  
 Why should we feel embarrassed?  
 It's not like we're hiding a frozen corpse in the basement.  
 You're right.  
 She even showed you the baby.  
 Oh my God, I can't even imagine how many times she's taken ice cream out of that basement.  
 I mean, Jesus, if you're going to freeze your husband, at least get a freezer.  
 Do you think she killed her husband?  
 I think so.  
 If not, why hide the body?  
 Now she's only being charged with improper disposal of the body.  
 But once the body is thawed and an autopsy is done, I bet they'll find it full of arsenic.  
 What's arsenic?  
 It's just... it's just a little something evil, my love.
 Go on and play with your ball. Go on. Go on.  
 I'm trying not to let the kids know about this.  
 The kids don't need to know about this.  
 Damn it, we don't need to know!  
 Will you wait for me for a minute?  
 Hey Edie!  
 Oh, hey, Gabby!  
 What's up?  
 I've been thinking for a while, you know how I am. . .   How do you think about this?  
 Do you feel that sometimes people hate you?  
 I don't think you should feel that way because it's the way it is.  
 Since when?   When you started to do things that people hated.  
 What have I done?   Oh, I don't know.  
 The first thing I thought of was... . . dating your friend's ex-husband.  
 Oh, so the smile on your face that night was all fake.  
 You're the one who suggested that I go out with Carlos.  
 Edie, there are thousands of single men in the Scenic Area.  
 Why do you have to be with my ex-husband?   You're already engaged to someone else!  
 What do you care?   That's embarrassing!  
 It's like I donated my dress to the charity and then you showed up in it when I went to the party.  
 Again, what the hell do you care about something you've already given away?  
 Listen Edie, you go find someone who's right for you and stop picking up other people's leftovers!  
 I don't think so?  
 Then you'll have to suffer.  
 Oh, Bato.  
 You're only as tall as my leg.  
 What else can you do? 
 You'll know soon enough.  
 Who is it this time?  
 Well... . . It's Ian.  
 Do you want to talk to him about something?  
 No. He's got flowers.  
 He's got flowers, too. I don't care. They look like two dozen roses.  
 Oh, no, I hope those thorns kill him.  
 All right, Mum, I know Mikel and Ian did it wrong, but...  
 They used me as a poker bet.  
 They used a five-card hand to decide my fate.  
 "Wrong" doesn't even begin to express the extent of the evil  
 Well, well, well, but they're the only two people in the world who know all your faults and can find a way to love you.  
 Are you really going to do without both of them?  
 Yes, I do.  
 I don't need a man.
 I don't even need to make love.  
 I didn't have one for the first 16 years of my life. . . the first 16 years of my life.  
 And now, 22 years later, I can still go on like this  
 That must be very interesting.  
 What?  
 M i k e is here too  
 Let's give up.  
 She ignored you the first ten times.  
 And now she won't.  
 It's so sad.  
 You really do have that British resilience.  
 Do you know that? 
 I'm going to have to put a face on it.  
 I'd prefer the unconscious one pooing in a bag!  
 Well, you're lucky I don't have that bag with me now.  
 All right, let's do it.  
 Excuse me?  
 Guys?  Hey, my mum really wants you two to get away from each other.  
 Don't be so soft-spoken.  
 Let them know I mean it.  
 Because if you don't leave, she'll be very, very disappointed.  
 Yell at them!  
 Then you . . ...go home. Go home. Think about what you've done.  
 If you want to be more aggressive, you can do it yourself!  
 Here we go - duck ravioli with mushroom and cream sauce.  
 What do you think?   
 I think it's too bad you didn't make one for yourself.  
 Hey, love.   
 Hey, I just wanted to say I love you.  
 How sweet of you?  
 What's all that noise?  
 Are the kids still awake? 
 Yes, they don't want to sleep.  
 Of course they don't.  
 They're children. You're their father.  
 Let them go to sleep.  
 I tried to be affectionate, but they wanted to wait for you to come back.  
 They... ... They... They miss their mum.  
 Are you trying to make me feel guilty for coming home early?  
 The restaurant closes half an hour ago.  
 Please don't throw the pudding!  
 Oh, Torm. Oh... I'm sorry. I'm so sorry.  
 I can't go back right now.  
 We're, um... . ...working on the inventory so... We're doing an inventory so... . . It's going to take a while.  
 Okay, then.  
 - As soon as possible?   - I will.  
 I love you. See you again.  
 I love you.  
 I know I'm a bad person.  
 I just had to choose between motherhood and ravioli.  
 I have to--I have to go home.  
 Lynette, you have nothing to feel guilty about.  
 You've been working all day for the restaurant, and if anyone should take a break, it's you.  
 I'm being really sensible.  
 Give me some more.  
 That one too.  
 You're in here.  
 What are you doing out there?  
 There are children throwing eggs on Mrs. McClures' room.  
 Oh, my God.  
 They shouldn't have done that.  
 We should go and talk to her.  
 No. It's too late.   
 It's too late.  
 She probably doesn't want us to bother her.  
 Come on, son.  
 It's time to go to bed.  
 We have to do this - we don't talk to Edie anymore.  
 What do you mean "we"?  
 I say "we" because she betrayed me and you're my best friends, so you should support me.  
 "Support you" means. . . Like junior high school?  
 I can't believe you weren't furious about that one.  
 She was dating your ex-husband and Michael before she reached out to Carlos. 
 Yes, and you know who I blame?  
 I blame Carol and Michael.  
 How come no one is angry with them?  
 I mean, we had to deal with  
 Those men, they got away with it.  
 They're scum!  
 Well, it's still about Edie. ... ...   
 I'm not sure I would have joined forces against her.  
 Is that right?  
 I wasn't really comfortable being on your side when you and Patty Moore were arguing about the backyard fence, but I stood by you.  
 Gabby, it's not fair.  
 No one likes to reopen old scores  
 Don't make me talk about the things I did for you, okay?   
 I'm still not going to Mrs. Kim's to get SAPA just because you didn't do a good job on that wax.  
 Oh my God!  
 Can you have a problem with waxing?  
 Let her show you later.  
 But good friends don't just eat and talk together.  
 They also have a common enemy.  
 Do you support me or not?  
 Of course we support you.  
 We will be very cold to Edie  
 No, no, no.  
 Not cold, cold!  
 I want that bitch to be cold and shivering!  
 You're good.  
 You're good.  
 Do you still want me to see your book report?  
 Dad read it for me yesterday. 
 You weren't home yesterday.  
 Oh, okay.  
 Now daddy does everything  
 Why do you come home so late every day?  
 I'm too busy at the restaurant.  
 I'll be back with Dad as soon as I can. Trust me.  
 You're lying.  
 What?  
 You smile like that every time you tell a lie.  
 How can you say that?  
 It's the truth.  
 I came back late because I had too much to do and now I'm the only one who can do it. Now I'm going to buy something because I'm the only one who can go.  
 Go up there and do your homework.  
 Okay.  
 But that's your job.  
 I'm sorry.  
 Oh, hey, I'm sorry.  
 This is my parking space.  
 I parked here, so this space is mine.  
 I waited for the guy to pick his teeth and make three phone calls before I got this spot.  
 You can't just steal it!  
 It's only a parking space!  
 Don't secrete so much hormone! 
 Oh my God!
 You did it on purpose!  
 Yes, that's what I was going to do.  
 You're crazy, bitch!  
 Do you know what you're doing?  
 What are you doing?  
 What are you doing?  
 I want my parking space back!  
 Get out! 
 Get out!  
 Hi. - Hi.  
 Apologize to me.  
 Let me go!  
 Apologize!  
 Okay, okay, I apologize.  
 Say I'm a reckless, conceited bastard and I want to treat women with respect and kindness!  
 I am a reckless, conceited . ... ...   What's next?  
 Don't move!  
 Is this man trying to steal your car? 
 It's my car.  
 She tripped me and took my keys.  
 Is that so, lady?  
 Okay, you listen to him!  
 Who are you spying on?  
 I called her twice and she didn't answer.  
 Maybe something's going on.  
 Maybe she's busy.  
 Yes, it was clear right away.  
 I'm calling her now.  
 Oh my God! 
 What's wrong?  
 She's off the phone.  
 She's got me off the phone.  
 Maybe she's in trouble.  
 No, no, no. 
 It must have something to do with Gabrielle Solis.  
 She told everyone to leave me alone.  
 You're surprised?  
 I told you how she would have reacted if she knew about us.  
 What?  
 If she wants to play girlie tricks, let her play them.  
 Because I made it happen.  
 LYNETTE!  
 Hey!   Hey! Hey!  
 I just called you.  
 You did?  Must have put the phone on hold.  
 Oh, it's okay.  
 You can bring the kids to Travellers' birthday party on Saturday.  
 I'll ask the amphibian guy to bring all the snakes and lizards.  
 Oh, the kids will love it, but I've got work to do.  
 Oh, what a coincidence. I thought you were going to provide food for us.  
 Food?  
 I'll have pasta and salad for the parents and at least 20 pizzas for the kids.  
 Do you need that many?  
 Yes, you know the children.  
 If one child has a pizza party, it's good for all the other children.  
 It's a good thing for business.  
 Well, I could do with a little help.  
 Oh, I know you'll help me.  
 I know you'll help me. ... ... I love you.  
 No matter what the court report says  
 I don't have a problem with irritability.  
 I just had a bad day.  
 You threatened to cut off someone's head because of a parking space?  
 A very bad day.  
 Susan, when you lose control like that, it's usually for a good reason.  
 Is it going well at work?  
 Work is going well. 
 Why don't you just sign that document and tell the judge I'm fine?  
 What about home?  
 Home is fine too.  
 You're really wasting your time here.  
 What about your love life?  
 Cancel my lunch.  
 I have to stay here for a while.  
 Damn it, you can't hold it down. ... ...  
 I'm sorry, Patrick.  
 I thought it was those little brats who ring the doorbell and run away.  
 What do you want to say?  
 I want you to come back and look after us.  
 The new nanny is awful!  
 You've hired a new nanny?  
 Yeah, and she's giving us carrots as a snack.  
 That's not good, but... But... But... Sometimes life is like that.  
 It doesn't have to be.  
 All you have to do is tell everyone what happened to your husband and everything will go back to the way it was.  
 Have you seen the women?  
 No matter what I say, I can't escape their long tongues.  
 I'm sorry about the kids, but... . But... 
 I had to wait for this.  
 Can you imagine? !  
 See how humiliating it is to find two people you trust playing poker with you as a bet?  
 How humiliating would that be? !  
 It depends on your point of view.  
 Men have been fighting over women for many centuries.  
 I admit that the pike is not as rambunctious as the spear fight, but it does show how they feel about you.  
 The question is how do you feel about them?  
 I've said it before. . I said ... Hurt, betrayed  
 How did you feel about them before the Punch question?  
 I'm engaged to Ian. . . so . . so . ...so... ...so... It's clear that I love him.  
 What about Michael?  
 Do you love him too?  
 - Is it almost time?  
 - I loved him.  
 I still love him. I love Ian too.  
 So that means I've fallen desperately in love with two men.  
 Finally, I've found the focus of the problem.  
 Good.  
 No!   It's awful!  
 It shouldn't have happened in the first place!  
 I only let myself fall in love with Ian because I thought I'd lost Michael.  
 And then suddenly he wanted to get back together with me, and now I can't decide.  
 I agree, it's hard. 
 It's hard to break down!  
 If I had chosen Michael, then I would have been heartbroken, but I don't deserve that.  
 But how can I say no to Michael after all he's been through? 
 So you just leave them both?  
 You have to make a choice, sweetheart.  
 You have two good men, both of whom are crazy about you  
 Give up one . . ... That's a life well lived  
 Both of them give up . . ... That's really... . .  
 Silly enough? 
 Yes, objectively speaking, that's what it is.  
 Sounds great, thanks.  
 Hey, do you want to eat something other than spaghetti and pizza?  
 Is there such a thing?  
 Don't be ridiculous.  
 No, it's not mine. It's not mine. My friend Al is opening a southern style restaurant. . . 
 . he wanted some of his friends to preview the menu on Sunday night.  
 He said I could bring someone.  
 And then... . . And then... . ...then And then you want me to go with you?  
 That will be after we close the door.  
 Don't tell me you don't like southern food, then we won't be friends.  
 No, I like it.  
 It's just that... . It's just... It's just a little late for me and then... ... ...and then... 
 Oh, oh, oh, okay.  
 I just thought it would be fun.  
 Yeah, it'll be fun. It's just that it's a little hard on Sunday night.  
 I have to make lunch and check the homework. ... ...  
 Yeah, yeah, yeah.  
 Don't worry.  
 I know.  
 You're, uh, you're the first person I think of.  
 You know what? Maybe I should go.  
 Uh... . ...   It's part of the job to check the competition, isn't it?  
 Yes, of course.   
 It wouldn't be wrong to check it out.  
 I agree.  
 Hey, kids, go check out the snakes.  
 Can I get you some pizza later, please?  
 - I'll see you later.  
 - Hey, you want a quick pizza?   - Yes.  
 Here you go, Lynette!  
 What are you doing here?  
 Edie, let me take care of the food.  
 I know I'm a bitch, but please don't tell Gabby.  
 Hi Susan!  
 I've bought 30 of your books. 
 The kids can't wait for you to sign them.  
 Come on, let's go!   Come on, come on, come on!  
 Look, we're on the same boat!  
 Yeah, except I didn't know Edie was having a party in the park.  
 What if Gabby sees us?   
 I'm sure I don't have to worry.   
 I spoke to her this morning and she's going away for a whole day with Victoire.  
 Well, then, don't worry.  
 Let's go.  
 Don't you dare.  
 Hey!   What are you doing?  
 "Witch."  
 - Hey, don't fuck around!   - Why not?  
 - Because she's not a witch - how do you know?  
 How do you know? - No, no, no. Don't be a jerk.  
 Who is she, your girlfriend?   She's your girlfriend?  
 Shut up!  
 Hey, little devils!   Stop it!  
 Sorry, Patrick.  
 Are you all right?  
 If you had told everyone what you told me, nothing would have happened.  
 You can stop them.  
 Hi, Lynette, I'm Gabby.  
 I was dragged to a photo shoot, and there was no place to rest.  
 So I'm free for lunch. 
 Would you like to join us?  
 I contacted Susan, but she's not at home. It's strange. Her car is still in the driveway, and so are you.  
 Where's everybody going?  
 Get down!   Get down!   Get down!  
 Get down!  
 What's wrong with you, Lynette?  
 Gabby's here. 
 What is it? !  Didn't you say she was with Victoire?   I was wrong. 
 I was wrong. Come on, follow me. Follow me.  
 Mommy, can I play with you?  No! 
 Go ride your python!  
 Come on!  
 "Rent a reptile".  
 Okay, okay, she's circling the park.  
 Oh, I wish she'd hurry up. I'm afraid of snakes.  
 Oh, yes, but I'm even more afraid of gabby.  
 All right, all right.  
 We're almost safe. . ...  
 What's up?  
 Don't look back!  
 L y n e t t e !
 S u s a n !  
 Hi, Gab.    
 Hey, what are you two doing here?  
 Well, what are we doing here?  
 Oh, Edie asked me to provide food. It's really just for business.  
 I don't know why she's here too.  
 You're dead. I can't believe it.  
 This is a complete betrayal of our friendship.  
 She asked me to make 20 pizzas and bring them to her door, and I couldn't say no.  
 Oh, this is going to be fun!  
 Is our friendship worth 20 pizzas to you?  
 - We had a deal!  
 - Oh, come on, Gabby, be sensible.  
 You're embarrassing us by doing this.  
 - Me?   You both have to apologize to me.   
 - Don't be sensible.  
 I'll leave this party right away. If you don't come with me right away.  
 - That's the end of our friendship. 
 - Gabby!  
 Come on - why? What? !   - ! No!  
 I mean it!  
 Stop!  
 Let me down!   What are you doing!  
 Let go of me!
   Carol, let me go!  
 How dare you hold me like that!  
 You're ruining Taylor's birthday party!  
 What the hell are you doing?  
 I'm sorry. Their betrayal is driving me crazy.  
 Come on, Gabby, you have no right to interfere with who Susan and Lynette are friends with.  
 I'm here to tell you what's ridiculous is that you have no face telling me you're dating Edie! 
 That's ridiculous.  
 Oh, no.  
 Yes, I didn't even know about it until the engagement party.  
 And I didn't even see the news of your engagement to that Victoire on the TV.  
 I didn't intend to do that.  
 It was just an impulse.  
 So what did you just say about the plane?  
 - You're in love with that guy?  
 - Yes, very much.  
 That's great.  
 Are you not in love with Edie?  
 We're happy together, but we'll never be serious.  
 That's why... . ... If I'm dating and you're in love with someone else and you're getting married . ... ...  
 Please remind me why you're the one who's being so naughty?  
 I'm sorry, Carol, you should be.  
 - Hey! Hey!   - Hey! Hey!  
 How many custard pies do you want to bring home?  
 Whatever. I don't want to be tempted.  
 I'd like to bring some for Tom. . ...  
 Hi, Mrs. McCleskey.  
 Would you like some custard too?  
 I didn't come for dessert.  
 I know you're all talking about me, and I think the only way to shut you up is for me to clarify.  
 The... . . Who wants to hear some of the horrible details?  
 - I'd like to.   
 - Um... . .   Well, if you want to talk... ... . okay.  
 Well, first of all--some of you will find this upsetting, but I didn't kill Gilbert.  
 I came home from a weekend at Lagoon to find him lying dead in front of the TV.  
 The remote control was still in his hand, for God's sake!  
 It was 2am, so I decided to wait until morning to call the funeral home.  
 I went to the table to check on the situation.  
 Then I found his pension scheme and guess what?  
 He died and I wasn't a beneficiary.  
 - So who was it?   - His first wife.  
 He married that woman right after he started working. . ...only two years ago. It's only been two years.  
 We lived together for 34 years and that idiot didn't even bother to change the paperwork.  
 I didn't just lose Gilbert, I had to lose everything.  
 So I... . .   So I ... . ...  
 You hid him in the freezer and kept cashing the cheques.  
 Oh, what else could I have done?  
 And the feeling that he's still with me after a while isn't bad either.  
 I'll leave it at that. ... ...   The opposite is true.  
 The girls can spread the news around. ... . .   But some people won't need it.  
 Didn't expect me to come, huh?  
 Oh, I've called 20 times and you haven't answered. . ...yeah.   Yeah, I can't believe it.  
 Speaking of which... ... ...   It's obvious... ... ...   I have been very disturbed  
 Finally I went to see a psychiatrist  
 In fact, that's what the court wanted me to do. . .  
 ...um... . ...   I'd like to talk to you.  
 You're sure?  
 Yes.  
 I'm going to marry Ian.  
 I'm sure I've had a hard time making this decision, especially since you remembered what we used to do.  
 - Maybe it's just that time has changed.  
 I'm sorry, Michael.  
 At least I still have the memories.  
 - Are you ready to go?  
 - Yes.  
 I told Kim that she was ready to lock up for the rest of the day.  
 - Great.  
 I... I... . I ... . .   Go get your clothes.  
 - Yes, please.  
 Hi!   Do you have a table for seven?  
 - Hi!    - Hi! Hi!   
 What are you doing here?  
 The kids want to surprise you. We always eat together as a family. . What are you doing here?   How did you get here?  
 I said you couldn't drive.  
 I took a taxi. I took two doses of painkillers. How could I not?  
 - Surprised?  
 - Yes, a bit.  
 We all missed you so much.  
 Oh, I missed you too.  
 Hey, go grab a big table and I'll get Rick to make us some snacks.  
 Hey, wow. Oh, you smell good.  
 Oh, it must be the mint. 
 Smells good.  
 Hey, Kayla, you go and get a high stool for your sister, okay?  
 - Okay, who wants a pizza?  
 Oh, hey, change of plans.  
 Yeah, I can see that.  
 Bad idea.  
 But you go on. ... Oh, no.  
 Oh, no, I'll stay.   
 I'll make you a nice meal for the whole family  
 Thank you, thank you.  
 Thank you, my girl.  
 You're really taking care of me.  
 When is Lynette coming home?  
 She'll be back as soon as the pizzeria closes.  
 Is that ricec helping her?  
 It would be better if we paid him a wage.  
 I think Lynette likes him.  
 Of course. 
 He's a nice guy and he works well.  
 No, I mean she likes "him", she likes "him".  
 How can you say that?  
 It's just my opinion.  
 Okay, good evening, Dad.  
 I like to call you that, for God's sake.  
 Do you want to keep your name?  
 Because I love that name. 
 Just let me call you "my wife". 
 A relationship  
 Don't you think we'll live in a honey pot?  
 I mean, it could be so sweet that we'd get tired of it. 
 People will be throwing fruit then.  
 Oh, I have to pack this up.  
 Why don't you go upstairs and warm up the bed first?  
 You do realise we're going to be together for life, don't you?  
 I do.  
 Hi Susan, I don't want to disturb you.  
 It's just that there's so much I haven't said.  
 I... I... I...   I can't say the words "see you again in the morning".  
 No matter what, you are the most beautiful thing in my life and I want you to have a happy home  
 See you again 
 Oh, I'm Michael 
 Hi, Susan.  
 Hi Sussan. . .   I don't want to disturb you.  
 It's just that there's so much I haven't said.  
 Oh... .   I can't say the words "see you again in the morning  
 No matter what, you are the most beautiful thing in my life  
 I want you to have a happy home  
 See you again  
 Oh, I'm Michael  
 Where are you going?  
 Home. . ...   To England.  
 Back to England? 
 What's wrong?  
 Oh, it's just... . .  
 I'm not going to work or anything?  
 Ten minutes ago, we were just thinking about the future, and you were saying how happy we were to be with each other.  
 I... . ...   I saw you listen to Michael's message.  
 Oh, Ian, I made a choice.  
 But not for the right reasons  
 You're just trying to honour the promise you made to me  
 It's not like that  
 I'll forget, Mikey  
 You must forget him as soon as I know you.  
 It hasn't been going well, has it?  
 I love you  
 I know you love me.  
 But you love him a little more, don't you?  
 I don't want to feel so far away every time I look at my wife.  
 I think you're thinking about him.  
 I'm so sorry.  
 You deserve to be happy.  
 I am also  
 See you again, Susan  
 Hi, Mrs. McCleskey.  
 LYNETTE Well, our new nanny is not doing a very good job.  
 Would you like to start the journey of responsibility again?  
 Are you sure you want me, the Witch of Wisteria Lane, to look after your children?  
 My children know that you are not a witch. 
 It's bad.  
 I should have taken a staff.  
 We miss you 
 So do I.  
 But I need a pay rise  
 I'm penniless, all right?  
 I just spoke to Mrs. McCluskey and she's coming to help us with the kids again.  
 - That's great.  
 Yeah. And I've been thinking. . ...   I've been thinking... it's time for me to go back to work.  
 - What? 
 - Yes, I'm fine.  
 I should go for a walk. 
 But it's... . But...   The doctor said it would take months for you to recover, but it's only been six weeks.  
 I don't want to... . .   I can spray cheese on a pizza. 
 And... . ...   I don't want you to have to support the restaurant all by yourself.  
 - I don't mind - do I? 
  Because you said it was better than dying.  
 Yeah, I said that, but I don't want you to go back to work before you've recovered.  
 You'll get hurt again.  
 I'll be careful.  
 The best thing is that you can get rid of Rick.  
 Rick?   Why did you fire him?  
 I know he's nice, but... . .   Yeah... ...but... .   His salary affects our earnings.  
 In fact, he brings in more than his salary.  
 I mean, he's got a fan base because of all the new dishes he's cooking.  
 Is that true?  Yeah.   
 I think firing him would be a big mistake.  
 Oh, I was just thinking about it.  
 Well, don't think about it too much.  
 Take a break and get better.  
 That's what we're doing.  
 You're coming home late?  
 Most likely.   
 There's a big party at 10:00.  
 So... . . 
 I'll only see you in the morning.  
 - I've been waiting for you   
 - I'll wait for you.  
 Hi, I d a 
 What's the matter?  
 The idiot postman has mixed up our letters again.  
 Oh, poor Mr. Henry, his memory is getting worse.  
 Thanks for stopping by.  
 Hey, did you hear about Michael?  
 No. Ah, what happened to him?  
 - He's moved.   
 - Moved?  
 What does that mean?  
 Maria Clare had a sour stomach and couldn't sleep at two o'clock in the morning when she saw him packing everything.  
 That doesn't make sense.  
 Michael wouldn't have left without even saying hello.   
 He did.  
 According to Claus, something bad had happened and Mikey had to go and hide for a while.  
 It's a shame.  
 I've always liked him.  
 I wanted to be an assistant manager, but obviously... . .   I had to flirt with Mrs. Sccavo to get the job.  
 He still goes out with Edie, but everyone can see that he still loves Gabby.  
 Are you the old lady who is said to be hiding her husband in the fridge?  
 Yes, that's me.   
 Scary, isn't it?  
 Welcome to the Williamsburg restaurant. My name is Max because the hospital won't let my mother give my name as "Oops".  
 I'm going out of town for the summer. What's new?  
 What's new?   I think. . ...  
 Facebook is publicly listed and Snowden is in the snow  
 The Kardashian sisters' reality show, "KeeepUpWithin a Baby", is now a reality show for the Kardashian sisters who don't need to be followed.  
 P a u l a d e n out of work Same-sex marriage law passed by gourmet advocates Repeatedly in trouble for racially discriminatory comments A teacher in California was laid off for messing with students too  
 Jus tin bile r hit-and-run C h r i s b r o w n also hit-and-run    
 Rianna was beaten up but didn't run away (the two were reunited after a domestic violence attack by Charles Baron)  
 Oprah gives Lindsay $200,000 to get her to go on a show where Michael Douglas gives oral sex to women and gets throat cancer.  
 The situation in Egypt is in turmoil, and the child actor Bynes has made it worse with her many crazy antics in recent years, with the NSA censoring everyone's phone calls like a crazy ex-girlfriend.  
 There's the Texas woman hater (through the anti-abortion law case), the Florida black hater who beat up the black boy, Terry Van Mathien, who was acquitted of all charges.  
 And everyone is sick of everything except Angelina Jolie.  
 I mean, is there anything new on the menu?  
 I don't know. Let me ask.  
 Is there anything new on the menu that I need to know?  
 The royal treasure smiled at the queen.  
 I mean about our shop.  
 Oh, looks like we're cleaning the forks now?   Let me ask.  
 Look, Max, in one quick change, we've gone from wearing polyester and being pathetic to being proud and powerful.  
 Just like Superman.  
 But Superman changes in a phone booth, not a shop with a "Happy Hour for M a x" sign.  
 If you're not happy with it, why are you still writing it?  
 Because I don't have enough eyeliner to write "Fun Times for Cauline".  
 Look, we're wearing our "Máx handmade cupcake" T-shirts again!  
 See the logo?  
 In fact, I try not to look at the area of your girls' breasts.  
 Let me be frank.  
 Oh, Elle, you're one in a million.  
 Because 999,999 men would only look at my area.  
 I have to go home.  
 I miss growing up in Korea so much.  
 What do you miss?   Youth?  
 In my country, I'm the middle child.  
 In my head, I'm still rich and my health insurance isn't Modern Progenitor vitamin chewables.  
 Who wants to go back and see how great our new custard shop is?  
 Calm down Rachael Roy (the star of a cooking show with a lot of brain-dead fans)  
 Shouldn't get too excited about the opening tonight  
 The last time it was big, business was not so good.  
 It's like saying that people near a nuclear explosion are not doing so well.  
 Ha!
 I'm so proud of you two, girls... where you fall, where you get up.  
 After my first Jazz album failed to sell  
 I turned my life around to drinking, drugging and bimbos  
 It's funny how things work out.  
 But how did you get your egg-cake shop to open at this time of day?  
 - It's 2am - we're open from 2am to 4am  
 Our target group is the "post-bar" crowd  
 The drunken Williamsburgers  
 The same target group that I had when I was single is now the target group for my new shop.  
 It's funny how things work out.  
 We weren't expecting much from the opening tonight.  
 It's a soft opening (trial business)  
 What's the difference between soft and hard?  
 Would you like me to show him the difference?  
 Thank you, no need.  
 It really doesn't take more than a minute.  
 No need, Olég  
 Just to let you know, I'm in the mood.  
 Ready for this room to be transformed  
 - Rachael Roy again?   - Whatever you say.  
 Close your eyes before we go in.  
 I want you to have a complete experience.  
 Yes, and I want to trip you.    
 - She's joking.  
 No, she didn't. - No, I didn't.  
 I promise I won't let her trip you.  
 Close your eyes now.  
 - What's wrong?   - Now I think  
 She's going to hit me.  
 - She didn't - yes, I did.  
 No, I did. All right, enough with the closing of the eyes stuff.  
 Just show me that smelly room in the back.  
 Let me turn off the lights for a little extra drama.  
 What's wrong?   I didn't do anything.  
 It's me.  
 Now he knows what's hard.  
 I can't believe my eyes.  
 I felt the same way the first time I saw you  
 The bottles and jars are the originals, the tiles are the originals, and the tools are the originals.  
 What do you think, Olég?  
 It's good.  
 "Fine"?   You would just say "fine? "  
 This place used to be a rat adventure park!  
 They were lining up to bite us!  
 Show them their wounds.  
 - I don't want to - good?  
 This house used to smell like a suicide scene of poo.  
 Or a cesspool of death.  
 Look at what we have done!   We have created  
 We've created the best and coolest cupcake shop ever... I love it!  
 But you know, don't get too crazy, it's just a trial run.  
 And ah, thanks to you, we can rent this place for free.  
 Free rent?   Let me think back.  
 When did I ever say "free rent"?  
 At 4.00 pm on the 27th, you said  
 "I don't care about that dump, you can have it for free".  
 "It's none of my business if it burns to the ground."  
 I knew learning English would come back to bite me sooner or later.  
 Is there a knock on the door already?   It's a good sign, M.A.  
 It's open for business!  
 Look, girls, I'm blowing the trumpet for you!  
 Thank you, thank you, but we don't want to be too high profile, it's just a test business.  
 Oh, I love trial businesses.  
 - Good for you, Sophias - Oh, good for you, Olég  
 Sorry for the awkward meeting.  
 If we had known you would come and surprise us  
 - we would not have invited Olég - yes  
 I was there when you two broke up, and I'm still stuck on PTSD.   
 "Post-traumatic surreal drama"  
 There's no such thing as blood  
 The award for the best drama series will go to  
 Aren't we right, Olég?  
 Yeah, we're friends now.  
 Auntie, I cheated on you, so she broke my car window.  
 And the window of my flat.  
 And your stereo and flat screen TV.  
 And my brother's flat-screen TV and his daughter's computer.  
 Yes, she scared me. She shouldn't have been at home at that time.  
 We've resumed our goodnight friendships.  
 Goodnight Friends  
 And Olég  
 That's a good one.  
 Look, my dear, there's a visitor!  
 Hey cool guys!  
 Come and have a bite to eat at the aunty's pilot shop!   (also referred to as soft private parts. . . )  
 It's not quite what I had in mind, but I'll take it.  
 Hello there!  
 What's on offer?  
 Welcome to the McX handmade cupcakes  
 In England, we call them "fairy quiches".  
 A fairy quiche?   Damn it!  
 Why are all handsome men gay?   (faliy means gay)  
 Give us all this plate.  
 Oh my god!  
 American Express Black Card?   (The top of the range card that can supposedly be used to buy airplanes)  
 I haven't had a black one in years.  
 I'm guessing you've never held a black one.  
 Sorry, it's our first day of business, cash only.  
 This guy is a mess.  
 - What's the addiction?   - I was almost there for a while.  
 I don't know what I was doing, but I was jealous.  
 Now I'm really jealous.  
 I'm sure he'll be fine.  
 Oh, I bet he's not only going to be fine.  
 He'll be my next boyfriend.  
 Ronald, old man, get up!  
 He's not breathing.  
 I can't wake him up, call 91!  
 Call 911!  
 Everybody calm down. I've seen it happen a lot.  
 One summer I was a part-time lookout for a drug den. He'll be up soon.  
 Wrong.  
 Michael died in front of our shop last night. The guy was a rocking star.  
 He also had a relationship with Katemos.  
 No offence, but isn't it the same as the law in England to have an affair with a katie moss?  
 All men must do it as soon as they reach the age of 21.  
 His name is Rowland Glass and he has released two gold albums.  
 I can't believe I've never heard of him.  
 I believe  
 You're still listening to the "The Paperboy Chronicles" soundtrack  
 Yesterday he was a rocking star and now he's gone  
 So I ordered breakfast from the amazing breakfast place on the corner.  
 You ordered breakfast from the "Best Latte"?   I walk past that place every day and there are only two things on my mind.  
 Firstly, I want a gun (cum: to shoot sperm)  
 Secondly, one day she's going to order breakfast delivery and it has to be the best croissants.  
 Who knows, maybe I'll smoke too much tonight and die unexpectedly.  
 But at least I'll die doing what my mum loves most  
 You're right, Max, you only live once.  
 Y O L O (Y o u o n l y l i v e o n c e )  
 Next time you say "YOLO", you won't have a chance to live.  
 No, bad news again!  
 The Google newsletter for the handmade cupcakes says you have a Google newsletter for our business?  
 I only set up a Google newsletter for "Oprah Naked".  
 Not that it will happen, but if it does, I'll be the first to know.  
 It's been said on the internet that Roland Glass died in front of our shop.  
 Well, my phone died too. It's really contagious.  
 Oleg, why are you still carrying our shop's light sign?  
 Didn't you say it was already up?   I mean, I'm a big bird.  
 I can't put it up now either. There are people in front of your window.  
 Are there people in front of our windows?  
 Brother, is this the place where my rolonda hung up?  
 Yes, it's there. I'll have to put the candles here, next to Paddington Bear.  
 I found it at his last concert.  
 And picked up this herpes.  
 How could he just lie down and die?  
 He didn't die until he touched this smile first.  
 Laughing?   Sister!  
 Max, come and talk to me.  
 I'm sorry. Oh, what a nice hat.  
 Thank you, I found it in the rubbish.  
 Michael, what are you doing?  
 Don't say he hit it there.  
 We need to clear this up.  
 If we don't do it, we won't be able to do it.  
 Three dozen egg cakes for you, girl.  
 We've got to do it.  
 There's a group of guys coming to keep watch tonight. How much is an egg cake?   7 yuan  
 Why is it so expensive?  
 That's how we can rest in peace  
 * ♪ Knock, knock, knock on the door of heaven ♪  
 He hit it right before he fell down.  
 He looked at me and smiled as he fell  
 He was happy and at peace  
 Seven bucks a piece for cash only  
 I said, "Can you break a 50?  
 Max  
 Why did you call me?  
 Break a 50.  
 Okay, why, why?  
 * ♪ Knock, knock, knock on the door of heaven ♪  
 10 bucks, 10 bucks, 10 bucks, 10 bucks  
 It's almost sold out.  
 I'll have to get some more from the kitchen.  
 Okay, I'm coming.  
 Ealal?  
 Here we go.  
 The old method of giving you 30 cents for every dollar you sell.  
 What a shame!  
 Do you know how much we can make if we sell marijuana?  
 Do you want to join in too?   The old division  
 Damn, you smell like a hippie, not a shithole.  
 People are mourning. Show some respect.  
 I'm putting respect?   Respect for what?  
 What are you two going to do next?   Sell egg cakes to diabetic children in children's hospitals?  
 Do you doubt my sincerity?  
 I just kicked a homeless man off the mourning altar and he's pissed on it twice.  
 I don't care if I said those words at 4:00 p.m. on the 27th.  
 Your business is booming and I want to collect the rent.  
 You're dreaming, you, he's overdosed and dead.  
 God was kind to us and let him die in front of my window.  
 Life is short, I'll take it.  
 Y O L O  
 It's not "YOLO", it's "HDO", but I'm sorry he's going to die for once (H e O n l y D i e d O n c e )  
 Why don't you just sell T-shirts with "HODO" on them?  
 Don't you stop?  
 We're soothing a broken heart with an egg cake  
 And to tell you that we sell with respect Knock, knock, knock on the door of the Aperture Storie  
 I've had enough of making money from my business  
 must pay me the rent for 200  
 A year?  
 A month... is there such a cheap place?  
 We cleaned it too.  
 Just to show him the rat's teeth!  
 People don't want to  
 I don't care what you say, I've decided!  
 - Show him the teeth marks!   - That's it!  
 You've been bitten by a rat on your ass?  
 All right, give me 195.  
 You said no rent. You said it.  
 It's business, no personal feelings.  
 Can you understand my pain?  
 Show him the teeth marks on the front!  
 No, no, no, it's too personal.  
 - Sorry for your sacrifice - it's hard  
 - Don't comfort me.  
 Let's put some flowers there too as a token of our appreciation  
 It feels so warm  
 As if you hadn't stolen the flowers  
 It's all about the love  
 And wouldn't it be cheaper to have them in someone else's garden?  
 What about the memorial altar?  
 Don't you dare deceive me!  
 I don't care what you say!  
 * Knock, knock, knock on the door of heaven  
 Can you believe it?  
 He is rich in death!  
 Why don't you ask us to join you?  
 We're proud to present Roulad's Chicken in Los Angeles tonight!  
 We're offering $8.95 off in tribute.  
 The dark side of crickets is about to be revealed (Jiminy Creek: the little cricket from Pinocchio)  
 No way, Max. This is our memorial altar.  
 Get the bears out of here!  
 And bring back the altar of the dead?  
 I'll pay my respects later.  
 He just died here.  
 Are you going to make it or not?  
 If you do, take these poems away as soon as possible and move them back to our window without any rhyme.  
 Because it's our dead money  
 Is this a little unkind of you?  
 "In heaven, keep on rollin' the bull Kevian love you"  
 Rhymes with gold  
 Eh, I knocked over a candle Eh, I set a small fire  
 It's burning on my shoe  
 If we don't put out the fire, it'll be my memorial service.  
 Look!   Look!  
 These two girls have broken the memorial altar of a dead man!  
 Look!   A cockroach has escaped from the dining room!   Trample it to death!  
 Look, you hippies, put your pipes down and look!  
 They're disturbing the peace of the dead for their own financial gain!  
 Hey, that's not nice!  
 That's right, that's right!  
 - He's the one who's not okay!     - Yes!   Look at him!  
 Raul Arnold Glazers died a tragic death in front of our rotten pastry shop window.  
 Did you see it? "Tragic" and "lousy"?  
 That rhyme just popped out.  
 Hey, hey!  
 Hey, he knows!  
 I told him not to pee on the memorial altar in front of our window yesterday!  
 Isn't that right?  
 Yes, that's the shrew.  
 That's right!   That's right!   I'm the shrew!  
 That's not good, man.   
 Throw him out!  
 It's my wallet!  
 Stop it!   It's not my wallet!  
 Stop! Stop!  
 Stop!  
 "Stop it!   (Make up your own mind about the 2012 movie of Tony)  
 Put him down. He's not a bad guy.  
 Even dressed like this with this brain  
 Seriously, do you really have to go to such lengths to be successful?  
 Just let him be torn to pieces?  
 I'm thinking  
 I'm thinking  
 I'm thinking about it.  
 Well, now there's no one to knock on our windows.  
 There are more people lying on the doorstep after someone has died outside.  
 I thought again about what we had done today  
 How did we let Hahn live?  
 Are you here?  
 I've brought you some Starburst puddings as a thank you.  
 What's in a Starburst pudding?   Pills?  
 Broken dreams?   Tear-soaked underwear?  
 A lot of money?  
 I'm not as easy to talk to as Max (easey)  
 That's what the girls in my class in seventh grade used to say.  
 See, I was wrong.  
 No, I was wrong.  
 We should have paid the rent.  
 I wasn't talking about rent.  
 Rent?   Who said anything about rent?  
 I shouldn't have said it wasn't a private matter, it was a commercial one.  
 Stop those stinking hippies!  
 After tearing me to pieces  
 I realised that things between us were more personal.  
 Of course there was a bit of business too (a littler bit of business)  
 A little JJ, huh?   (A little bit of business.)  
 But what else could you have?  
 Max, don't be so mean to Hanan (bethard).  
 He doesn't charge us rent.  
 Who said anything about not charging rent?  
 I've come up with what I think is a good price.  
 - $250,000 - yes, that sounds right!  
 I remember when you first opened the quiche, right?  
 Then we'll talk about the rent when you get to that number.  
 How kind of you!  
 I hate to break it to you, but I hate to tell you that she just said "erection" (hald-awn).  
 Really, really, really generous of you.  
 But we're a bit sorry about that. But we're counting you in on this business?  
 I'll just wait for the rent. You're my best friends.  
 Finally, a woman was willing to give her body to him and he refused.  
 Google News  
 Oprah's breastless now?  
 Don't even think about it. It can't happen.  
 Not in your condition, of course.  
 Oh my God, the autopsy revealed that Rowland Glass choked to death on a piece of Mac's homemade cupcake.  
 That's too bad.  
 Hey, where's your excitement, Rochelle Roy?  
 This place is going to be awesome!  
 It won't be long before the cynical hipsters are lined up in front of the window shouting "Have a piece of that guy's cupcake!"  
 Open the window!   Let's get back to business!  
 But we can't expect people to die here every week!  
 I'm positive and optimistic, but you're too blind and naive.  
 You don't need to be.  
 That's the good thing about having the window.  
 Who knows what's going to happen next?  
 Yes, we don't have to go out and pull business because we're right here on the street waiting for business to come to our door.  
 The sense of possibility is so good.  
 Today it's an American Express Black Card, tomorrow it could be... . .  
 M a x won't be... . ...  
 At other times, a little greeting from a homeless person might be welcome.  
 Foreword to The First Families  
 This used to be my home, and in my absence  
 Marcel has got everything I wanted  
 I will take it back.  
 I pledge to you my loyalty  
 From now on you hold the keys to my kingdom  
 You will give me up for him once more, will you?  
 All those who love Nikolaus will be rewarded only with pain and death.  
 Nikolaus, she's carrying your child.  
 You must come with me, little wolf girl.  
 I am now under the protection of the almighty Klaus.  
 It's time for my niece Cami to leave this city.  
 Leave New Orleans and forget all about it.  
 Do I know you?  
 You've been hypnotized.  
 It's all right. I can undo your hypnosis.  
 For centuries, people have come to New Orleans in search of a new beginning.  
 Young French socialites were tricked into coming here by the promise of marriage to a nobleman of New Orleans.  
 This is the legendary Casco girl  
 They do not know that the man who awaits them is not a noble gentleman, nor a gentlemanly gentleman.  
 Let them come out. We want to see the women this time.  
 Come out, come out!  
 Come out, we want women  
 Don't be afraid of the lost lambs  
 The bad men are gone  
 We girls have to stick together and support each other  
 Okay, do you have anything to take away with you?  
 The story of the Casco girls has been passed down to the present day and is celebrated today in a form unique to New Orleans, with fashionable fancy dress and supernatural genius.  
 An annual festival to honour the women who were forced by selfish men and the stories of when they fought for themselves and won  
 Oh my God, that hurts!  
 Apologies to Cami  
 This is the only way to get rid of Klaus's hypnosis  
 I believe I know how much this hurts.  
 You'll be fine. Say you wrote these notes.  
 Don't believe me, Klaus. This is a great way to remember.  
 Nice work.  
 We've been working all night.  
 I don't understand what has happened to me.  
 I don't understand any of it.  
 But you will understand  
 I will bring back all the memories that have been taken from you and undo all the hypnosis that the bloodsuckers have put you under.  
 When it's over, you'll understand it all, and then you'll be free.  
 If you want me to stop  
 No, don't stop.  
 I want to remember everything.  
 Do you need any help?  
 You might have to use all the bloodsuckers' magical powers.  
 Please let me do it for you.  
 Thank you.  
 I don't think there are many Casco girls with big bellies.  
 I think you look very pretty in that, but I have to... . I know I have to...  
 I know I have to cover up that weird werewolf birthmark.  
 I don't think any of the rabble here would dare harm you, knowing that you are under the protection of our family.  
 But it is better to be careful  
 You've got a big belly and nowhere to go  
 So be it. . ...  
 If you'd like to join us for the festivities this evening  
 I'd be happy to take you out.  
 You and Klaus are in such a foul mood.  
 We don't want to get into trouble, do we?  
 Of course.  
 Elijah.  
 Can you help me pull down the zipper?  
 Yes, of course.  
 It's so dull and ugly.  
 Are you talking about clothes or something else?  
 Why do you ask? Is there a lack of security?  
 This holiday was created for me, so to speak.  
 I need the best clothes. Leave me alone!  
 - Becca - don't touch me  
 You've made your choice.  
 You've made your choice. You've become Klaus's best friend again.  
 You've given up the right to touch me  
 Guess who's calling?  
 What's up?  
 Something's wrong  
 Our little bird has escaped from its cage  
 You should start to feel a sense of relief  
 Your little note is much easier to understand now.  
 I promise that if only the world would stop chasing me  
 I'm sure I'll find the spell of the daylight ring finger  
 I understand you don't need to worry about that now  
 I remember why I wrote this  
 I found a picture from 1919.  
 It has Klaus and Marcel on it.  
 Klaus hypnotised me to make a date with Marcel so that I could monitor him.  
 He told me yesterday that before he made me forget everything  
 I remembered  
 Let's continue with the hypnosis we had before  
 Leave New Orleans and forget me  
 Your brother was ill at the time  
 There's no point in staying here.  
 You're not even a detective, but it's clear.  
 Our secret weapon is gone.  
 She won't just leave.  
 She knows the witch is looking for her.  
 Her little fiddle is gone too.  
 Mostly she left of her own free will.  
 What did you say to her in the attic?  
 She lied to me in order to stay there, hoping that you would help her control her powers.  
 How do we know it was you who took her away?  
 I don't know where Davina is or why she ran away.  
 And can you not come so close to me?  
 I can assure you that I would never want to see this child harmed.  
 That harvest ritual has taken too much out of her.  
 The girl you spoke of in your motherly rage is the worst witch in New Orleans.  
 If she runs away, what is to stop her from destroying us, indeed destroying all our fruits?  
 If she is not our friend, she is our enemy  
 She is our friend, Klaus  
 May it be so  
 You're lucky I know how to get her back.  
 Come with me.  
 You know how Nikolaus is.  
 If he feels threatened, he'll become cruel and ruthless.  
 That's not good for Davina.  
 I won't let anyone hurt her.  
 Neither will I  
 I hear the little witch is gone, isn't she?  
 Apparently she went out the front door.  
 Do you know what's going on?  
 I don't understand, but I did tell her that the elders were dead.  
 And what do you think she was afraid of when the witches were going to sacrifice her?  
 I think it was because Marcel didn't tell her that the barrier to her freedom had been removed.  
 So you're the one who caused her to go?  
 I'm just telling the truth.  
 It was she who realised that she was only a weapon used by them to control the witches.  
 I've never been on the same side as them.  
 See, Elijah will join them.  
 And with the three of them, it's no good.  
 Used by the witch, deceived by Marcel, manipulated by Elijah, threatened by Klaus.  
 She is the modern version of the Casco girl.  
 Are you talking about Davina or yourself?  
 Does it matter?  
 Whatever you say, we girls have to be on the same side.  
 I'm sorry for the disturbance.  
 I've been calling you for an hour.  
 I thought you'd understand.  
 You've been in such a state of confusion since Agnes died.  
 Can you blame me, though?  
 There doesn't seem to be much to do these days.  
 But while you were holding on to all the walking [men] to hide your pain  
 I've been looking around, keeping a low profile, listening for news.  
 The daywalkers of Marseille are going up and down the city  
 Look for a girl with brown hair and blue eyes  
 I think I know her.  
 If Davina isn't with Marcel, then he has no way of knowing we're doing it.  
 And if we can find her, we can fix everything.  
 The sun will be searching for more and more bloodsuckers in the lower mountains.  
 I found this one in the old room of her house.  
 Is it possible to see where she is?  
 Keep drinking.  
 You need vervain in your system so you don't get hypnotized anymore.  
 Cami, do you have any blood bags in the fridge?  
 Why would there be? Here.  
 Davina.  
 Someone's doing a spell.  
 They're looking for me.  
 Then we must leave immediately.  
 I can't escape now.  
 Everyone is looking for me  
 Witch Marcel Kraus  
 My uncle will find a way.  
 - Cammy - he knows what's going on here  
 - He knows what's going on here.  
 Unless he's hypnotised too.  
 He knows all about it.  
 What are you talking about?  
 He knows.  
 He and Marcel are together.  
 They could be considered friends.  
 I can hear them talking.  
 He knows everything.  
 No, he wouldn't.  
 If he knew that the witch had cast a spell on my brother, he would have told me.  
 Does he really know?  
 Cammy!  
 Oh, my God.  
 He knew all along.  
 You should really go, now.  
 Feel free to take any plane, train or bus.  
 My car is for you. It's parked at the top of the yard.  
 I'll give you a message with the exact location.  
 Put your number in Cammy's phone  
 Most of the French Quarter has been closed  
 We'll have to walk and the sun won't set  
 Don't cry.  
 As soon as it's dark, you'll join us.  
 Okay, don't worry about me.  
 Don't let them find you  
 I know Klaus told you to follow me, but did you really have to follow me to the bathroom?  
 Call Sophie Devereaux, give me two minutes.  
 It's my OB/GYN.  
 What the hell do you want?  
 I know you don't trust me, but you have to listen to me.  
 Everything can change.  
 Davina has been given her freedom.  
 You've done your homework, haven't you?  
 But what does that have to do with me?  
 I need your help to get the witches to complete the harvest ritual.  
 Am I sick? Why should I help you witches gain more power?  
 You have been casting a spell on me.  
 If we don't complete the harvest ritual we will lose our powers forever, and that is not good for your family.  
 How do you know about my family?  
 You are a member of the Crescent Wolves.  
 Marcel had a witch cast a spell to keep them in wolf form only.  
 Give me a reason to stay on the phone.  
 Because the witch who cast the spell was my ancestor  
 You help me with the harvest ritual and I will help you break the spell.  
 But what can I do?  
 I need to sacrifice the body of a powerful witch in order to draw their power.  
 I know of a witch whose body has never been found.  
 Her name is Celeste Doble.  
 You should have a friend in common.  
 Elijah  
 It is said that after her death, Elijah buried her in a secret place, as she wished.  
 All I need is for you to find that place.  
 Now there are people everywhere  
 Keep walking and no one will find you.  
 Cami!  
 We need to get off this street.  
 If anything happens, Kieran will call me.  
 You two look very comfortable together.  
 No, I just told Ilya we're wasting our time.  
 Don't you like festivals?  
 Why not?  
 Why not? The street markets are so busy.  
 Sister, are you here to help us find someone?  
 You can't let your secret weapon fall into the hands of someone else, can you?  
 Just to let you know, we'll find her soon.  
 That sounds familiar to me, Nikolaus.  
 It's clear you harbour some nefarious conspiracy.  
 What is it?  
 Timothy.  
 Can I talk to you for a minute?  
 Cammy, it's me who's bothering you again.  
 I just want to know where you are so that I can meet you before sunrise.  
 Hello, Joshua.  
 Joshua, the most disappointing slave I've ever had.  
 If I had called you, you wouldn't have answered.  
 Klaus, how are you?  
 Guess what? I've moved to Turkey.  
 It's strange that the Turks don't eat turkey.  
 - You're lying.  
 Marcel and I were just saying that you, the double agent, had been exposed and that, according to our analysis, you should still be in town and with someone.  
 A young, angry witch.  
 No, no, there's no witch here.  
 But the turkey is good.  
 Are you sure you want to leave Davina's true love, Mr. Timothy, alone with me?  
 Josh, what would she think?  
 I promise I just want to talk to her.  
 I'm waiting for you at the house with Tim.  
 I really hope she comes home soon.  
 We should go on. How long do we have to wait?  
 Just a few minutes.  
 Then I'll go and see if the coast is clear.  
 Josh, I'm sorry I missed your call.  
 What?  
 I didn't want to tell you at first, but I knew Klaus.  
 If Davina hadn't shown up, he would have killed Tim.  
 We'll think of something.  
 You go to the French Quarter and make sure you don't get caught.  
 We'll think of a way to send you a text message.  
 - I'm going to find him - Davina, wait, wait  
 I can't let Tim die.  
 What's wrong?  
 The witches!  
 No!  
 Cammy!  
 I'm just going to get some clothes.  
 Give me two minutes, will you?  
 Celeste fascinates me.  
 She's flawless.  
 She's dead  
 Even if the sun rises, all I see is night  
 But I promised her that if she died I would bury her far away from all the chaos, from witches and bloodsuckers and all the people.  
 I'm sorry, Elijah.  
 Don't be nervous. It's me. Don't do anything to me.  
 What are you doing here?  
 You should have hid.  
 Yes, but so should you.  
 But that "I want revenge" look on your face makes me very worried.  
 Are you sure you want to mess with the most evil man in history?  
 He took Tim first and provoked me.  
 I will kill him and all of them!  
 Davina, the Patriarch, is unkillable.  
 Perhaps it is possible.  
 I have infinite power.  
 I have never felt more powerful than I do now.  
 That power is building and growing inside me.  
 I am strong, Josh.  
 If you kill them, then what?  
 What?  
 If you really want to do this, then do everything you can.  
 Use all the power you have against them.  
 Sweet, you won't tell Davina that if she kills Klaus, you will die with her.  
 It's too noble to tell Davina that if she kills Klaus, you'll die with her.  
 The question is, if she does go after my brother, she will be the one who dies.  
 A more tragic ending to an already tragic story.  
 Perhaps you'd like to help me with her.  
 Where has Rebecca gone?  
 I'm not worried, Rebecca. How can you be sure that Davina will come?  
 To say that would make people think you've forgotten what it's like to be in the throes of a crazy obsession.  
 She will come.  
 Do you need to be so melodramatic, Nikolaus?  
 You have a point.  
 Timothy, could you please play something a little more pleasant?  
 That's a good boy.  
 It's been a long time since you were asked to spread the word.  
 Have you seen his nightwalkers?  
 They're not very bright.  
 Anyway, I've done my job.  
 When Davina arrives, you two must let me talk to her.  
 You'll have your chance.  
 You're so sweet.  
 Silence is golden. Thank you, Timothy.  
 Davina  
 I'm already here. Tell him to come down.  
 Then you and I must first talk about your return to us.  
 Do you remember what I said, Klaus?  
 Let me come, Davina. What's going on?  
 Why did you run away? Tell me.  
 I can help you with all of this.  
 How? By threatening my friend's life?  
 In fact, it was my idea. I'm sorry.  
 Sometimes I go a little overboard to make a point.  
 But it does work.  
 You act like you're so confident, but the truth is  
 You're afraid to let anyone see you for what you really are, the beast you are.  
 A beast.  
 Why don't you show us who you really are?  
 I've had enough of you.  
 Davina, you don't have to do this.  
 You...  
 You lied to me in front of me, pretending that you were trying to help me.  
 Listen to me.  
 You claim to be a noble man, but like your brother, you are a murderer.  
 For a thousand years you have fed on the blood of innocent people.  
 Let you try what it is like to choke on blood.  
 As for you  
 I trusted you so much  
 I loved you, but you only used me to consolidate your power.  
 You don't care about me.  
 You were wrong.  
 When you lost to Klaus, you handed me over to him as a trophy.  
 Perhaps I should have thrown you into the boiling copper  
 I care for you  
 I treat you like my own  
 No way, my love.  
 Don't tell me you believe him.  
 Shouldn't we have a nice little chat, girls?  
 It's very impressive, and if you ask me, they all deserve it.  
 Before you turn on me  
 I have a surprise for you.  
 Josh, what are you doing here? Come on, let's go.  
 What are you doing?  
 If I were Klaus, I would turn  
 If I were Klaus, I would have twisted Josh's head off and fed it to the nightwalkers, which is what happened to your friend.  
 But hurting others is something only boys like to do.  
 It's like how Klaus hypnotised the "little fiddler on the roof"... I may be unpredictable, but I'm definitely not like my brother.  
 It's all right, Timothy. You can come down now.  
 No one is going to hurt you.  
 He said he wouldn't let me climb down from the beam.  
 Then don't climb, you idiot!  
 Am I the only one here with a brain?  
 Davina, how did you do it?  
 How did I get here?  
 I'll explain. I promise.  
 Why are you doing this?  
 It seems to me that you are in control of the whole situation, but you don't know who to trust.  
 I have proved to you that you can trust me  
 Now I want to show you one more thing.  
 It won't take long.  
 You can take your friends with you.  
 Sophie, I've told you everything.  
 You said he buried her between two lovely oak saplings.  
 That was two hundred years ago.  
 They're big trees now.  
 You want to be an all-powerful witch, then keep looking.  
 Say a prayer. Have some faith.  
 You can do it.  
 Okay.  
 Please help me.  
 I'm trying to do the right thing  
 Don't worry.  
 They're not really dead, they're just hungry, and that doesn't make it any better.  
 Do you think my brother Nik is bad?  
 Marcel studied under him.  
 This is what he did to his so-called friends who betrayed him  
 Most of the poor fellows here would have done no more than Josh did.  
 Like Thierry  
 He was Marcel's most trusted friend.  
 Claude induced him to break one of Marcel's rules  
 Marcel knew this and still kept Thierry  
 He was locked in here day and night.  
 It's madness.  
 Why are you telling me this?  
 Because you know who you have to deal with and who you can trust.  
 It's okay.  
 You'll be fine.  
 Here, have some water.  
 Davina, you and I, we've both been tricked, used by Marcel and Klaus.  
 Maybe if we join forces we can give them a little revenge.  
 Everyone!  
 Tim!  
 He made me do it, Klaus.  
 I didn't even know what I was doing before, did I let you  
 What did I make her do?  
 Drink.  
 Tim?  
 Klaus poisoned the water.  
 Tim?  
 Davina  
 No!  
 Cammy, are you okay?  
 Have you eaten today?  
 You must have passed out.  
 Yes, perhaps I was mysteriously knocked out by three witches.  
 Where's Davina?  
 Does your friend Marcel know she's here?  
 Cami, I can explain.  
 Bloodsucking witches  
 My brother, your nephew is under the spell of a witch.  
 How could you have kept this from me?  
 It's complicated.  
 There are so many things you don't understand  
 You hide the truth from me  
 You made me believe that Sean was mad, that I was mad, instead of telling me the truth.  
 I was protecting you.  
 You saw what happened to Sean.  
 Cami Battista!  
 Stay away from me.  
 You're as bad as the rest of the monsters in this town.  
 Isn't that awkward?  
 Rebecca, where are you?  
 I'm with Davina, and she's dying because of your betrayal.  
 I tried to get her to stop admiring Marcel so much, but she made it clear that she wasn't our friend.  
 If you think she is your friend, then I regret it.  
 Tell me what I must do to save her  
 The blood of a bloodsucker does not work  
 Yes, it won't work.  
 The poison I made Timothy give her was very effective.  
 It's only a matter of time before she dies.  
 It's the two of them, you cruel bastards!  
 They were children.  
 We could have dealt with her fairly.  
 There is no need to talk about deals with people who threaten us.  
 Davina's fate was sealed from the moment she confronted me.  
 It was her choice, not mine.  
 Don't be like that.  
 The stench you accuse me of is overwhelming.  
 Do I need to remind you that Davina is bigger than all of us?  
 I just did what I had to do.  
 Don't worry, Elijah. I'm still as redeemable as ever.  
 So you controlled that boy to poison Davina without asking Marcel and me?  
 Do you know what the worst problem is?  
 It's that you're so easy to see through.  
 I can't help but make an alliance with your brother. I don't like him at all.  
 You sound like you have something you want to tell me.  
 You're right.  
 Kieran called me earlier, just after Sabine and the other witches had done something to Davina.  
 Hello.  
 Let me guess the protection spell?  
 Do you think I'd waste a day of magic doing nothing?  
 They should have done the same.  
 You've broken my rules, Sabine, and by my reckoning, your protection spell should be a one-time thing.  
 I give you two choices, you can go and keep company with your friends immediately or you can cast a similar protection spell for one of my witch friends.  
 You probably know who I am talking about.  
 So when you claim to have gone to see the condition of a nocturnal bloodsucker, you were actually conspiring with a witch.  
 Very clever.  
 I should be proud of myself.  
 I was really just trying to  
 As Elijah predicted, you are beginning to reveal your true nature.  
 But this time you have chosen to make an alliance with a witch, who I know has always been our enemy, a threat to our family.  
 Davina is Marcel's family, Niklaus, but you want to take her life, haven't you forgotten that?  
 Call Rebecca.  
 Tell her that Davina will be restored.  
 Unfortunately, the boy won't survive.  
 Tim!  
 Tim! Tim! Tim!  
 Tim, Tim, wake up! Wake up! Wake up!  
 Open your eyes! No! No!  
 Come on, wake up!  
 Don't leave me alone!  
 Is she all right?  
 She's broken and exhausted.  
 Where's her room?  
 Leave it to me.  
 I'll do it.  
 Some people say it's a man's world, and sometimes it is.  
 Many a Casco girl has been rescued, but there is a limit.  
 She will never trust me again.  
 Maybe.  
 But you must never give up on regaining her trust.  
 But women are actually more rebellious than the world can imagine  
 What are these paintings?  
 She had been drawing them in the attic when she felt the magic, and they were different.  
 These she called evil.  
 And some of the women  
 You could say that those who had oppressed them had better be careful.  
 Surprised to see me?  
 After all, you had a mind to control me and keep me away.  
 You remember  
 It's all about the release of control  
 It hurts like hell, but it's worth it.  
 It made me understand why I wanted to stay.  
 By the way, Klaus, if you ever hurt Davina and Josh again, I'll expose you to the world and you can kiss the French Quarter goodbye.  
 Good evening.  
 I am also rebellious and have had enough of being oppressed.  
 For a thousand years, my brother has done whatever he wanted, without any concern for the consequences.  
 Marcel seems to have acquiesced, while Elijah stays by his side, foolishly waiting for him to change someday.  
 Men are dicks.  
 What do you want me to do?  
 Even though you warned Marcel, he seems unable to give up on my brother.  
 They ruled this city side by side, but left you to rot here.  
 I want you to help me take back New Orleans so they can watch, and I have a secret weapon and a mole.  
 She was a very rebellious girl herself.  
 Are you all right?  
 I'm much better now.  
 How are you today?  
 It's not good.  
 What are these drawings?  
 Davina's sketches  
 I don't know if they represent something or not  
 They seem to be a sign of something to come  
 It seems like a bad omen.  
 Oh my God, isn't that  
 Hello, Celeste.  
 Come on, Sophie, pick up the phone.  
 My brothers and I are the first bloodsuckers in history.  
 The earliest bloodsuckers were the original family.  
 Three hundred years ago we helped found New Orleans.  
 Now we have returned to this warring city.  
 The Bloodsucker Marcel led an army against a group of desperate witches.  
 My brother Klaus is against both of them, thirsty for power and wanting to protect the werewolf who carries his child.  
 But Marcel had an advantage. He captured our brother Elijah with the help of a secret weapon.  
 Now, in order to save my beloved brother  
 I had no choice but to support the brother I could not trust.  
 August 1359  
 I have noticed a difference between my brother and sister  
 The bond between us was tightened by the pressure of the bloodsuckers' lives  
 Once the demons of the bloodsuckers took hold of us, we became more and more distant from humanity.  
 My beloved sister Rebecca is becoming more and more cold and unfeeling.  
 But it is Nikolaus who is the most problematic.  
 He still hides his loneliness with his cruelty  
 But I still believe that I, as their elder brother, can lead them back to the right path, guided by the power of the family.  
 If I fail, our family will fall into the darkness.  
 I can't believe you didn't wait for me to take care of those bloodsuckers myself.  
 I know I love to burn everything.  
 Should I leave them in the front yard to rot?  
 Then again, they are my responsibility.  
 They attacked the helpless little pregnant woman who was carrying my child.  
 I am so moved by your duty to the new father of the werewolf who is carrying your half-breed child.  
 I am so touched!  
 A wolf girl wants to know what the plan is.  
 It depends on what you are talking about.  
 Is it my plan to rule the world or is it Rebecca's plan to find true love in a cruel world?  
 The plan to rescue Elijah, you know, the good brother.  
 The one you put a dagger in the back of, the one who is now under the control of your sworn enemy.  
 To be clear, from before  
 You two said you'd get him back.  
 So, do you have a plan now?  
 Well...  
 First of all, Marcel is not my mortal enemy.  
 He's my friend, even though he doesn't realise I'm trying to break his hold on the whole supernatural zone, but still, he's a friend.  
 Secondly, I daggered Elijah in order to win Marcel's trust.  
 If I had known that he was going to let my brother be controlled by a particularly irascible teenage wizard  
 I would have considered making a slightly different choice.  
 The third point, as you requested, was that Nikolaus would ask Marcel directly for Elijah.  
 That's not the whole plan, is it?  
 Baito.  
 Claus may not have been a very good brother, but he had no more bad intentions.  
 This is the only plan.  
 But there is always a backup plan.  
 What's the alternative plan?  
 I'm so handsome in a suit  
 Joshua Rosen is 18 years old and in the news, a tourist is missing. ... ...  
 I will voluntarily come forward as a witness under the hand of the head of the code to testify that he saw  
 These two drunken men fell into the Mississippi River and they will be investigated for weeks.  
 No one will be around to see them.  
 Well, that's good, considering one died in a bin behind the county morgue and the other is now a bloodsucker.  
 Anything else?  
 Please let me love you  
 One more thing  
 I sent out four nocturnal bloodsuckers to investigate a werewolf that had been spotted in the legal district.  
 I haven't heard from them since.  
 That's a total of 10 dead night vampires last week.  
 Do you think the werewolves are back here trying to cause a nuisance?  
 I know you and Klaus were friends.  
 But the truth is, ever since the Originals showed up, shut up, Thierry.  
 You're not still mad at me for the little poisoned werewolf bite I gave you earlier, are you?  
 I thought that was a thing of the past.  
 I see you've given him free rein in the area now too.  
 It's all right. Think of it as my family and me.  
 It was my family and I who lived here and built this place, in fact.  
 Come on, don't be like that.  
 You both know the rules  
 Thierry is my man, a close friend.  
 Klaus was my old friend and loyalist  
 And a guest here.  
 Is it all right to live together in peace? Is it all right?  
 What do you need, brother?  
 I think my sister, Rebecca, insisted that I return to Elijah.  
 She was very angry about it.  
 Of course  
 There's going to be three patriarchs in town soon, isn't there?  
 Half of us think his sister killed the Night Vampire.  
 Is that an accusation against an ancestor?  
 Didn't I just say that we should live together in peace?  
 Come with me.  
 Come with me.  
 Your crony lacks a sense of secrecy.  
 He's a little overprotective, but he's very loyal.  
 I saved him in the forties when I found him outside a veterans' hospital, dying of a war wound.  
 He would have killed for me. He would have died for me.  
 And the boy who played the trumpet was so good  
 Maybe we'll see if we can get him to play at the party tonight.  
 You'll be here, won't you?  
 How could I miss the chance to meet a councillor who has received a huge donation from you?  
 He's a dumbass, but he allows us to do our own thing for some community service.  
 Like not pointing our fangs at the local people.  
 Listen  
 I'd love to help you out with your brother, but Thierry's right.  
 My people are tense and unsettled  
 They saw the Patriarchs come back here with dead bloodsuckers and it made them very nervous.  
 If I give you Elijah now, it might give them the wrong impression that they don't know who's the real boss around here.  
 You know what I mean.  
 You must understand. I must not say anything.  
 How long does it take Klaus to ask a simple question for Mary Magdalene [the whore]?  
 It takes longer than you think, because the answer is, as expected, a no-go.  
 Marcel's men, Thierry, were suspicious.  
 He was definitely the one you killed 10 nocturnal bloodsuckers.  
 Lying. I only killed eight.  
 Should I have made Thierry the ninth?  
 Marcel is pretending to be friendly.  
 We can't kill his favourite son, or he'll turn on us.  
 - Then let's go to war.  
 Do you know what to do with the witch?  
 - I think so.  
 You deal with Sophie Devereaux.  
 I'll be responsible for the next step.  
 I order you to bleed him dry.  
 What took you so long?  
 I'm sorry, I'm not some medieval torture expert.  
 What did he do to you after all?  
 It's not about what he did.  
 It's what he'll do when we're done, which is whatever I want him to do, just like you.  
 Like stabbing him in the body with this.  
 That's crazy.  
 I didn't want to do it, but I did.  
 It's called mind control.  
 Bloodsuckers can control people.  
 Ancestors like me and my brother and sister can control bloodsuckers, and no one can control ancestors.  
 Do you understand? Good.  
 That's why a brand new nocturnal bloodsucker like you is here, unnoticed by anyone, doing my bidding.  
 But my blood has never run dry.  
 Yes, then, young Joshua, because I had control over you before you had a trace of vervain in you.  
 Vervain stops control  
 Marcel had all his companions start drinking vervain when I came back.  
 That is why our friend needs to be drained of blood so that I can control him to do my bidding.  
 Now that my brother is in captivity awaiting my rescue  
 We can't be so gentle.  
 I'm glad you're here.  
 While you dawdle    
 Elijah lies rotting with a dagger in his head.  
 You're lucky I'm here.  
 What do you want?  
 Last night, Haley was attacked by Marcel's men because someone told him they saw a werewolf in the French Quarter.  
 She'd only been to one place.  
 Whoever saw it, she sold her.  
 Watch and learn.  
 - Hello Sophie - Hello Katie  
 It's full of marigolds, very attractive to the opposite sex, very good for you.  
 I'm deeply suspicious.  
 Do you have any others? Yes... I don't know.  
 I don't know. Maybe it's a crocus.  
 Why do you want that one?  
 Don't play dumb with me.  
 Rebecca.  
 I only sold some herbs to the werewolf, that's all.  
 Are you lying to me, Katie?  
 I suggest you answer my questions honestly.  
 Answer her questions, Katy Baito.  
 Yes.  
 I told someone else, but you don't understand.  
 I love him.  
 Tell me who your bloodsucking lover is.  
 Shall I count down?  
 Hurry up!  
 I have a whole army to build. A controlled servant is not an army.  
 What about it?  
 You're right. Who's the traitor?  
 Fortunately, she's just a child who doesn't know anything about us or what we're up to.  
 Do you want to hear the thing that would make you happiest?  
 Please tell us.  
 She was in love with one of Marcel's cronies.  
 Guess who?  
 Right hand, right arm, right hand.  
 Two extra points for a correct answer  
 Thierry is getting closer and closer to his enemies.  
 That means he's unwittingly becoming the key to our whole plan.  
 I said it would make you happy.  
 In a city where bloodsuckers and witches are pitted against each other, bloodthirsty and in love.  
 It's a shame.  
 Are you crazy?  
 - No, it's easy.  
 We just need you to cast a small, very small locator spell to help us find our brother.  
 Any witch in town who uses magic will be caught and killed.  
 Yes, that's right.  
 It seems you left out an important detail in our dealings.  
 Marcel's secret weapon. He knows how witches use magic.  
 Such a tall girl is cute and easy to get mad at.  
 Davina  
 Where did you see her?  
 I don't know.  
 That little brat erased my memory after she threw me out of the window with the idea that she deserved to die.  
 Let me get to the point.  
 Elijah on Davina's hand  
 You witches, I think, would like to separate Davina from Marcel.  
 We don't know where she is.  
 That's why we need magic.  
 Davina will feel it.  
 Except, of course, for the other witch.  
 For example, for a traitor  
 Like Katie  
 while casting a more powerful spell  
 That would create a fog that would hide your little spell from Davina.  
 Katie should not have died.  
 Sophie Devereaux  
 You can't be so principled.  
 No battle can be won without a strategic loss, no matter how deplorable that loss may be.  
 How often do bloodsuckers get ahead of the game and learn things they shouldn't know?   
 Your sister was executed in a public square for using magic... who knew she was going to be caught first?  
 Did she try to get away?  
 She was hiding in the hold of a cargo ship and was caught just as it was about to set sail on the Mississippi River.  
 And who asked you to tell me that one of Marcel's most important confidants was in charge of his yard business?  
 Katie's boyfriend, Thierry.  
 You're right. He was right.  
 Right? I call him the musician.  
 The girls love him, but he's got his heart set on something else.  
 He always surrounds himself with his beautiful little witch and says he loves her, but I don't know.  
 Your most important warrior and your enemy are so close you don't care  
 I do, of course, but Thierry is a grown man now.  
 He'll make his own decisions and I'll get some important information.  
 Besides, he wouldn't do anything to jeopardize our business.  
 You see, a bloodsucker is running an extravagant charity party.  
 We're a whole lot of people here, and no one's going to break it.  
 But...  
 Wouldn't you want those witches to be too bold, considering that a witch said there were werewolves in town?  
 That led to the disappearance of your nocturnal bloodsucker.  
 I'm sure you've considered the possibility that it might be a trap.  
 Perhaps it's time I gave a hint.  
 Thierry.  
 Take a team of nocturnal vampires to the witch's place tonight for a little disturbance.  
 Thierry needn't be too polite.  
 So then I moved back here to be closer to my brothers, because  
 To be honest, family is the most important thing, right, Camille?  
 Call me Cammy. I'll have to change that badge.  
 Drunk people like to talk to me in French.  
 Have you really never been here before?  
 You look familiar.  
 You must have seen me walking around outside.  
 Aren't you meeting Marcel Gerard?  
 He's a friend of mine, sort of.  
 I heard he liked the blonde bartender back in Rousseau.  
 I wouldn't call it a date.  
 He's after me, sort of.  
 I don't know.  
 He's very attractive.  
 Which probably means I should get out of here.  
 I'm in a bit of a break-up situation myself.  
 That's the worst, isn't it?   
 There's something you can't let go of, even though you won't fall for it.  
 I like you, Cami.  
 Most girls are annoyingly whiny and sarcastic.  
 Thank you.    
 I'm supposed to be at this extravagant charity party this evening hosted by this charity house.  
 He's a bit like Gatsby organising a shitty party.  
 Interested?  
 Sister  
 Brother, I believe I have a guarantee.  
 Marcel will be a bit distracted this evening.  
 Should I ask?  
 I can only say that his attention will not be on us  
 I've done my bit.  
 What are you doing to ensure the safe return of Elijah?  
 Now, I'm preparing an insurance policy to protect against the soft-hearted.  
 What do you mean?  
 We need to make a suitable motive for Katie to cast a strong spell tonight.  
 I'm working on the motive.  
 Marcel gave the order to disturb the witch.  
 No.  
 I'll just turn around and arrange for things to go tragically wrong.  
 Do you know what you're doing?  
 No questions  
 What's going on outside?  
 It was Klaus.  
 He gave Marcel the impression that the witch was planning to take action against him.  
 Marcel wanted us to give a hint if he thought I was favouring him because I was in love with a witch.  
 Say it again  
 I love you, Katie, and everything will be all right, I promise.  
 Marcel might not care about Thierry, with all that you and me.  
 I've already been there.  
 But there are still sins for him  
 Not so easy to forgive  
 Thierry  
 Let her go! Get out!  
 Killing one of your own colleagues is one.  
 That would be inexcusable.  
 If Katie wants to save her lover from Marcel's punishment and wants to save him  
 But then again  
 What is worth giving one's life for other than love? 
 I have to say that the soundtrack is very appropriate for this evening  
 What is she doing here?  
 What better way to distract Marcel's little human girlfriend than to put him in a place where bloodsuckers are all over the place?  
 You're so sweet. You're so beautiful.  
 This party is ridiculous, but I think I'm going to enjoy it slowly.  
 He's the notoriously unpredictable family man.  
 In fact, the one you're talking about is my brother, and my sister is right.  
 You are very beautiful.  
 And you look great in that outfit.  
 Don't be fooled, my dear.  
 I'm a wolf in sheep's clothing  
 You two talk. I'd like some wine.  
 - Shall we dance?  
 - Yes, please.  
 Scotch, thank you.  
 Did you invite her here to make yourself desirable?  
 I think she's very precious.  
 I dare say it is her pure heart that you love.  
 Maybe one day I'll feed it to you myself  
 You look so good when you're jealous, Rebecca.  
 The person Rebecca was talking about  
 I think it should be Marcel.  
 I wouldn't have thought about it so much if it was.  
 It's an old story.  
 I was thinking about your sister being a bitch.  
 I think she even coined that word.  
 Listen.  
 Allow me to step away for a moment.  
 Cammy  
 Killer dance party  
 It's for business.  
 I was going to invite you... . ...nothing.  
 Nothing, it was just a date.  
 There's no need to explain anything  
 You do your thing and I'll enjoy myself  
 Why do I leave you alone?  
 Seeing you with someone else  
 Don't even think about it  
 You shouldn't have come here.  
 Who are you?  
 I'm sorry. I didn't mean to scare you.  
 I'm Sabine. We've met.  
 I'm Sophie's friend.  
 You're the witch here.  
 Sophie asked me to come over and keep you company while everyone else was out playing.    
 It was drawn to the child in your belly by you.  
 Half bloodsucker, half werewolf.  
 You and Klaus have created a very special thing.  
 You speak like Elijah.  
 He thought that this child would make a big happy family for us, but he is no longer here. . .  
 I don't even know what it is... . . what it was.  
 What is it?  
 Listen, if you want, I can help you.  
 I mean, help you know if it's a boy or a girl.  
 I thought you couldn't use witchcraft here.  
 It's not witchcraft. It's just an old trick. My nanny taught me.  
 Come on.  
 You must be a bit curious. 
 I thought you said you were in community work.  
 Community fundraising  
 You run parties and get people to open their wallets and give money.    
 That's what I do.  
 I'm probably what you'd call a bad but essential person [evil].  
 What about Rebecca? Is she one of your donors?  
 She's an old friend.  
 Not too old, either.  
 She looks younger than me.  
 You'd be amazed.  
 I was just a child when I met her.  
 Don't talk about her anymore  
 I just want to be with you.  
 You really are a horrible little devil, aren't you?  
 No, they're perfect for each other.  
 You want to split Marcel's heart, that's it.  
 I should go.  
 Excuse me.  
 What the hell did you do?  
 Don't say it here. 
 Say it somewhere else.  
 I know you think he's a beast.  
 How can I not think it's important?  
 Thierry has killed another bloodsucker.  
 He broke the most important rule in Marcel.  
 You'll never see him again.  
 Unless we do something.  
 "We"?  
 I want to save my people.  
 Do you want to save Thierry?  
 There is only one way to achieve both of these goals  
 Are you ready?  
 Something's going to happen to Marcel.  
 Magic.  
 I want to hear what you have to say.  
 Marcel, don't do this.  
 Your copy says  
 We were throwing pots and pans at the time.  
 That man, some nocturnal bloodsucker, attacked Katie for no apparent reason.  
 His name was Max. I turned him.  
 He didn't need any reason.  
 She was a witch and he was a bloodsucker.  
 And now he's dead.  
 I didn't mean to.  
 You've broken my most important rule.  
 Damn it. How long have we been friends? Seventy years.  
 I have.  
 I turned you into an immortal.  
 I gave you a gift.  
 I have been faithful to you, and I am still faithful.  
 I am still your friend, Marcel.  
 I swear it hasn't changed.  
 You're right, my love.  
 He's got a temper, hasn't he?  
 Perhaps now I should remember that I knew it would be like this.  
 We found this at his girl's place.  
 Still my friend, are you?  
 That's funny.  
 Because your little witch has the spell I've been keeping locked up in her hand.  
 Marcel, I've never seen this one before.  
 Shut up!  
 I see you're still wearing the daylight ring I gave you on your hand.  
 Why do you need the secret recipe for the ring? Unless you're going to betray me and Katie and start a new family?  
 No, Marcel.  
 Let me teach you what it means to be a friend.  
 A friend will not deceive me, break my rules, or steal what is mine.  
 For the crime of conspiring to kill his companion  
 I sentence Thierry Van Schoo to be imprisoned in the garden for 10 years.  
 It's showtime!  
 Your decision is correct  
 This is the only way to find Elijah.  
 I just did what I had to do.  
 No, Katie.  
 It's about time.  
 Hurry up!  
 No.  
 Are you here to save your man?  
 Come on, you little girl!  
 Go to hell, you bitch!  
 No, Katy!  
 Something's not right.  
 Katie's magic has stopped.  
 I can continue.  
 No, she'll notice.  
 I can find Davina. Just give me a little more time.  
 You may fight to get your witch back, but Hayley and the children will follow you to their deaths.  
 Elijah will never forgive us for saving him and it will be meaningless.  
 It's over. We've failed.  
 No, Katie, no, no, no.  
 No! No! No!  
 Tell me.  
 Is she worth it?  
 I love him.  
 Seal him up and let him rot here.  
 How much did Kemi see?  
 All she saw was a fight, man.  
 There's nothing you can't handle.  
 You really like her, don't you?  
 I like that she's not involved in all this.  
 Sometimes it's good to see the world from a human point of view.  
 I'm sorry about Thierry.  
 I can see that he was a great friend to you.  
 I was the one who made him.  
 Obviously I shouldn't have trusted him.  
 It doesn't make it any better.  
 You saved my life tonight and I owe you one.  
 You want your brother back.  
 It's the only thing I can do for you.  
 - Cammy.  
 - Don't even think about it.  
 I know why you're here.  
 You're here to say something nice for your friend.  
 You're a good man, but... . But...  
 But you've been hurt before and you don't want to try it again.  
 And so on and so forth  
 The man I saw tonight was not the man I thought he would be if he could get angry like that so easily . . .  
 Sounds like more than ordinary heartbreak  
 It seems someone has betrayed your trust  
 The courageous bartender, Camille.  
 I'm sorry.  
 But I hope you will give Marcel another chance.  
 I guess I was wrong about that.  
 No, you're right, but we both have our roles to play.  
 You went to see Marcel and danced with him.  
 You felt bad for him for arguing with his friends, but other than that, you just remembered that he was perfect.  
 Tonight was a complete failure  
 Cha-cha-cha, the opposite, sister  
 It was a great success tonight.  
 Are you crazy?  
 Katie died before Sophie could finish the spell.  
 I know exactly what I did. I killed Katie.  
 What have you done?  
 Our little witch who seeks death has no reason to  
 No attempt to bury Marcel with her.  
 I saved his life. That's why.  
 He did exactly what I wanted him to do.  
 Sophie trusts you.  
 I trust you, not my more trustworthy instincts.  
 Wake up, Rebecca.  
 The witches are only planning for themselves.  
 They only want Davina, the girl, and when they have her, what do you think the truce will be?  
 No, of course not.  
 They will use Davina's strength against all of us.  
 Even if you're right, the plan was to find Elijah, and you've let us down.  
 You always lacked faith in me.  
 By protecting Marcel, he trusted me more... so much so that he agreed to give us back Elijah when the time came.  
 When he has told me all about Davina  
 I will take control of her myself.  
 I have no doubt that you can do what you want, Nik.  
 You have always done so, regardless of the price paid by the rest of us.  
 You make me sick.  
 Are you all right? I'm worried.  
 Thank you.  
 I feel everything you have done  
 You've helped me.  
 It was the old boys, wasn't it?  
 In fact, Klaus was the one who saved me tonight.  
 I'm going to put things right, starting with the return of his brother.  
 No.  
 What's wrong?  
 - Davina!   
 - No.  
 You said the old gang was dangerous.  
 I won't give them back until I know how to kill them.  
 I thought you might like to know that  
 Elijah is coming back.  
 Congratulations!  
 I think there are good things in being evil.  
 You don't understand him, but you think of him.  
 Why is my brother always admired?  
 He was good to me  
 Sometimes I wonder if my family will ever be redeemed  
 I have learned something today  
 I feel like a girl  
 But whenever I want to give up, I see a glimmer of goodness that makes me believe in salvation.    
 You're following me  
 Perhaps you are in my way  
 I told you this band of sinful allies would bring no good  
 At least I've done something  
 And you?  
 Sabine told them that what you saw  
 It was the werewolf girl.  
 I think it was a girl.  
 No! 
 Wait! Wait!  
 What are you waiting for?  
 Tell me it's not a little Klaus
