 Are you looking forward to our honeymoon?  
 I'm looking forward to it.  
 That's right, if you're going to work, do it while there's no one around.  
 - We're here to say goodbye.   
 - Yes, have a great honeymoon!  
 - Thank you.   
 - I'd better go pack the luggage.  
 No, I've already packed.   
 I just can't find your swim trunks.  
 Your swim trunks? I don't have your swim trunks.  
 I'm going to go pack my unimpressive, extra-long swim trunks.  
 Good, you're still here.   
 I'm here to wish you a wonderful honeymoon.  
 Thank you. - Thank you.  
 I also want you to know that I'm going to tell the kids' dad today.  
 What's up?  
 - We know the boy's father is Rose.   
 - How do you know?  
 It's his sweater. 
 But oh my God!  
 I was so hoping that Rosie would be the first to know.   
 But you did, and I'm so relieved.  
 That's wonderful. I'm your child's aunt.  
 I know.  
 I'm an aunt.  
 I'm an uncle. 
 Come on.  
 - You will all be the child's aunt, uncle and aunt.   
- Yes, but only I am related to the child by blood.  
 Now that you know, you can help me with advice on what I should say to Rose.  
 What do you want to say?  
 I want to tell him that I want to keep the baby.  
 He can do whatever he wants.  
 That sounds very good.  
 Yeah, it's just, how do I start?  
 I mean, what should my opening line be?  
 - Okay, that was great. Thank you.   
- Good luck. - Yeah, see you later.  
 What was that all about?  
 I guess it doesn't matter if I tell you now.   
 Rachel's having Rose's baby.  
 What? I don't know anything about it.  
 Why didn't you tell me?  
 Why would I say something like that?  
 - I don't think you can keep a secret.   
 I am a master of confidentiality 
  I've always kept all our secrets.  
 - What secrets?  
 - No, Joey.  
 I'm not going to tell you because I'm a top secret.  
 - You're going to tell me later?  
 - You already know that.  
 It's so romantic to send someone else on a honeymoon.  
 Monica and Chandler are getting married.  
 Rosie and Rachel are going to have a baby.  
 - Maybe you and I should find something to do.  
 - You're right, my love.  
 Damn it, I left the guitar at their house. 
  Will you open the door for me later?  
 No, I don't have my keys. They took my keys and said to give them to you.  
 - What?
 They took mine and said they wanted to give it to you.  
 - Why did they take our keys?  
 Maybe they don't trust us.  
 They asked me to keep their keys the last time they went out of town.  
 That time you broke the ketchup bottle and took the towels that Monica gave the guests to clean up?  
 - Hey, I washed the towels.  
 - No, that doesn't sound like me.  
 - I need my guitar.   
 - I have something at his house, too.  
 - What's that?  
 - Monica's cheese chicken. I gotta get rid of it.  
 Mr. Trigger?  
 I have to go to Monica's and Chandler's.  
 It's an emergency. 
 There's a gas leak. 
 Bring the garlic bread.  
 - Did Rachel find you?  
 - No, what's wrong?  
 She's looking for you.  
 Well, I'll see her later.  
 - She really needs to talk to you right away.  
 - Yes, it seems to be important.  
 No, what?  
 I think I know what she's up to.  
 Really?  
 Yes, we promised not to tell anyone, but... . .   Rachel slept with me about a month ago.  
 And what happened?  
 I thought you'd be surprised.  
 I'm sorry. . . What about the result?  
 We said we would only do it once . . .  
 I think she might want to get back together with me  
 I don't think that's the case  
 - Why? What could it be, of course?  
 - I don't feel comfortable  
 I believe that's what happened.  
 No wonder she looked at me strangely at the wedding.  
 She didn't tell you anything?  
 - Maybe you ate the wrong thing.  
 - Please, go talk to Rachel.  
 - All right.  
 Do you know what I've learned?  
 Maybe I'm the kind of man who makes women forget all night long.  
 They will never be satisfied with me.  
 I should have remembered that.  
 The next one  
 - They're kissing. Let's go.  
 - Don't mind them, they love each other and I love you, but in an orderly way.  
 Next.  
 Hey, can you kiss while you walk? 
 I'm sorry we didn't hear you. 
  We're going on a honeymoon.  
 Let me take a look  
 There's still room in first class.  
 She upgraded them to first class because they were going on their honeymoon.  
 - We pretended we were going on a honeymoon too.  
 - We're really going on a honeymoon. 
  Touch my ass!  
 - Next in line.  
 - I'm sorry, I almost didn't hear you.  
 I love my new husband so much.  
 We're going on a honeymoon.  
 - Congratulations.  
 - Thank you. - Okay, Mr. Po, you're on 25J. - Mrs. Po is on 25K.  
 We're going on our honeymoon. Can you upgrade us to first class?  
 I'm sorry, first class is full. The couple just took the last two seats.  
 See? If you listen to me and plug them in, she'll give us first class seats, damn it!  
 Will J and K not be connected at the same time?  
 I still can't believe they took my keys and you gave me yours for safekeeping.  
 Then, of course, I will give it back to you. . ...  
 ...as soon as the person who cleans the key has wiped it clean.  
 - What's that sound?  
 Trigger, what are you doing?  
 - You said there was a gas leak.  
 - Why don't you use the key to open the door?  
 By the time I find the keys to their house, this apartment could have blown up.  
 If there is another explosion in my apartment, people will start to ask questions.  
 Can we do this? 
 You see them walking into the first class lounge.  
 - Do you know what's in there?   - I don't know.  
 I don't know. We have to get in there.  
 - Pretend you're a first class passenger.  
 - Oh, my God, there are oranges.  
 - It's nice to see you again.  
 - Would you mind showing me your ticket, sir?  
 No problem.  
 Move your thumb. I can't see the seat number.  
 It doesn't matter. I've got it on my back. It's 1A.  
 - It's not a first class ticket. I'm sorry.  
 - It's okay, I'm sorry.  
 I'm sorry. I'm afraid. I'm going to have to ask you to leave.  
 All right, run.   
 I think we really need to have a good talk.  
 That's right. Let's go inside.  
 - Listen, I know why you're here. 
  - Really?  
 Yeah, to make you look good. ... ...   I think maybe I should say it first.  
 Rosie and Rachel.  
 Rachel and Rose.  
 That's like a see-saw, right? 
 What?  
 I mean, we had a good time that night, and we had a good time.  
 But don't you think we'd be better off as friends?  
 You mean... . . what? What?  
 Okay, here's the deal.  
 We can do it again if you want.  
 I don't have a problem with that.  
 In fact, I'm free right now. ... You know what?   
 Do you know? Can I talk now?  
 - Of course I can   
 I'm pregnant  
 Roth  
 Rose.  
 Okay, I'll wait until you're ready.  
 By the way, you're the baby's father.  
 - Do you want some water? 
 - I'm fine.  
 Rose, don't feel any pressure, okay? 
  You can do whatever you want.  
 Yeah, I... I... I...  
 I just don't know... . .  
 I don't understand . . .   How could this happen?  
 - We have insurance covers  
 - I know.  
 But the condom is only 97% effective.  
 What?   They should be marked on the package  
 - It's on the package.  
 - No, they don't.  
 They should be marked on the package in big, bold letters  
 - Ross, leave the condoms alone.  
 - If I'd known, I wouldn't have bothered.  
 Listen, you know what?   I was shocked when I found out I was pregnant.
  - Scared? No, I wasn't.  
 I'm an angry consumer.  
 - Did you know that?
 We'll talk about it later.   
- No, I want to talk now.  
 In fact, I'd like to talk to the chairman of the insurance suite.  
 Maybe I should come back later. ... . All right.  
 All right, I'll press one.  
 - I've looked everywhere and there's no gas leak.  
 - Can I heat this one up?  
 Anyway, I'll help them put in a new door.  
 Can you not mention this to Chandler and Monica?  
 Because they don't have any children of their own. ... .  This door is like their child.  
 I have to put a new lock on it.  
 They're going to find out.  
 It looks like it's going to take all day.  
 I have to cancel my yoga class.  
 Tell Molly I can't make it to yoga class today.  
 No problem.  
 - Oh, my God, what's wrong with the door?  
 - Obviously?  
 - Is Rachel here? 
 - Didn't you two talk about it?  
 Yes, but... Yeah, but... . 
 Listen, you know that Rachel slept with me... . ...  But there's more to it than that.  
 Rachel's pregnant.  
 - My goodness!   
 - I don't believe  
 - She is pregnant with my child   
 - This is the first time I've heard of it.  
 - You already know this, don't you? 
 - A little.  
 - Are you okay?  
 - I'll be fine.  
   I didn't take care of it.  
 - What did you say to her? 
  - Nothing, but I told the customer service department of the insurance company a lot of things.  
 - I turned around and realized she was gone.  
  But I just found out that the condom only has a 97% contraceptive effect.  
 - What?   - I have to go find her.  
 Wait a minute. 
 Are you serious?  
 So there's a 3 percent chance they won't work?  
 They should have marked the package.  
 - Did they really do that?  
 - What?  
 - I can't believe we're here! 
  - What's the joke? 
 To celebrate your wedding, the restaurant is going to upgrade you to a honeymoon suite.  
 No, you've been ruining our whole day.  
 - Who are you?   - We are you.
 It was only 10 seconds late.  
 You've already taken the first class seats, the lounge.
 We deserve free hospitality too!  
 It's not just you on your honeymoon  
 We can give you our honeymoon suite  
 It doesn't matter where we sleep.  
 We came here to remember our love for each other  
 We don't need free hospitality. We just want to be together.  
 We need free hospitality  
 Monica, it's Joey. 
  Phoebe and I smell gas in your house.  
 - Is that true?
 Joey smells gas.  
 - What else is new?  
 - We'd like to take a look, but you've got our keys.   
- Do something to get in.  
 - I can break down your front door.  
 - Yeah, that's it.  
 - You won't blame us for breaking anything?  
 - No, we won't.  
 - Are you banging on the door?
 I didn't hear a sound.  
 - All right, I'm banging on the door.  
  He's banging on the door. He's breaking it down.  
 All right, we're in.  
 - Rachel, are you still comfortable?  
 - If I'm comfortable, will you judge me?  
 The doctor will be right over to give you an ultrasound.     
 God, I swear, if they sell this at the pottery store... ... ...  
 We need to talk.  
 Now? 
  I'm in a bit of a bad mood.  
 Bato, I really... I'm really... I really... I want to 
 I'd like to apologize to you for the way I just acted.  
 - It's okay. I'm sorry you had to stay at the bedside.  
 - What? I'm sorry. I'm crazy.
 All I can think about is myself. I should have thought of you. ... It's okay.  
 - It's okay, stay here at the head of the bed, Rose-Yeah.  
 I want you to know that I'll always be there for you, okay?  
 Come for your maternity checkup, take a LaMaze breathing class, decorate the apartment for Bobo.  
 But we can wait until after the wedding to worry about that.  
 - After the wedding? 
  - Yes, I think we should get married.  
 Is that your solution?  
 No, that's the right thing to do.  
 Maybe, as long as we love each other. 
 Rose, we don't love each other, do we?  
 Yes, but you can't do this alone.  
 What do you mean?  
 - You can't even eat alone in a restaurant.  
 - What?  
 If you can't eat alone, how can you take the children alone?  
 - I can eat alone. 
 - When have you ever done that?  
 When some of the people at the table have finished eating and I haven't finished yet  
 Some people take two hours just to have a bowl of soup.  
 Bato, you're a gobbler.  
 I grew up with Monica.  
 If you don't eat faster, you won't be able to eat.  
 Am I disturbing you?  
 No, Dr. Lange, please come in. 
 This is Rossi, the boy's father.  
 But I'm not her husband, because apparently she can raise the kids alone.  
 It's good to see you.
 I'm going to start the examination.  
 - Why can't you admit that you need me?  
 - I need you here at the head of the bed.  
 Okay, that looks normal.
 Here's what it looks like on the screen. This is your womb. ... This is your womb...  
 There's the baby.  
 Oh, my God.  
 There it is, I see it.  
 KUNG HEI  
 I'll leave you alone for a moment.   
 - Thank you.  
 Isn't it amazing?  
 I can't see it.  
 - What?  
 - I can't see it.  
 But you say you do.  
 I know. I lied. 
 I don't want her to think that I'm a terrible mother.  
 I can't even see my own baby.  
 Come here. 
 You can see it. 
 Come on. 
 It's right here.  
 It's so beautiful  
 I see it.  
 - Do you really? 
 - No, I don't see it.  
 Well, come on.  
 Do you see that little thing that looks like a peanut?  
 Sweetheart, that's the one.  
 That's the one?  
 I see it.  
 - Thank you.   
 - Don't be polite.  
 I don't believe that's our child.  
 Yes, that's our child.  
 - What did the doctor say?  
 - Everything is going well.  
 - Good.  
 - Let them see the pictures of your uterus.  
 I can't see my baby.   
  At first, I couldn't see it either. 
 But it was right there... . ...  
 Rose, I can't see it again.  
 I saw a man in your freezer.  
 Don't tell anyone.  
 You play cards with me as a bet?   
 Get out of here. 
 There will be no more kissing, no more weddings.  
 Have you ever tried to let your hair down?  
 Yes, I have.  
 It's beautiful.  
 Thank you, thank you.  
 Do you feel ashamed to go out with me?  
 Gabby would have been furious if she had found out.  
 Oh, my God, you're still in love with her.  
 In a few months, I'll be Mrs. Victoire Largo.  
 I didn't realize I was so capable. . .  
 Thank you, thank you.  
 - Did you tell Belle you were engaged?  
 - Yes.  
 She's hiking in Switzerland, but she did send me a basket of muffins.  
 - Joke's on you. 
 - No.  
 That thing traveled 5,000 miles and it's still fresh.  
 I don't know how she did it.  
 Hey, it's time.  
 Let's get some champagne.  
 Wait a minute. Wait a minute.  
 You're not going to embarrass me with a heartfelt toast, are you?  
 I won't, but Susan wrote a poem.  
 A poem?  
 She changed the words of the song into her poem.  
 Audition   
 One, two, three auditions.  
 What are you waiting for?
 Go and open the champagne!  
 Yes, please.  
 Thanks, thanks.  
 Hey, Gabby.  
 Hey Edie!   
 I finally got to meet Victoire.  
 He's a real charmer.  
 He's good, isn't he?  
 I know things are moving a little fast, but he's so great.  
 So you really love him?  
 Yes, I've never been so happy.  
 I'm so excited for you.  
 Edie, are you okay?  
 Yes, I'm--I'm fine. 
 Oh, my love.  
 Don't worry, you'll find the right person soon.  
 What do I know?  
 In fact, I've already found it.  
 I... I... . ... I'm crazy about him.  
 Who is it?  
 Oh, no, no, no.  
 Tonight is for you.  
 Oh, no, no, no, Edie. 
 Say it.  
 I'd be happy to know who makes you so happy.  
 - Really?  
 - Of course!  
 I want to know who makes you grin like that.  
 Well, in fact, it's Claus.  
 Who is it?
 Carlos.  
 I'm dating Carlos.  
 That's why Gabrielle Solis was hurt on the night of the engagement party.  
 Although she just laughed it off
 The truth is that Gabrielle was hurt much more deeply than anyone could see.  
 Gerard must have had another drinking problem last week. . ...    
 The mailman was at Sarah's house for over an hour.
 It was like he delivered more than a package.  
 I could smell the whiskey on Amy's breath.  
 It wasn't even noon yet.  
 John said she was taking a break for a religious retreat, but when did she start praying and get bigger breasts?  
 What kind of woman hides her husband's body in the freezer? 
 For 10 years?  That's crazy.  
 Did anyone talk to her?  
 I knocked on the door twice.  
 She ignored me.  
 Oh, I saw her curtains move. 
 I thought I saw her hands.  
 Oh, that's right. Now we know she's looking at us.  
 Why should we feel embarrassed?  
 It's not like we're hiding a frozen corpse in the basement.  
 You're right.  
 She even showed you the baby.  
 Oh, my God, I can't even imagine how many times she's taken ice cream out of that basement.  
 I mean, Jesus, if you're going to freeze your husband, at least get a freezer.  
 Do you think she killed her husband?  
 I think so.  
 If not, why did she hide the body?  
 Now she's only being charged with improper disposal of the body.  
 But once the body is thawed and the autopsy is done, I bet they'll find it full of arsenic.  
 What's arsenic?  
 It's just... it's just a little something evil, my dear.
 Go on and play with your ball. Go on. Go on.  
 I'm trying not to let the kids know about this.  
 Kids don't need to know about this.  
 Damn it, we all don't need to know.  
 Will you guys wait for me for a minute?  
 Hey Edie!  
 Oh, hey, Gabby!  
 What's up?  
 I've been thinking for a while, you know how I am... . .   How do you think about this?  
 Do you feel that sometimes people hate you?  
 I don't think you should feel that way because that's the way it is.  
 Since when?   From the time you started doing things that people hated.  
 What did I do?   Oh, I don't know.  
 The first thing I thought of was... . . Dating your friend's ex-husband.  
 Oh, so that smile on your face the other night was all fake.  
 You said you'd let me go out with Carlos.  
 Eddie, there are thousands of single men in the Scenic Area.  
 Why do you have to be with my ex-husband?   You're already engaged to someone else!  
 What do you care?   That's embarrassing!  
 That's--that's like when I donated the dress to the charity and then you showed up in it when I went to the party.  
 Again, what the hell do you care about something you've already given away?  
 Listen, Edie, you go find someone who's right for you and stop picking up other people's leftovers!  
 I don't think so?  
 Then you'll have to suffer.  
 Oh, Bato.  
 You're only as tall as my leg.  
 What else can you do? 
 You'll know soon enough.  
 Who is it this time?  
 Well... . . It's Ian.  
 Do you want to talk to him about something?  
 No. He brought flowers.  
 He's got flowers, too. I don't care. They look like two dozen roses.  
 Oh, no, I hope those thorns kill him.  
 Okay, Mom, I know Mikel and Ian did it wrong, but...  
 They used me as a poker bet.  
 They used a five-card hand to decide my fate.  
 "Wrong" doesn't even begin to express that level of badness.  
 Okay, okay, but they're the only two people in the world who know all your flaws and can find a way to love you.  
 Are you really going to do without both of them?  
 Yes, I do.  
 I don't need a man.
 I don't even need to make love.  
 Not for the first 16 years of my life. . .  
 And now, 22 years later, I'm still going on like this.  
 It must be very meaningful.  
 What?  
 Michael is here too.  
 Let's give up.  
 She ignored you for the first 10 times.  
 Now she won't.  
 It's so sad.  
 You really do have that British resilience.  
 Do you know that? 
 I'm going to have to give you a little face.  
 I like you better when you're unconscious and pooing in a bag!  
 Well, you're lucky I don't have that bag with me now.  
 All right, let's do it.  
 Excuse me?  
 Guys?  Hey, my mom really wants you two to get away from each other.  
 Don't be so soft-spoken.  
 Let them know I mean it.  
 Ah, because she would be very, very disappointed if you... if you didn't leave.  
 Yell at them!  
 Then you... . . go home. Go home. Think about what you've done.  
 If you want to be more aggressive, you do it yourself!  
 Here we go - duck ravioli with mushroom and cream sauce.  
 What do you think?   
 I think it's too bad you didn't make one for yourself.  
 Hey, sweetie.   
 Hey, I just wanted to say I love you.  
 How sweet of you?  
 What's that noise?  
 Are the kids still awake? 
 Yeah, they don't want to sleep.  
 Of course they don't.  
 They're kids, you're dad.  
 Let them go to sleep.  
 I tried to be affectionate, but they wanted to wait for you to come back.  
 They... ... They ... They miss their mom.  
 Are you trying to make me feel guilty for making me come home early?  
 Lynette's closed half an hour ago.  
 Please don't throw the pudding!  
 Oh, Tom. Oh... Oh... I'm so sorry.  
 I can't go back right now.  
 We're, um... . ...working on the inventory so... We're doing an inventory so... . . It's going to take a while.  
 Okay, then.  
 - Try to hurry up?   - I will.  
 I love you. See you again.  
 I love you.  
 I know I'm a bad person.  
 I just had to choose between motherhood and ravioli.  
 I have to--I have to go home.  
 Lynette, you have nothing to feel guilty about.  
 You work your butt off every day for the restaurant, and if anyone should take a break, it's you.  
 I'm being really sensible.  
 Give me some more.  
 That one too.  
 You're in here.  
 What are you doing out there?  
 There are children throwing eggs on Mrs. McCleskey's room.  
 Oh, my God.  
 They shouldn't have done that.  
 We should go and talk to her.  
 No, it's not.   
 It's too late.  
 She probably doesn't want us to bother her.  
 Come on, kids.  
 It's time to go to bed.  
 We have to do this--we're not talking to Edie anymore.  
 What do you mean, "we"?  
 I say "we" because she betrayed me, and you're my best friends, so you should support me.  
 "Support you" means. . . Like junior high school?  
 I can't believe you weren't furious about that one.  
 She was dating your ex-husband and Michael before she reached out to Carlos. 
 Yes, and you know who I blame?  
 I blame Carol and Michael.  
 How come no one is angry with them?  
 I mean, we had to deal with  
 Those men, they got away with it.  
 They're scum!  
 Okay, still talking about Edie. ... .   
 I'm not sure I would have joined forces against her.  
 Is that right?  
 I wasn't really comfortable being on your side when you and Patty Moore were arguing about the backyard fence, but I stood by you.  
 Gabby, it's not fair.  
 No one likes to reopen old scores.  
 Don't make me talk about the things I did for you, okay?   
 I'm still not going to Mrs. Kim's for the SPA because you didn't do a good job on that wax.  
 Oh my god!  
 How can hair removal be a problem?  
 Let her show you later.  
 But good friends don't just eat and talk together.  
 They also have a common enemy  
 Do you support me or not?  
 Of course we support you.  
 We will be very cold to Edie  
 No, no, no.  
 It's not cold, it's cold!  
 I want that bitch to be cold and shivering.  
 Good for you.  
 Good for you.  
 Do you still want me to see your book report?  
 Dad read it for me yesterday. 
 You weren't home yesterday.  
 Oh, okay.  
 Now daddy does everything  
 Why do you come home so late every day?  
 I'm really busy at the restaurant.  
 I'll come back to Dad as soon as I can. Trust me.  
 You're lying.  
 What?  
 You smile like that every time you tell a lie.  
 How can you say that?  
 It's the truth.  
 I came back late because I had too much to do and now I'm the only one who can do it. Now I'm going to buy something because I'm the only one who can go.  
 Go up there and do your homework.  
 Okay.  
 But that's your job.  
 I'm sorry.  
 Oh, hey, I'm sorry.  
 This is my parking space.  
 I parked here, so this spot is mine.  
 I waited for the guy to pick his teeth and make three phone calls to get this spot.  
 You can't just steal it like that!  
 It's just a parking space!  
 Don't secrete so many hormones! 
 Oh, my God!
 You did it on purpose!  
 Yes, that's what I was going to do.  
 You're crazy, bitch!  
 Do you know what you're doing?  
 What are you doing?  
 What are you doing?  
 I want my parking space back.  
 Get out! 
 Get out.  
 Hi. Hi.  
 Apologize to me.  
 Let me go!  
 Apologize!  
 Okay, okay, I apologize.  
 Say I'm a reckless, conceited bastard and I'll treat women with respect and kindness!  
 I'm a reckless, conceited... ... ...   What's next?  
 Don't move!  
 Is this guy trying to steal your car? 
 It's my car.  
 She tripped me up and took my keys.  
 Is that right, lady?  
 Okay, you listen to him!  
 Who are you spying on?  
 I called her twice and she didn't answer.  
 Maybe something's going on.  
 Maybe she's busy.  
 Yes, it became clear right away.  
 I'm calling her now.  
 Oh, my God. 
 What's wrong?  
 She pressed off the phone.  
 She pressed me off.  
 Maybe she's in trouble.  
 No, no, no. 
 It must have something to do with Gabrielle Solis.  
 She told everyone to leave me alone.  
 You're surprised?  
 I told you how she would have reacted if she knew about us.  
 What?  
 If she wants to play girlie tricks, let her play them.  
 Because I made it happen.  
 LYNETTE!  
 Hey!   Hey! Hey!  
 I just called you.  
 You did?  Must have put the phone on hold.  
 Oh, it's okay.  
 You're invited to bring the kids to Travell's birthday party on Saturday.  
 I'll have the amphibian guy bring all the snakes and lizards.  
 Oh, the kids will love it, but I've got work to do.  
 Oh, what a coincidence. I thought you were going to provide food for us.  
 Food?  
 I'll have pasta and salad for the parents and at least 20 pizzas for the kids.  
 That much?  
 Yes, you know the children.  
 If one child has a pizza party, it's good for all the other children.  
 That's a good thing for business.  
 Well, I could use a little help.  
 Oh, I know you'll help me.  
 I know you'll help me. . ... I love you.  
 Regardless of what the court report says  
 I don't have a problem with anger.  
 I just had a bad day.  
 You threatened to cut off someone's head because of a parking space?  
 A very bad day.  
 Susan, there's usually a reason for losing control like you did.  
 Is it going well at work?  
 Work is going well. 
 Why don't you just sign the paperwork and tell the judge I'm okay?  
 What about home?  
 Home is fine.  
 Really, you're wasting your time here.  
 What about your love life?  
 Cancel my lunch.  
 I have to stay here for a while.  
 Damn it, you can't hold it down. ... ...  
 I'm sorry, Patrick.  
 I thought it was those little brats who rang the doorbell and ran.  
 What do you want to say?  
 I want you to come back and take care of us.  
 The new babysitter is awful!  
 You hired a new babysitter?  
 Yeah, and she's giving us carrots as a snack.  
 That's not good, but... But... But... Sometimes life is like that.  
 It doesn't have to be.  
 All you have to do is tell everyone what happened to your husband and everything will go back to the way it was.  
 Have you seen the women?  
 No matter what I say, I can't get away from their long conversations.  
 I'm sorry for the kids, but... But... But... 
 I had to wait for this.  
 Can you imagine? !  
 See how humiliating it is to find out that two people you trust are playing poker with you as a bet?  
 How humiliating would that be? !  
 It depends on your point of view.  
 Men have been fighting over women for many centuries.  
 I admit that the fight is not as rambunctious as the spear fight, but it does show how they feel about you.  
 The question is how do you feel about them?  
 I've said it before. . I said... Hurt, betrayed  
 How did you feel about them before the question of Punch?  
 I am engaged to Ian. . . so . So... ...so... ...so... It is clear that I love him  
 What about Michael?  
 Do you love him too?  
 - Is it almost time?  
 - Susan, yes, yes, I loved him.  
 I still love him. I love Ian too.  
 So that means I am desperately in love with two men.  
 Finally, I've found the focus of the problem.  
 That's good.  
 No!   It's bad!  
 It shouldn't have happened in the first place!  
 I only let myself fall in love with Ian because I thought I'd lost my Milkman.  
 And then all of a sudden he wanted to get back together with me, and now I have a hard time deciding.  
 I agree, it's hard. 
 It's hard to break down!  
 If I choose Michael, then Ian will be heartbroken, but Ian doesn't deserve this.  
 But how can I reject Michael after all he's been through? 
 So you just leave them both?  
 You have to make a choice, sweetheart.  
 You have two good men, both of whom are crazy about you.  
 Give up one . . ... That's a life well lived  
 Both of them give up . . ... That's really... . .  
 Silly enough? 
 Yes, objectively speaking, that's what it is.  
 Sounds great. Thanks.  
 Hey, do you want to eat something other than spaghetti and pizza?  
 Is there such a thing?  
 Don't be ridiculous.  
 No, it's not mine. It's not mine. My friend Al is opening a southern style restaurant. . . 
 He wanted to have some of his buddies preview the menu on Sunday night.  
 He said I could bring someone.  
 And then... . . And then... . ... And then you want me to go with you?  
 That will be after we close the door.  
 Don't tell me you don't like Southern food, then we won't be friends.  
 No, I like it.  
 It's just that... . It's just... It's just that it's a little late for me and then... ... . 
 Oh, oh, oh, okay.  
 I just thought it would be fun.  
 Yeah, it'll be fun. It's just that it's a little hard on Sunday night.  
 I have to make lunch and check my homework. . ...  
 Yeah, yeah, yeah.  
 Don't worry.  
 I know.  
 You're, uh, you're the first person I think of.  
 You know what? Maybe I should go.  
 Uh... . .   It's part of the job to check the competition, isn't it?  
 Yes, of course.   
 You can't go wrong.  
 I agree.  
 Hey, kids, let's go check out the snakes.  
 I'll give you some pizza later, okay?  
 - I'll see you later.  
 - Hey, you want a quick pizza?   - Yeah.  
 Here you go, Lynette!  
 What are you doing here?  
 Edie, let me take care of the food.  
 I know I'm a bitch, but please don't tell Gabby.  
 Hey Susan!  
 I bought 30 copies of your book. 
 The kids can't wait for you to sign them.  
 Come on, let's go!   Come on, come on, come on!  
 Look, we're on the same boat.  
 Yes, only I didn't know Edie was going to have a party in the park.  
 What if Gabby sees us?   
 I'm sure I don't have to worry.   
 I talked to her this morning, and she's going away for a whole day with Victoire.  
 Well, then, don't worry.  
 Let's go.  
 Don't you dare.  
 Hey!   What are you doing?  
 "Witch."  
 - Hey, don't fuck around!   - Why not?  
 - Because she's not a witch - how do you know?  
 How do you know? - No, no, no. Don't be a jerk.  
 Who is she, your girlfriend?   She's your girlfriend?  
 Shut up!  
 Hey, little devils!   Stop it!  
 Sorry, Patrick.  
 Are you okay?  
 If you had told everyone what you told me, nothing would have happened.  
 You can stop them.  
 Hey, Lynette, I'm Gabby.  
 I was dragged to a photo shoot, and there was no place to rest.  
 So I'm free for lunch. 
 Would you like to join us?  
 I contacted Susan, but she's not at home. It's strange. Her car is still in the driveway. So are you.  
 Where's everybody going?  
 Get down!   Get down!   Get down!  
 Get down!  
 What's wrong with you, Lynyrd Sky?  
 Gabi is coming. 
 What? !  Didn't you say she was with Victoire?   I was wrong. 
 I was wrong. Come on, follow me. Follow me.  
 Mommy, can I play with you?  No! 
 Go ride your python!  
 Come on.  
 "Rent a reptile."  
 Okay, okay, she's circling the park.  
 Oh, I wish she'd hurry up. I'm afraid of snakes.  
 Oh, yeah, but I'm more afraid of Gabby.  
 All right, all right.  
 We're almost safe. . ...  
 What's up?  
 Don't look back.  
 L y n e t t e !
 S u s a n !  
 Hey, Gabe.    
 Hey, what are you two doing here?  
 Well, what are we doing here?  
 Oh, Edie asked me to provide food. It's really just for business.  
 I don't know why she's here too.  
 You're dead. I can't believe it.  
 This is a complete betrayal of our friendship.  
 Gabby asked me to make 20 pizzas and bring them to her door, and I couldn't say no.  
 Oh, this is going to be fun!  
 Is our friendship worth 20 pizzas to you?  
 - We had a deal!  
 - Oh, come on, Gabby, be sensible.  
 You're embarrassing us by doing this.  
 - Me?   You both need to apologize to me.   
 - Don't be reasonable.  
 I'll leave this party right away. If you don't come with me right now.  
 - That's the end of our friendship. 
 - Gabby!  
 Come on - what? What? !   - ! No!  
 I mean it!  
 Claus, stop!  
 Let me go!   What are you doing!  
 Let go of me!
   Carol, let me go!  
 How dare you hold me like that!  
 You are ruining the birthday party of Tara Vels!  
 What the hell are you doing?  
 I don't like it. Their betrayal is driving me crazy.  
 Come on, Gabi, you have no right to interfere with who Susan and Lynette are friends with.  
 I'm here to tell you what's ridiculous is that you don't have the face to tell me that you and Edie are dating! 
 That's ridiculous.  
 Oh, no.  
 Yes, I didn't even know about it until the engagement party.  
 And I didn't even see the news of your engagement to that guy Victor on the TV.  
 I didn't intend to do that.  
 It was just a momentary impulse.  
 So what did you just say about the flight?  
 - You're in love with that guy?  
 - Yeah, I'm in love.  
 That's great.  
 Are you not in love with Edie?  
 We're happy together, but we'll never be serious.  
 That's why... So... . If I'm dating and you're in love with someone else and getting married . ... ...  
 Please remind me why you are the one who has to be such a nuisance?  
 I'm sorry, Carol, you should be.  
 - Hey! Hey!   - Hey! Hey!  
 How many quiches do you want to bring home?  
 Whatever you want. I don't want to be seduced.  
 I want to bring some for Tom. . ...  
 Hi, Mrs. McCleskey.  
 Would you like some custard too?  
 I didn't come for dessert.  
 I know you're all talking about me, and I think the only way to get you to shut up is for me to clarify.  
 The... . . Who wants to hear some of the horrible details?  
 - I do.   
 - Um... . .   Well, if you want to talk... ... . okay.  
 Well, first of all-- some of you will find this upsetting, but I didn't kill Gilbert.  
 I came home from a weekend at Lock Haven to find him dead in front of the TV.  
 The remote control was still in his hand, for God's sake!  
 It was 2:00 in the morning, so I decided to wait until morning to call the funeral home.  
 I went to the table to check on the situation  
 Then I found his pension plan and guess what?  
 He died and I wasn't a beneficiary.  
 - Then who was it?   - His first wife.  
 He married that woman right after he started working. . ... It's only been two years.  
 We lived together for 34 years and that idiot didn't even bother to change the paperwork.  
 Not only did I lose Gilbert, I had to lose everything.  
 So I... . .   So I... . ...  
 You hid him in the freezer and kept cashing the checks.  
 Oh, what else could I have done?  
 And the feeling that he's still with me after a while isn't bad either.  
 Let's not talk about that. ... I'm not saying that...   The opposite is the truth.  
 The women can spread the news everywhere. ... . .   But some people won't need it.  
 Didn't expect me to come, huh?  
 Oh, I've called 20 times and you haven't answered. . Yeah.   Yeah, I can't believe it.  
 Speaking of which... ... ...   It's obvious... ... ...   I have been very disturbed  
 I finally went to see a psychiatrist.  
 In fact, that's what the court ordered me to do, so let's not talk about that. . .  
 ...um... . ...   I'd like to talk to you.  
 You're sure?  
 Yes.  
 I'm going to marry Ian.  
 I'm sure I had a hard time making that decision, especially since you remembered what we used to do.  
 - Perhaps it's because the world has changed - no.  
 I'm sorry, Michael.  
 At least I still have the memories.  
 - Are you ready to go?  
 - Yes.  
 I told Kim that she was ready to lock up for the rest of the day.  
 - That's great.  
 I... I... . I... . .   Go get your clothes.  
 - Okay.  
 Hi!   Do you have a table for seven?  
 - Hi! Hi!    - Hey! Hey!   
 What are you guys doing here?  
 The kids want to surprise you. We eat together as a family. That's how it always is. . .   How did you get here?  
 I said you can't drive.  
 I took a taxi. I took two doses of painkillers. How could I not?  
 - Surprised?  
 - Yes, a little.  
 We all miss you so much.  
 Oh, I miss you too.  
 Hey, go grab a big table and I'll have Rick make us some snacks.  
 Hey, wow. Oh, you smell good.  
 Oh, it must be mint. 
 Smells good.  
 Hey, Kayla, you go get a high stool for your sister, okay?  
 - Who wants a pizza?  
 Oh, hey, change of plans.  
 Yeah, I can see that.  
 Not a good idea.  
 But you go on. ... ...  
 Oh, no, I'll stay.   
 I'll make you a nice meal for the whole family.  
 Thank you, thank you.  
 Thank you, sweet girl.  
 You're really taking care of me.  
 When is Lynette coming home?  
 She'll be back as soon as the pizzeria closes.  
 Is that guy Rick helping her?  
 It's best if we pay him a salary.  
 I think Lynette likes him.  
 Of course. 
 He's a nice guy and he works well.  
 No, I mean she likes "him", she likes "him".  
 How can you say that?  
 It's just my opinion.  
 Okay, good night, Dad.  
 Susan, haven't you heard of her? Oh, my God, I love to call you that.  
 Do you want to keep your name?  
 Because I love that name so much. 
 Just let me call you "my wife". 
 I'm in a relationship.  
 Don't you think we'll live in a honey pot?  
 I mean, it could be so sweet that we'd get tired of it. 
 People will be throwing fruit then.  
 Oh, I have to pack this up.  
 Why don't you go upstairs and warm up the bed first?  
 You really know we're going to be together for life, don't you?  
 I do.  
 Hi Susan, I don't want to disturb you.  
 It's just that there's so much I haven't said.  
 I... I... I...   I can't say the words "see you again in the morning".  
 No matter what, you are the most beautiful scenery in my life, and I hope you will have a happy home.  
 See you again 
 Oh, I'm Michael. 
 Hi, Susan.  
 Hi Susan. . .   I don't want to interrupt you.  
 It's just that there's so much I haven't said.  
 Oh... .   I can't say the word "see you again  
 No matter what, you are the most beautiful scenery in my life  
 I hope you will have a happy home  
 See you again  
 Oh, it's Michael.  
 Where are you going?  
 Home. . ...   Back to England.  
 Back to England? 
 What's wrong?  
 Oh, it's just... . .  
 I'm not going to work or anything?  
 Ten minutes ago, we were just thinking about the future, and you were saying how happy we were to be with each other.  
 I... . I ...   I saw you listen to Michael's message.  
 Oh, Ian, I made a choice.  
 But not for the right reasons  
 You're just trying to honor the promise you made to me.  
 It's not like that.  
 I'll forget, Mikey.  
 You must forget him as soon as I know you.  
 It hasn't been going well, has it?  
 I love you.  
 I know you love me.  
 But you love him a little more, don't you?  
 I don't want to feel so far away every time I look at my wife.  
 I think you're thinking about him.  
 I'm so sorry.  
 You deserve to be happy.  
 I am also  
 See you again, Susan  
 Hi, Mrs. McCleskey.  
 Well, our new nanny is not doing a very good job.  
 Do you want to start the journey of responsibility again?  
 Are you sure you want me, the Witch of Wisteria Lane, to look after your children?  
 My children know that you are not a witch. 
 It's bad.  
 I should have taken a staff.  
 We miss you. 
 So do I.  
 But I need a raise.  
 I'm penniless, okay?  
 I just spoke to Mrs. McCluskey, and she's coming to help us with the kids again.  
 - That's great.  
 Yeah. And I've been thinking. I've been thinking... .   It's time for me to go back to work.  
 - What? 
 - Yes, I'm done.  
 I should go for a walk. 
 But... . But...   The doctor said it would take months for you to recover, and now it's only been six weeks.  
 I don't want to... . .   I can squirt cheese on a pizza. 
 And... . .   I don't want you to have to support the restaurant by yourself.  
 - I don't mind - do I? 
  Because you said it was better than dying.  
 Yeah, I said that, but I don't want you to go back to work before you've recovered.  
 You'll get hurt again.  
 I'll be careful.  
 The best thing is that I can get rid of Rick.  
 Rick?   Why did you fire him?  
 I know he's nice, but... . .   Yeah... ...but... .   His salary affects our earnings.  
 In fact, he brings in more than his salary.  
 I mean, he's got a fan base because of all the new dishes he's making.  
 Really?  Yeah.   
 I think firing him was a big mistake.  
 Oh, I was just thinking about it.  
 Well, don't think about it too much.  
 Take a break and get better.  
 That's what we need to do.  
 You're coming home late?  
 Most likely.   
 We're having a big party at 10:00.  
 So... So... So... 
 I'll only see you in the morning.  
 - I'm waiting for you.   
 - I'll wait for you.  
 Hi, I d a 
 What's up?  
 That idiot postman has mixed up our letters again.  
 Oh, poor Mr. Henry, his memory is getting worse and worse.  
 Thanks for stopping by.  
 Hey, did you hear about Michael?  
 No. What happened to him?  
 - He moved.   
 - Moved?  
 What does that mean?  
 Monica Clare had a sour stomach and couldn't sleep at 2:00 a.m. She saw that Michael had packed everything.  
 Then it doesn't make sense.  
 Michael wouldn't have left without even saying hello.   
 He did.  
 According to Claus, something bad happened and Mikey had to go and hide for a while.  
 It's a shame.  
 I've always liked him.  
 I wanted to be an assistant manager, but obviously... . .   I had to flirt with Mrs. Sccavo to get the job.  
 He still goes out with Edie, but everyone can see that he still loves Gabby.  
 Are you the old lady who is said to be hiding her husband in the fridge?  
 Yes, that's me.   
 Scary, isn't it?  
 Welcome to the Williamsburg restaurant. My name is Max because the hospital won't let my mother give my name as "Oops."  
 I'm going out of town for the summer. What's new?  
 What's new?   I think. . ...  
 Facebook is publicly listed and Snowden is in the snow  
 Kim and Karen had a baby, so there's another Kardashian who doesn't need to be watched (keeepup).  
 Pawlana Dene is out of work. Same-sex marriage law passed by gourmet advocates, repeatedly in trouble for racially discriminatory comments.  
 Jus tin bile r hit-and-run C h r i s b r o w n also hit-and-run    
 Rina was beaten up and still didn't run away (the two were reunited after a domestic abuse by Charles Brown)  
 Oprah gave Lindsay $200,000 to get her on the show, Michael Douglas, to give oral sex to women and get throat cancer... so the world has another excuse for men not to give blow jobs to women.  
 The situation in Egypt is in turmoil, and the child actor Bynes has made it worse with her recent crazy antics, with the NSA censoring everyone's phone calls like a crazy ex-girlfriend.  
 There's the Texas nasty lady (via the anti-abortion law case), the Florida nasty black man who beat and killed the black boy, Terry Van Mathien, who was acquitted of all charges.  
 And everyone is sick of everything except Angelina Jolie.  
 I mean, is there anything new on the menu?  
 I don't know. Let me ask.  
 Hey Carol, is there anything new I need to know?  
 The royal treasure smiled at the queen.  
 I mean about our store.  
 Oh, looks like we're cleaning the forks now?   Let me ask.  
 Look, Max, in one quick change, we've gone from wearing polyester and being pathetic to being proud and powerful.  
 Just like Superman.  
 But Superman changes at a phone booth, not a small store with a "Happy Hour Call to Max" sign.  
 If you are not satisfied, why do you still write?  
 Because I don't have enough eyeliner to write "Fun Times for Charlie".  
 Look, we're wearing our "McMuffin" T-shirts again.  
 See the logo?  
 In fact, I try not to look at the area of your girls' breasts.  
 Let me be frank.  
 Oh, Elle, you are one in a million.  
 Because 999,999 men would only look at my area.  
 I have to go home.  
 I miss growing up in Korea so much.  
 What do you miss?   Youth?  
 In my country, I'm the middle child.  
 In my head, I'm still rich, and my health insurance isn't the same as the Modern Progenitor vitamin chewables.  
 Who wants to go back and see how great our new custard store is?  
 Calm down, Rachael Roy (the star of a cooking show with a lot of brainwashed fans)  
 We shouldn't get too excited about the opening tonight  
 The last time it was big, business was not so good.  
 It's like saying that people near a nuclear meltdown are not doing so well.  
 Ha!
 Girls, I'm so proud of you two... for getting back up from where you fell.  
 After my first Jazz album failed to sell  
 I turned my life to drinking, drugging and bimbos  
 It's funny how things work out.  
 But why is your egg-cake store open at this time of day?  
 - It's now 2am - we're open from 2am to 4am  
 Our target group is the "post-bar" crowd  
 The drunken Williamsburgers  
 The same target group that I had when I was single is now the target group for my new store.  
 It's funny how things work out.  
 We weren't expecting much from the opening tonight.  
 It's a soft opening (trial business)  
 What's the difference between soft and hard?  
 Do you want me to show him?  
 Thank you, no need.  
 Seriously, it won't take a minute.  
 No need, Olég  
 Just to let you know, I'm in the mood.  
 I'm ready for this room to be transformed.  
 - And again?   - Whatever you want to call it.  
 Close your eyes before we go in.  
 I want you to have a complete experience.  
 Yeah, and I want to trip you.    
 - She's joking.  
 No, she didn't. - No, I didn't.  
 I promise I won't let her trip you.  
 Close your eyes now.  
 - What's wrong?   - Now I feel like  
 She's going to hit me.  
 - She didn't... no, I did.  
 No, I did. Okay, enough with the closing eyes.  
 Just show me the smelly room in the back.  
 Let me turn off the lights for a little extra drama.  
 What's wrong?   I didn't do anything.  
 It's me.  
 Now he knows what's hard.  
 I can't believe my own eyes.  
 I felt the same way the first time I saw you.  
 The bottles and jars are the originals, the tiles are the originals, and the tools are the originals.  
 What do you think, Olég?  
 It's good.  
 "Good"?   You just say "fine? "  
 This place used to be a rat adventure park!  
 They were waiting in line to bite us.  
 Charlie, show them the wound.  
 - I don't want to - good?  
 This house used to smell like a suicide scene of poo.  
 Or a cesspool of death.  
 Look at what we have done!   We've created the  
 We've created the best, coolest cupcake store ever, and I love it!  
 But you know, don't get too crazy, it's just a trial run.  
 And ahhh, all of this is possible thanks to you letting us rent this place for free.  
 Free rent?   Let's remember...  
 When did I ever say "free rent"?  
 At 4:00 p.m. on the 27th, you said.  
 "I don't care about that dump, you can take it for free".  
 "I don't care if it burns to the ground."  
 I knew learning English would come back to bite me sooner or later.  
 Someone's already knocking on the door?   It's a good sign, Max.  
 It's open for business!  
 Look, girls, I'm blowing the trumpet for you!  
 Thanks, Sophias, but we don't want to be too high profile, it's just a pilot business.  
 Oh, I love trial businesses.  
 - Good for you, Sophias - Oh, good for you, Olég  
 Sorry for the awkward meeting.  
 If we had known you would come and surprise us  
 - We wouldn't have invited Olga - yes  
 I was there when you two broke up, and now I'm still stuck with PTSD.   
 "Post-traumatic surreal drama"  
 There's no such thing as blood.  
 The award for the best drama series will go to  
 Aren't we right, Olga?  
 Yeah, we're friends now.  
 I cheated on you, so she broke my car window.  
 And the window of my apartment.  
 And your stereo and flat screen TV.  
 And my brother's flat-screen TV and his daughter's computer.  
 Yes, she scared me. She wasn't supposed to be home at that time.  
 We're back to being friends for the evening.  
 Goodnight Friends  
 And Olég  
 That's a good one.  
 Look, my dear, there's a guest.  
 Hey, cool guys!  
 Come and have some food at the restaurant where the nun is trying out her business!   (also means soft private parts. . . )  
 It's not what I expected, but I'll take it.  
 Hello, you guys.  
 What's in it?  
 Welcome to the McX handmade cupcakes!  
 In England, we call them "fairy quiches".  
 A fairy quiche?   Damn it!  
 Why are all the handsome guys gay?   (faliy means gay man)  
 Give us all this plate.  
 Oh my god!  
 American Express Black Card?   (The best card in the world is said to be able to buy airplanes)  
 I haven't had a black one in years.  
 I'm guessing you've never held a black one.  
 Sorry, today is our first day of business, cash only.  
 This guy is a real mess  
 - What's the addiction?   - I was almost there for a while.  
 I don't know what I was doing, but I was jealous.  
 Now I'm really jealous.  
 I'm sure he'll be fine.  
 Oh, I bet he's not only gonna be fine.  
 He'll be my next boyfriend.  
 Ronald, come on, man.  
 He's not breathing.  
 I can't wake him up. Call 91!  
 Call 911!  
 Everybody calm down. I've seen it happen a lot.  
 One summer I was working part-time for a drug den. He'll be up soon. He's dead.  
 Wrong.  
 Michael died in front of our store last night, and the guy was a rocking star.  
 He also had a relationship with Katemos.  
 No offense, but isn't it the same as the law in England to have an affair with a kastmoss?  
 All men must do it as soon as they reach the age of 21.  
 His name is Roland Glass and he has released two gold albums.  
 I can't believe I've never heard of him.  
 I believe  
 You still listen to "The Legend of the Paperboy" soundtrack  
 Yesterday, he was a rocking star, and now he's gone.  
 Things change, so I ordered breakfast from that awesome breakfast place on the corner.  
 You ordered breakfast from "The Best Latte"?   I walked by that place every day and only two things went through my mind.  
 First, I want to have a gun (cum: a sperm shooter)  
 Secondly, one day, my mother would order breakfast delivery and the best croissants would be included.  
 Who knows, maybe I'll smoke too much tonight and die unexpectedly.  
 But at least I'll die doing what my mom loves most.  
 You're right, Max. You only live once.  
   
 The next time you say "YOLO", you won't have a chance to live.  
 No, it's bad news again!  
 The Google newsletter for the handmade cupcakes says you have a Google newsletter for our business?  
 I only set up a Google newsletter for "Oprah Naked".  
 Not that it will happen, but if it does, I'll be the first to know.  
 It's been said on the Internet that Roland Glass died in front of our store.  
 Well, my phone died too. It's really contagious.  
 Oleg, why are you still carrying our store's light sign?  
 Didn't you say it's already up?   I mean, I'm a big bird.  
 I can't put it up now either. There are people in front of your window.  
 Are there people in front of our windows?  
 Brother, is this the place where my house is hung up?  
 Yes, it's right there. I'll put the candles here, next to Paddington Bear.  
 I found it at his last concert.  
 And picked up this herpes.  
 How come he just laid down and died?  
 He didn't die until he touched this smile first.  
 Laughing?   Sister!  
 Max, come and talk to me.  
 I'm sorry. Oh, your hat is so pretty.  
 Thank you, I found it in the garbage.  
 Michael, what are you doing?  
 Don't say he hit it there.  
 Let's get this out of the way.  
 If we don't, we won't be able to do anything.  
 Three dozen egg cakes for you, girl.  
 We have to do it.  
 A group of brothers are coming to keep watch tonight. How much is an egg cake?   7 yuan.  
 Why is it so expensive?  
 This way, I can rest in peace.  
 * Knock, knock, knock on the door of heaven  
 Before he fell down, he hit it here.  
 He looked at me while falling and smiled.  
 He was happy and peaceful  
 Seven dollars a piece, cash only.  
 I said, "Can you break the 50?  
 Max.  
 Why did you call me?  
 Break a 50.  
 Okay, why? Why? Why?  
 * Knock, knock, knock on the door of heaven  
 10 bucks, 10 bucks, 10 bucks, 10 bucks.  
 It's almost sold out.  
 I have to get some more from the kitchen.  
 Okay, I'm coming.  
 Ealal?  
 Here we go.  
 I'll give you 30 cents for every dollar you sell.  
 What a shame!  
 Do you know how much we can make if we sell marijuana?  
 Do you want to be a partner too?   The old division.  
 Damn, you smell like a hippie, not like a shithole.  
 People are mourning. Show some respect.  
 I'm putting respect?   Respect for what?  
 What are you two going to do next?   Sell egg cakes to diabetic children in children's hospitals?  
 Do you doubt my sincerity?  
 I just kicked a homeless man off the mourning altar and he pissed on it twice.  
 I don't care if I said those words at 4:00 p.m. on the 27th.  
 Your business is booming and I want to collect the rent.  
 You're dreaming... he overdosed and died... what's wrong with that?  
 God was kind to us and let him die in front of my window  
 Life is short. I accept it.  
 Y O L O  
 It's not "YOLO", it's "HDO", but I'm sorry he's going to die for once.  
 Why don't you just sell T-shirts with "HODO" on them?  
 Don't you stop?  
 We are soothing the wounded soul with egg cakes  
 And to tell you that we are selling with respect, knock, knock, knock, knock on the door of the apple store.  
 I've had enough of making money from my business  
 must pay me the rent for 200  
 A year?  
 A month... is there such a cheap place in such a nice place?  
 We cleaned it too.  
 Just to show him the rat's tooth marks!  
 People don't want to  
 I don't care what you say, I've decided!  
 - Show him the teeth marks!   - That's it!  
 You've been bitten by a rat on your ass?  
 All right, give me 195.  
 You said no rent. You said it.  
 It's business, no personal feelings.  
 Can you understand my pain?  
 Show him the teeth marks on the front!  
 No, no, no, it's too personal.  
 - Sorry for your sacrifice - it's hard.  
 - It's not a bad recovery - don't comfort me  
 We also put some flowers there as a token of appreciation  
 Feels so warm  
 As if you did not steal the flowers  
 It's all about the love.  
 And isn't it more economical to put flowers in other people's gardens?  
 What about the memorial altar?  
 Don't deceive me!  
 I don't care what you say.  
 * Knock, knock, knock on the door of heaven!  
 Can you believe it?  
 He is rich in death.  
 Why don't you ask us to join you?  
 Tonight, we're proud to present Roulad's Chicken in Los Angeles.  
 We're offering a special price of $8.95 for our condolences.  
 The dark side of the little cricket is about to be revealed.  
 No way, Max, this is our memorial altar.  
 Get the bears out of here.  
 And bring back the altars of the dead?  
 Wait, I'll pay tribute to my pride.  
 He just died here.  
 Michael, are you going to succeed or not?  
 If so, take these poems away without any rhyme and move them back to our window.  
 Because they are our dead money  
 Are you being a little unkind?  
 "In heaven, keep on shaking the bull Kevian love you"  
 Rhyming golden lines ah  
 I knocked over a wax candle, I caught a small fire  
 It's burning on my shoes  
 If we don't put out the fire, it'll be my memorial service.  
 Look!   Look!  
 How dare these two girls destroy the memorial altar of the dead!  
 Look!   A cockroach has escaped from the dining room!   Trample it to death!  
 Look, you hippies, put down your smoking guns and look!  
 They're disturbing the peace of the dead for their own financial gain!  
 Hey, that's not nice.  
 That's right, that's right!  
 - It's him who's bad!     - Yes!   Look at him!  
 Look at him! Roland Gross died a tragic death in front of our rotten custard store window.  
 See? "Tragic," "tragic"?  
 That rhyme just popped out.  
 Hey! Hey!  
 Hey, he knows!  
 I told him not to pee on the memorial altar in front of our window yesterday!  
 Isn't that right?  
 Yes, that's the shrew.  
 That's right!   That's right!   I'm the bitch!  
 Man, that's not good.   
 Throw him out!  
 That's my wallet!  
 Stop it!   It's not my wallet!  
 Stop! Stop!  
 Stop!  
 "Stop it!   (The 2012 Tony movie is a self-imagining)  
 Put him down. He's not a bad guy.  
 Even dressed like this with this brain.  
 Seriously, do you really have to go to such lengths to be successful?  
 Just let him be torn to pieces?  
 I'm thinking about  
 I'm thinking.  
 Max, I'm thinking about it.  
 Well, no one is knocking on our windows anymore.  
 There are more people lying dead outside and at the door.  
 I thought again about what we did today  
 How did we let Hahn live?  
 Are you here?  
 I brought you some Starburst pudding as a token of my appreciation.  
 What's in a Starburst pudding?   Pills?  
 Broken dreams?   Tear-soaked underwear?  
 Carolinas?  
 I'm not as easy to talk to as Max.  
 That's what the girls in my class in seventh grade said (easey: easy to blister)  
 See, I was wrong.  
 No, I was wrong.  
 We should have paid the rent.  
 I'm not talking about the rent.  
 Rent?   Who said anything about rent?  
 I shouldn't have said it's not a private matter, it's a business.  
 Stop those stinking hippies!  
 After they cut me to pieces.  
 I realized that what we do is more personal.  
 Of course, there was a bit of business too (a little bit of business)  
 A little JJ, huh?   (A little bit of business.)  
 But what else do you have?  
 Max, don't be so mean to Hanan.  
 He doesn't charge us rent.  
 Who said no rent?  
 I've come up with a price that I think is right.  
 - $250,000 - yeah, that sounds about right.  
 I remember when you first opened the quiche, right?  
 Then we'll talk about the rent when you get to that number.  
 How kind of you!  
 I hate to break it to you, but I hate to tell you that she just said, "Hard-boiled Han."  
 Really, Helen, you are so generous.  
 But we're a little upset about that... but we're including you in this business?  
 I'll just wait for the rent. You're my good friends.  
 Finally, a woman was willing to give her body to him, and he turned it down.  
 Google News  
 Opara h has gone braless?  
 Max, don't even think about it. It can't happen.  
 Not with your attitude, of course.  
 Oh my God, the autopsy revealed that Rowland Glass choked to death on a piece of one of Michael's homemade cupcakes.  
 That's too bad.  
 Hey, where's your excitement, Rachael Roy?  
 This place is going to be awesome!  
 It won't be long before the cynical hipsters are lined up in front of the window shouting, "Have a piece of that guy's cupcake and kill him!"  
 Open the window!   Let's go back to business!  
 But we can't expect people to die here every week.  
 I'm positive and optimistic, but you're too blind and naive.  
 No need for that.  
 That's the beauty of having these windows.  
 Who knows what's going to happen next?  
 Yeah, we don't have to go out and pull business because we're right here on the street waiting for business to come to the door.  
 The sense of possibility is so good.  
 Today it's an American Express Black Card, tomorrow it could be... . .  
 It's not going to be... . .  
 At other times, a small greeting from a homeless person might be welcome  
 Preface to "The Family of the Patriarchs  
 This used to be my home, and in my absence  
 Marcel got everything I wanted.  
 I will take it back.  
 I pledge my loyalty to you.  
 From now on you hold the key to my kingdom.  
 You will give me up for him once again, will you?  
 All those who love Nikolaus will be rewarded only with pain and death.  
 Nikolaus, she's carrying your child.  
 You must come with me, little wolf girl.  
 I am now under the protection of the almighty Klaus.  
 It's time for my niece Cami to leave this city.  
 Get out of New Orleans and forget everything.  
 Do I know you?  
 You've been hypnotized.  
 It's okay. I can release you from the hypnosis.  
 For centuries, people have come to New Orleans in search of a new beginning.  
 Young French socialites were lured here by the promise of marriage to a noble gentleman of New Orleans, in search of a new beginning, of wealth, adventure and even true love.  
 This is the legendary Casco girl.  
 They do not know that the man who awaits them is no noble gentleman, nor any gentlemanly gentleman.  
 Let them come out. We want to see the women this time.  
 Come out, come out!  
 Come out, we want women.  
 Don't be afraid of the little lamb that has gone astray  
 The bad men are gone  
 We girls have to stick together and support each other.  
 Okay, do you have anything to take away?  
 The story of the Casco girls has been passed down to the present day, and is celebrated today in a form unique to New Orleans, with fashionable fancy dress and supernatural talent.  
 An annual festival honoring the women who were forced by selfish men and the stories of when they fought for themselves and eventually won.  
 Oh my God, that hurts!  
 Apologies to Cami  
 This is the only way to get rid of Klaus's hypnosis.  
 Believe me, I know how much it hurts.  
 You'll be fine. Say you wrote these notes.  
 Don't believe me, Klaus. This is a great way to remember.  
 Nice job.  
 We've been working all night.  
 I don't understand what has happened to me.  
 I don't understand any of this.  
 But you will understand.  
 I will bring you back all the memories that have been taken from you and undo all the hypnosis that the bloodsuckers have put you under.  
 And when it's over, you'll understand it all, and then you'll be free.  
 If you want me to stop.  
 No, don't stop.  
 I want to remember everything.  
 Do you need any help?  
 You might have to use all the bloodsuckers' magical powers.  
 Please let me do it for you.  
 Thank you.  
 I don't think there are many Casco girls with big bellies.  
 I think you look great in that, but I have to... . I know.  
 I know I have to cover up that weird werewolf birthmark.  
 I don't think any of the rabble here would dare harm you, knowing that you are under the protection of our family.  
 But it is better to be careful  
 You've got a big belly and nowhere to go.  
 That's how it is. . ...  
 If you'd like to join the festivities this evening  
 I'd be happy to take you out.  
 You and Klaus are having such a hard time.  
 We don't want to get into trouble, do we?  
 Of course.  
 Elijah.  
 Can you pull the zipper down for me?  
 Yes, of course.  
 It's boring and ugly.  
 Are you talking about clothes or something else?  
 Why do you ask? Is there a lack of security?  
 This holiday can be said to have been created by me  
 I need the best clothes. Leave me alone.  
 - Becca - don't touch me  
 You've made your choice.  
 You've made your choice. You've become Klaus' best friend again.  
 You've given up the right to touch me.  
 Guess who's calling?  
 What's up?  
 Something's wrong.  
 Our little bird has escaped from its cage.  
 You should start to feel a sense of relief.  
 Now your little note is much easier to understand.  
 I promise that if the world stops chasing me  
 I'm sure I'll find the spell of the daylight ring finger.  
 I understand you don't have to worry about that now.  
 I remember why I wrote this  
 I found a picture from 1919.  
 It had Klaus and Marcel on it.  
 Klaus hypnotized me to make a date with Marcel in order to monitor him.  
 He told me yesterday, before he made me forget everything.  
 I remembered  
 Let's continue with the hypnosis we had before.  
 Leave New Orleans and forget me.  
 Your brother was sick at the time.  
 There's no point in staying here.  
 You're not even a detective, but it's clear.  
 Our secret weapon is gone.  
 She's not going to leave like that.  
 She knows the witch is looking for her.  
 And her little fiddle is gone.  
 Mostly, she left of her own free will.  
 What did you say to her in the attic?  
 She lied to me in order to stay there, hoping that you would help her control her powers.  
 How do we know if you took her away?  
 I don't know where Davina is or why she ran away.  
 And can you not come so close to me?  
 I can assure you that I never want to see this child harmed.  
 That harvest ritual has taken too much out of her.  
 The girl you spoke of in your motherly rage is the worst witch in New Orleans.  
 And if she runs away, what is to stop her from destroying us, indeed destroying all our fruits?  
 If she is not our friend, she is our enemy.  
 She is our friend, Klaus.  
 May it be so  
 Lucky for you, I know how to get her back.  
 Come with me.  
 You know how Nikolaus is.  
 If he feels threatened, he becomes cruel and ruthless.  
 That's not good for Davina.  
 I won't let anyone hurt her.  
 And I will not  
 I hear the little witch is gone, isn't she?  
 Apparently, she went out the front door.  
 Do you know what's going on?  
 I don't understand, but I did tell her that the elders were dead.  
 And what do you think she was afraid of when the witches were going to sacrifice her?  
 I think it was because Marcel didn't tell her that the barrier to her freedom had been removed.  
 So you're the one who caused her to leave.  
 I'm just telling the truth.  
 It was she who realized that she was only a weapon used by them to control the witch.  
 I was never on the same side as them.  
 See, Elijah will join them.  
 And with the three of them, it's a sure thing.  
 Used by the witch, deceived by Marcel, manipulated by Elijah, threatened by Klaus.  
 She's the modern-day Casco girl.  
 Are you talking about Davina or yourself?  
 Does it matter?  
 Whatever you say, we girls have to be on the same side.  
 I'm sorry for the disturbance.  
 I've been calling you for an hour.  
 I thought you'd understand.  
 You've been in such a state of confusion since Agnes died.  
 Can you blame me, though?  
 There doesn't seem to be much to do these days.  
 But while you were holding on to all the walking men to hide your pain.  
 I've been looking around, keeping a low profile, listening for news.  
 The daywalkers of Marseille are going up and down the city  
 Look for a girl with brown hair and blue eyes  
 I think I know her.  
 If Davina isn't with Marcel, then he has no way of knowing we're doing it.  
 And if we can find her, we can fix everything.  
 The sun will be searching for more and more bloodsuckers in the lower mountains.  
 I found this one in her old room.  
 Can't we see where she is?  
 Keep drinking.  
 You need vervain in your system so you won't be hypnotized anymore.  
 Cami, do you have any blood bags in the fridge at home?  
 Why would there be? Here.  
 Davina.  
 Someone's doing a spell.  
 They're looking for me.  
 Then we must leave immediately.  
 I can't escape now.  
 Everyone is looking for me.  
 Witch Marcel Kraus  
 My uncle will find a way.  
 - Cami - he knows what is going on here  
 - He knows what's going on here.  
 Unless he was hypnotized too.  
 He knows everything.  
 What are you talking about?  
 He knows.  
 He and Marcel were together.  
 They could be considered friends.  
 I can hear them talking.  
 He knows everything.  
 No, he wouldn't.  
 If he knew that the witch had cast a spell on my brother, he would have told me.  
 Does he really know?  
 Cami!  
 Oh, my God.  
 He knew all along.  
 You should really go, now.  
 Feel free to take any plane, train, or car.  
 Here's my car. It's parked by the yard.  
 I'll give you a message with the exact location.  
 Put your number in Cammy's phone.  
 Most of the French Quarter is closed.  
 We have to walk and the sun never sets  
 Don't cry.  
 As soon as it gets dark, you'll meet us.  
 Okay, don't worry about me.  
 Don't let them find you.  
 I know Klaus told you to follow me, but did you really have to follow me to the bathroom?  
 Call Sophie Devereaux, give me two minutes.  
 It's my OB/GYN.  
 What the hell do you want?  
 I know you don't trust me, but you have to listen to me.  
 Everything is going to change.  
 Davina is free.  
 You know very well, don't you?  
 But what does that have to do with me?  
 I need your help to get the witches to complete the harvest ritual.  
 Am I sick? Why should I help you witches gain more power?  
 You have been casting a spell on me.  
 If we don't complete the harvest ritual, we will lose our powers forever.  
 How do you know about my family?  
 You are one of the Crescent Wolves.  
 Marcel had a witch cast a spell to keep them in wolf form only.  
 Give me a reason to not hang up the phone.  
 Because the witch who cast the spell was my ancestor.  
 You help me with the harvest ritual and I will help you break the spell.  
 But what can I do?  
 I need to sacrifice the body of a powerful witch in order to draw their power.  
 I know of a witch whose body has never been found.  
 Her name is Celeste Doble.  
 You should have a friend in common.  
 Elijah.  
 It is said that after her death, Elijah buried her in a secret place, as she wished.  
 All I need is for you to find that place.  
 Now there are people everywhere.  
 Just keep walking. No one will find you.  
 Cami.  
 We need to get off this street.  
 If anything happens, Kieran will call me.  
 You two look very comfortable.  
 No, I just told Ilya we're wasting our time.  
 Don't you like holiday celebrations?  
 Why not?  
 Why not? The street fair is so busy.  
 Sister, are you here to help us find someone?  
 You can't let your secret weapon fall into the hands of someone else, right?  
 We'll find her soon, just to be clear.  
 That sounds familiar to me, Nikolaus.  
 It is clear that you harbor some nefarious conspiracy.  
 What is it?  
 Timothy.  
 May I have a word with you?  
 Cammy, it's me who's bothering you again.  
 I just want to know where you are so that I can meet you before sunrise.  
 Hello.  
 Joshua, the most disappointing slave I've ever had.  
 If I had called you, you wouldn't have answered.  
 Klaus, how are you?  
 Guess what? I've moved to Turkey.  
 It's strange that the Turks don't eat turkey.  
 - You're lying.  
 Marcel and I were just saying that your double-crossing spy had been exposed, and according to our analysis, you're still in town and with someone.  
 A young, angry witch.  
 No, no, there's no witch here.  
 But the turkey is good.  
 Are you sure you want to leave Davina's true love, Mr. Timothy, alone with me?  
 Josh, what would she think?  
 I promise I just want to talk to her.  
 I'll wait for you at the house with Tim.  
 I really hope she comes home soon.  
 We should go on. How long do we have to wait?  
 Just a few minutes.  
 Then I'll go and see if the coast is clear.  
 Josh, I'm sorry I missed your call.  
 What?  
 I didn't want to tell you at first, but I knew Klaus.  
 If Davina hadn't shown up, he would have killed Tim.  
 We'll think of something.  
 You go to the French Quarter and make sure you don't get caught.  
 We'll think of a way to send you a text message.  
 - I'm going to find him.  
 I can't let Tim die.  
 What's wrong?  
 Those witches!  
 No, no, no.  
 Cami!  
 I'm just going to get some clothes.  
 Give me two minutes, will you?  
 Celeste fascinates me.  
 She's beautiful. She's flawless.  
 She's dead.  
 Even if the sun rises, I'll see nothing but night.  
 But I promised her that if she died, I would bury her far away from all the chaos, from witches and bloodsuckers and all the people.  
 I'm sorry, Elijah.  
 Don't be nervous. It's me. Don't do anything to me.  
 What are you doing here?  
 You should have hid.  
 Yeah, but so should you.  
 But that "I want revenge" look on your face makes me very worried.  
 Are you sure you want to mess with the most evil man in the history of the world?  
 He's the one who took Tim away first and provoked me.  
 I will kill him and all of them.  
 Davina, the original, is unkillable.  
 Perhaps it is possible.  
 I have infinite power.  
 I have never felt it as I do now.  
 That power is building and growing inside me.  
 I'm strong, Josh.  
 If you kill them, then...  
 What?  
 If you really want to do that, then do everything you can.  
 Use all the power you have against them.  
 Sweetly, you will not tell Davina that if she kills Klaus, you will die with her.  
 It's too noble to tell Davina that if she kills Klaus, you'll die with her.  
 The question is, if she were to go to my brother, she would be the one to die.  
 A sadder ending to an already tragic story.  
 Perhaps you would like to help me to help her.  
 Where did Rebecca go?  
 I'm not worried, Rebecca. How can you be sure that Davina will come?  
 To say that would make people think you've forgotten what it's like to be in the throes of a crazy obsession.  
 She will come.  
 Do you need to be so melodramatic, Nikolaus?  
 You have a point.  
 Timothy, could you please play something a little more pleasant?  
 That's a good boy.  
 It's been a long time since you were asked to spread the word.  
 Have you seen his nightwalkers?  
 They're not very smart.  
 Anyway, I finished the mission.  
 When Davina arrives, you two must let me talk to her.  
 You'll have your chance.  
 You're so sweet.  
 Silence is golden. Thank you, Timothy.  
 Davina!  
 I'm already here. Tell him to come down.  
 Then you and I must first talk about your return to us.  
 Do you remember what I said, Klaus?  
 Let me come, Davina. What's going on?  
 Why did you run away? Tell me.  
 I can help you with all of this.  
 How? By threatening my friend's life?  
 Actually, that was my idea, and I'm sorry.  
 Sometimes I go a little overboard to make a point.  
 But it does work.  
 You act like you're so confident, but the truth is...  
 You're afraid to let anyone see you for what you really are... a beast.  
 A beast.  
 Why don't you show us your true face?  
 I've had enough of you.  
 Davina, you don't have to do this.  
 You...  
 You lied to me in front of me, pretending that you were trying to help me.  
 Listen to me.  
 You claim to be a noble man, but like your brother, you are a murderer.  
 For a thousand years, you have fed on the blood of innocent people.  
 Let you try what it is like to choke on blood.  
 As for you  
 I trusted you so much.  
 I loved you so much, but you only used me to consolidate your power.  
 You don't care about me.  
 You were wrong.  
 When you lost to Klaus, you handed me over to him as a trophy.  
 Perhaps I should have thrown you into the boiling copper.  
 I care about you.  
 I treat you like my own  
 No way, my love.  
 Don't tell me you believe him.  
 Shouldn't we have a nice little chat, girls?  
 It's really impressive, and if you ask me, they all deserve it.  
 Before you turn on me.  
 I have a surprise for you.  
 Josh, what are you doing here? Go!  
 What are you doing?  
 If I were Klaus, I would turn  
 If I were Klaus, I would have twisted Josh's head off and fed it to the nightwalkers.  
 But hurting other people is something only boys like to do.  
 It's like how Klaus hypnotized the "little fiddler on the roof." I may be fickle, but I'm definitely not like my brother.  
 It's okay, Timothy. You can come down now.  
 No one is going to hurt you.  
 He said he wouldn't let me climb down from the beam.  
 Then don't climb, you idiot!  
 Am I the only one here with a brain?  
 Davina, how did you do it?  
 How did I get here?  
 I'll explain. I promise.  
 Why are you doing this?  
 It seems to me that you are in control of the whole situation, but you don't know who to trust.  
 I have proven to you that you can trust me.  
 Now I want to show you one more thing.  
 It won't take long.  
 You can take your friends with you.  
 Sophie, I've told you everything.  
 You said he buried her between two lovely oak saplings.  
 That was two hundred years ago.  
 They're big trees now.  
 You want to be an all-powerful witch, then keep looking.  
 Say a prayer. Have some faith.  
 You can do it.  
 All right.  
 Please, please help me.  
 I'm trying to do the right thing.  
 Don't worry.  
 They're not really dead, they're just hungry, and that's not going to make it any better.  
 Do you think my brother Nik is bad?  
 Marcel studied under him.  
 That's how he treated his so-called friends who betrayed him.  
 Most of the poor guys around here don't do anything more than Josh does.  
 Like Thierry.  
 He was Marcel's most trusted friend.  
 Claude induced him to break one of Marcel's rules.  
 Marcel knew this and still kept Thierry  
 He was locked in here day and night.  
 It's crazy.  
 Why are you telling me this?  
 Because you know who you have to deal with and who you can trust.  
 It's okay.  
 You'll be fine.  
 Here, have some water.  
 Davina, you and I, we've both been tricked, used by Marcel and Klaus.  
 Maybe if we join forces we can give them a little revenge.  
 Everyone!  
 Tim!  
 He made me do it, Klaus.  
 I didn't even know what I was doing before, did I let you?  
 What did I make her do?  
 Drink.  
 Tim?  
 Klaus poisoned the water.  
 Tim?  
 Davina  
 No!  
 Kami, how are you doing?  
 Have you eaten today?  
 You must have passed out.  
 Yes, perhaps I was mysteriously knocked out by three witches.  
 Where's Davina?  
 Does your friend Marcel know she's here?  
 Cami, I can explain.  
 Bloodsucking witches.  
 My brother, your nephew is under the spell of a witch.  
 How could you keep this from me?  
 It's complicated.  
 There are so many things you don't understand.  
 You hide the truth from me.  
 You let me believe that Sean was crazy, that I was crazy, instead of telling me the truth.  
 I was protecting you.  
 You saw what happened to Sean.  
 Cami Batto.  
 Stay away from me.  
 You're just as bad as the rest of the freaks in this town.  
 Isn't that awkward?  
 Rebecca, where are you?  
 I'm with Davina, and she's dying because of your betrayal.  
 I tried to get her to stop admiring Marcel so much, but she made it clear that she wasn't our friend.  
 If you think she is your friend, then I deeply regret it.  
 Tell me how to save her  
 The blood of a bloodsucker does not work  
 Yes, it won't work.  
 The poison I made Timothy give her was very effective.  
 It's only a matter of time before she dies.  
 It's the two of them, you cruel bastards.  
 They were still children.  
 We could have dealt with her fairly.  
 There's no need to talk about deals with people who threaten us.  
 Davina's fate was sealed from the moment she confronted me.  
 It was her choice, not mine.  
 Don't be like that.  
 The stench you accuse me of is overwhelming.  
 Do I need to remind you that Davina is bigger than all of us?  
 I just did what I had to do.  
 Don't worry, Elijah. I'm still as redeemable as ever.  
 So you controlled the boy to poison Davina without asking Marcel and me.  
 Do you know what the worst problem is?  
 It's that you're too easy to see through.  
 I can't help but make an alliance with your brother. I don't like him at all.  
 You sound like you have something you want to talk to me about.  
 You're right.  
 Kieran called me earlier, just after Sabine and the other witches had laid hands on Davina.  
 Hello.  
 Let me guess the protection spell?  
 Do you think I'd waste a day of magic doing nothing?  
 They should have done the same thing.  
 You disobeyed my rules, Sabine, and by my reckoning, your protection spell should be a one-time thing.  
 I give you two choices, you can either go and be with your friends right now, or you can cast the same protection spell for one of my witch friends.  
 You probably know who I'm talking about.  
 So when you claim to have gone to see what happened to the nocturnal bloodsucker, you were actually conspiring with a witch.  
 Very clever.  
 I should be proud of myself.  
 I was really just trying to  
 Just as Elijah predicted, you're beginning to show your true nature.  
 But this time you have chosen to make an alliance with a witch, who I know has always been our enemy, a threat to our family.  
 Davina is Marcel's family, Niklaus, but you want to take her life, haven't you forgotten that?  
 Call Rebecca.  
 Tell her that Davina will be restored.  
 Unfortunately, the boy won't survive.  
 Tim?  
 Tim! Tim! Tim!  
 Tim, Tim, wake up! Wake up! Wake up!  
 Open your eyes. No, no, no.  
 Come on, wake up!  
 Don't leave me alone!  
 Is she okay?  
 She's broken and exhausted.  
 Where's her room?  
 Leave it to me.  
 I'll do it.  
 Some people say it's a man's world, and sometimes it is.  
 Although many Casco girls are rescued, there is a limit.  
 She will never trust me again.  
 Maybe.  
 But you must never give up on regaining her trust.  
 But women are actually more rebellious than the world thinks.  
 What are these paintings?  
 She had been drawing them in the attic when she felt the magic, and they were different.  
 These she called evil.  
 And some of the women  
 You could say that those who had oppressed them had better be careful.  
 Surprised to see me?  
 After all, you had the idea to control me and keep me away.  
 You remember.  
 It's all because of the release of control  
 It hurts like hell, but it's worth it.  
 It made me understand why I wanted to stay.  
 By the way, Klaus, if you ever hurt Davina and Josh again, I'll expose you to the world and you can kiss the French quarter goodbye.  
 Good evening.  
 I'm rebellious too, and I've had enough of being oppressed.  
 For a thousand years, my brother has been doing whatever he wants, without any concern for the consequences.  
 Marcel seems to have acquiesced, while Elijah stays by his side, foolishly waiting for him to change one day.  
 Men are assholes.  
 What do you want me to do?  
 Even though you warned Marcel, he can't seem to give up on my brother.  
 They ruled this city side by side and left you to rot here.  
 I want you to help me take back New Orleans while they watch, and I have a secret weapon, a mole.  
 She's a very rebellious girl herself.  
 Are you all right?  
 I'm much better now.  
 How are you today?  
 It's not good.  
 What are these drawings?  
 Davina's sketches  
 I don't know if they represent something or not  
 They seem to be a sign of something to come  
 It seems to be a bad omen.  
 Oh my God, isn't that  
 Hello, Celeste.  
 Come on, Sophie, pick up the phone.  
 My brothers and I are the first bloodsuckers in history.  
 The first bloodsuckers were the original family.  
 Three hundred years ago, we helped found New Orleans.  
 Now we have returned to this warring city.  
 The Bloodsucker Marcel leads an army against a group of desperate witches.  
 My brother Klaus was against both of them, thirsty for power, wanting to protect the werewolf who carried his child.  
 But Marcel had an advantage. He captured our brother Elijah with the help of a secret weapon.  
 Now, in order to save my beloved brother  
 I have no choice but to support the brother whom I cannot trust.  
 In August 1359  
 I have noticed a difference between brother and sister  
 The bond between us was tightened by the pressure of the bloodsuckers' life  
 Once the demonic nature of the bloodsuckers took hold of us, we became more and more distant from human nature.  
 My beloved sister, Rebecca, was becoming more and more indifferent and heartless.  
 The biggest problem, however, is Nikolaus  
 He still conceals his loneliness with his cruelty  
 But I still believe that I, as their elder brother, can lead them back to the right path, guided by the power of the family.  
 If I fail, our family will only fall in darkness.  
 I can't believe you didn't wait for me to take care of those bloodsuckers myself.  
 I know I love to burn everything.  
 Should I leave them in the front yard to rot?  
 Then again, they are my responsibility.  
 They attacked the helpless little pregnant woman who was carrying my child.  
 I am so moved by your duty to the new father of the werewolf who is carrying your half-breed child.  
 I am so touched.  
 The wolf girl wants to know what the plan is.  
 Depends on what plan you're talking about.  
 Is it my plan to rule the world, or is it Rebecca's plan to find true love in a cruel world?  
 The plan to rescue Elijah, you know, the good brother.  
 The one you put a dagger in the back of, the one who is now under the control of your sworn enemy.  
 To be clear, from before  
 You two said you'd get him back.  
 So, do we have a plan now?  
 Okay.  
 First of all, Marcel is not my mortal enemy.  
 He's my friend, even though he doesn't realize I'm trying to break his control over the entire supernatural zone, but still, he's a friend.  
 Secondly, I used the dagger to seal Elijah in order to win Marcel's trust.  
 If I had known that he was going to let my brother be controlled by a particularly irascible teenage wizard  
 I would have considered making a slightly different choice.  
 The third point is that the plan, as you requested, is for Nikolaus to ask Marcel directly for Elijah.  
 That's not the whole plan, is it?  
 Baito.  
 Claus may have been an unworthy brother, but he had no other bad intentions.  
 That's the only plan, the beloved one.  
 But there's always a backup plan.  
 What's a backup plan?  
 I'm too handsome in a suit.  
 Joshua Rosen, 18 years old, is now in the news for tourists who have recently arrived in New Orleans as... . ...  
 I will voluntarily come forward as a witness under the hand of the head of the code to testify that he saw  
 These two drunken men fell into the Mississippi River, and they'll be investigated for weeks.  
 No one will be around to see them.  
 Well, that's good, considering one died in a trash can behind the county morgue and the other is now a bloodsucker.  
 Anything else?  
 Please let me love you.  
 One more thing.  
 I sent out four nocturnal bloodsuckers to investigate a werewolf that had been spotted in the legal district.  
 I haven't heard from them since.  
 So, last week, there were 10 dead nocturnal bloodsuckers.  
 Do you think the werewolves are back here trying to cause a nuisance?  
 I know you and Klaus were friends.  
 But the truth is, ever since the originals showed up, shut up, Thierry.  
 You're not still mad at me for the little poisoned werewolf bite I gave you earlier, are you?  
 I thought that was a thing of the past.  
 I see you've given him the right to move freely in the area now.  
 It's all right. Think of it as my family and me.  
 We lived here and built this place, in fact.  
 Come on, don't be like that.  
 You both know the rules.  
 Thierry is my man, a close friend.  
 Klaus is my old friend and loyalist.  
 And a guest here.  
 Shall we live together in peace? Shall we?  
 What do you need, brother?  
 I think my sister, Rebecca, insisted that I return to Elijah.  
 She was very angry about it.  
 Of course  
 We're about to have three patriarchs in town, aren't we?  
 Half of us think that his sister killed the Night Vampire.  
 Is that an accusation against an ancestor?  
 Didn't I just say that we should live together in peace?  
 Come with me.  
 Come with me.  
 Your cronies lack a sense of secrecy.  
 He is a little overprotective, but he is faithful.  
 I saved him in the '40s when I found him outside the VA hospital, dying of a war wound.  
 He would have killed for me. He would have died for me.  
 And the boy who played the trumpet was so good.  
 Maybe we'll see if we can get him to play at the party tonight.  
 You'll be here, right?  
 How could I pass up the opportunity to meet the congressman who is the recipient of a huge charity donation from you?  
 He's a dumbass, but he allows us to do our own thing for some community service.  
 Like not pointing our fangs at the local people.  
 Listen.  
 I'd love to help you out with your brother, but Thierry's right.  
 My people are tense and unsettled.  
 They see the Patriarchs coming back here with dead bloodsuckers, and it makes them very nervous.  
 If I were to give you Elijah now, it might give them the wrong impression that they don't know who's the real boss here.  
 You know what I mean.  
 You must understand. I must not say anything.  
 How long does it take Klaus to ask a simple question for Mary Magdalene?  
 It takes longer than you think, because the answer is, as expected, a no-go.  
 Marcel's man Thierry was suspicious.  
 He was absolutely sure that you killed 10 nocturnal bloodsuckers.  
 Lying. I only killed eight.  
 Should I have made Thierry the ninth?  
 Marcel is pretending to be friendly.  
 We can't kill his favorite son, or he'll turn on us.  
 - Then let's go to war.  
 Do you know how to deal with the witch?  
 - I think I do.  
 You deal with Sophie Devereaux.  
 I'll be in charge of the next step.  
 I order you to bleed him dry.  
 What took you so long?  
 I'm sorry, I'm not some medieval torture expert.  
 What did he do to you after all?  
 It's not about what he did.  
 It's what he'll do when we're done, which is whatever I want him to do, just like you.  
 Like stabbing him in the body with this.  
 That's crazy.  
 I didn't want to do it, but I did.  
 It's called psychic control.  
 Bloodsuckers can control people.  
 Ancestors like me and my brothers and sisters can control bloodsuckers, and no one can control ancestors.  
 Do you understand? Good.  
 That's why a brand-new nocturnal bloodsucker like you is here, obeying my orders without anyone noticing.  
 But my blood has never drained.  
 Yes, well, young Joshua, because I had control over you when there was not a trace of vervain in your body.  
 Vervain stops control.  
 Marcel had all his companions start drinking vervain when I came back.  
 That is why our friend needs to be drained of blood so that I can control him to do my bidding.  
 Now that my brother is in captivity awaiting my rescue  
 We can't be so gentle.  
 I'm glad you're here.  
 While you dawdle.    
 Elijah lay rotting with a dagger in his head.  
 You're lucky I'm here.  
 What do you want?  
 Last night, Haley was attacked by Marcel's men because someone told him they saw a werewolf in the French Quarter.  
 She'd only been to one place.  
 Whoever saw it, she sold her.  
 Watch and learn.  
 - Good for you, Sophie.  
 It's full of marigolds. They're very attractive to the opposite sex. They're perfect for you.  
 Deeply suspicious.  
 Do you have any others? - Yes... Yes... I don't know.  
 I don't know. Maybe it's a crocus.  
 Why do you want that one?  
 Don't play dumb with me.  
 Rebecca.  
 I only sold some herbs to the werewolf, that's all.  
 Are you lying to me, Katie?  
 I suggest you answer my questions honestly.  
 Answer her questions, Katy Baito.  
 Yes.  
 I told someone else, but you don't understand.  
 I love him.  
 Tell me who your bloodsucker lover is.  
 Shall I count down?  
 Hurry up!  
 I have a whole army to build. A controlled servant is not an army.  
 So what?  
 You're right. Who's the traitor?  
 Fortunately, she's just a child who doesn't know anything about us or what we're up to.  
 Do you want to hear what would make you happiest?  
 Go ahead.  
 She was in love with one of Marcel's cronies.  
 Guess who?  
 A right hand, a right arm, a right hand.  
 Two extra points for a correct answer.  
 Thierry is getting closer and closer to his enemies.  
 That means he's unwittingly becoming the linchpin of our entire program.  
 I told you it would make you happy.  
 In a city where bloodsuckers and witches face each other, the bloodthirsty are in love.  
 That's a bummer.  
 Are you crazy? - No.  
 - No, it's easy.  
 All we need is for you to cast a small, very small locator spell to help us find our brother.  
 Any witch in town who uses magic will be caught and killed.  
 Yes, that's right.  
 It seems you left out an important detail in our dealings.  
 Marcel's secret weapon. He knows how witches use magic.  
 Such a tall girl is cute and easy to get mad at.  
 Davina  
 Where did you see her?  
 I don't know.  
 That little brat erased my memory after she threw me out of the window with the idea that she deserved to die.  
 Let me get to the point.  
 Elijah in Davina's hand  
 You witches, I think, would like to separate Davina from Marcel.  
 We don't know where she is.  
 That's why we need magic.  
 Davina will feel it.  
 Except, of course, for the other witch.  
 For example, for a traitor  
 Like Katie  
 while casting a stronger magic spell  
 That would create a fog that would hide your little spell from Davina.  
 Katie should not die.  
 Sophie Devereaux.  
 You can't be so principled.  
 You can't win a war without a strategic loss, no matter how regrettable that loss might be.  
 How often do bloodsuckers get ahead of the game and learn things they shouldn't know?   
 Your sister was executed in the public square for using magic, and who knew she would be caught first?  
 Did she try to escape?  
 She was hiding in the cargo hold of a freighter, and was caught just as it was about to set sail on the Mississippi River.  
 And who asked you to tell me that one of Marcel's most important confidants was in charge of his yard business?  
 Katie's boyfriend, Thierry.  
 You're right. He was right.  
 Right? I call him the musician.  
 The girls loved him, but he had his heart set on something else.  
 He always surrounds himself with his beautiful little witch and says he loves her, but I don't know.  
 Your most important warrior and your enemy have a strong bond, but you don't care.  
 I do, of course, but Thierry is a grown man now.  
 He'll make his own decisions, and I'll get some important information.  
 Besides, he wouldn't do anything to jeopardize our business.  
 You see, a bloodsucker is running an extravagant charity party.  
 We're a whole lot of people here, and no one's going to break it.  
 But...  
 Wouldn't you want those witches to be too bold, considering one of them said there were werewolves in town?  
 Which led to the disappearance of your nocturnal bloodsucker.  
 I'm sure you've considered the possibility that it might be a trap.  
 Perhaps it's time for me to give a hint.  
 Thierry.  
 Take a team of nocturnal vampires to the witch's place tonight for a little disturbance.  
 Thierry didn't have to be polite.  
 So then I moved back here to be closer to my brothers, because  
 To tell the truth, family is the most important thing, right, Camille?  
 Call me Cammy. I'll have to change my badge.  
 Drunk people like to talk to me in French.  
 Are you sure you've never been here before?  
 You look familiar.  
 You must have seen me walking around outside.  
 Aren't you dating Marcel Gerard?  
 He's a friend of mine, sort of.  
 I heard he liked Blondie's bartender back in Rousseau.  
 I wouldn't call that a date.  
 He was courting me, sort of.  
 I don't know.  
 He's very charming.  
 Which probably means I should get out of here.  
 I'm in a bit of a break-up situation myself.  
 That's the worst, isn't it?   
 There are things you can't let go of, even though you won't fall for them, and you always understand.  
 I like you, Cami.  
 Most girls are annoyingly whiny and sarcastic.  
 Thank you.    
 I should go to this extravagant charity party this evening at this charity house.  
 He looks a little like Gatsby throwing a shitty party.  
 Interested?  
 Hey, little sister.  
 Brother, I believe I have a guarantee.  
 Marcel will be a little distracted tonight.  
 Should I ask?  
 I can only say that his attention will not be on us.  
 I did my best.  
 What are you doing to ensure the safe return of Elijah?  
 Now, I'm preparing an insurance policy in case I'm soft-hearted.  
 What do you mean?  
 We need to make the right motive for Katie to cast a strong spell tonight.  
 I'm working on the motive.  
 Marcel gave the order to disturb the witch.  
 No.  
 I'll just turn around and arrange for things to go tragically wrong.  
 Do you understand what you have to do?  
 No problem.  
 What's going on outside?  
 It was Klaus.  
 He made Marcel think that the witch was planning to take action against him.  
 Marcel wanted us to give a hint if he thought I was favoring him because I was in love with a witch.  
 Say it again.  
 I love you, Katie, and everything is going to be okay, I promise.  
 Marcel may not care about Thierry, with all that you and me.  
 I've already been there.  
 But there's still some sin for him.  
 Not so easy to forgive.  
 Thierry.  
 Let her go. Get out of here.  
 Killing one of your own colleagues is one.  
 That would be inexcusable.  
 If Katie wants to save her lover from Marcel's punishment, and wants to save him  
 She must use magic, but then again  
 What's worth giving your life for other than love? 
 I have to say that the background music is very appropriate for this evening  
 What is she doing here?  
 What better way to distract Marcel's little human girlfriend than to put him in a place where bloodsuckers are all over the place?  
 You're so sweet. You're so beautiful.  
 This party is ridiculous, but I think I'm going to enjoy it slowly.  
 He's the notoriously unpredictable family man.  
 In fact, the one you're talking about is my brother and my sister is right.  
 You are indeed very beautiful.  
 And you look great in that outfit.  
 Don't be fooled, my dear.  
 I'm a wolf in sheep's clothing.  
 You two talk. I'd like some wine.  
 - Shall we dance?  
 - Yes, please.  
 Scotch, thank you.  
 Did you invite her here to make yourself desirable?  
 I think she's precious.  
 I dare say it's her pure heart that you love.  
 Maybe one day I'll feed it to you myself.  
 You look so good when you're jealous, Rebecca.  
 The person Rebecca was talking about.  
 I think it should be Marcel.  
 I wouldn't think so much about it.  
 It's an old story.  
 I was thinking about your sister being a bitch.  
 I think she even coined that word.  
 Listen.  
 Allow me to leave for a moment.  
 Cami  
 Killer dance party  
 It's for business.  
 I was going to invite you... . ...  
 It's okay, it's just a date.  
 There's no need to explain anything.  
 You do your thing and I'll enjoy myself  
 Why do I leave you alone?  
 Seeing you with someone else  
 Don't even think about it.  
 You shouldn't have come here.  
 Who are you?  
 I'm sorry. I didn't mean to scare you.  
 I'm Sabine. We've met.  
 I'm Sophie's friend.  
 You're the witch here.  
 Sophie asked me to come over and keep you company while everyone else was out playing.    
 It was drawn to your child in your belly.  
 Half bloodsucker, half werewolf.  
 You and Klaus created a very special thing.  
 You speak like Elijah.  
 He thought the child would make a happy family for us, but now he's gone, and... . .  
 I don't even know what it is... . .  
 What is it?  
 Listen, if you want, I can help you.  
 I mean, help you know if it's male or female.  
 I thought you couldn't use witchcraft here.  
 It's not witchcraft, it's just an old trick.  
 Come on.  
 You must be a little curious. 
 I thought you said you were in community work.  
 Community fundraising.  
 You run parties and get people to open their wallets and give money.    
 That's what I do.  
 I'm probably what you'd call a bad but essential person.  
 What about Rebecca? Is she one of your donors?  
 She's an old friend.  
 Not too old, either.  
 She looks younger than me.  
 You'd be surprised.  
 I was just a kid when I met her.  
 Don't talk about her anymore.  
 I just want to be with you.  
 You really are a horrible little devil, aren't you?  
 No, they're perfect for each other.  
 You want to split Marcel's heart, that's it.  
 I should go.  
 Excuse me.  
 What the hell did you do?  
 Don't say it here. 
 Say it somewhere else.  
 I know you think he's a beast.  
 How could I not think it's important?  
 Thierry killed another bloodsucker.  
 He broke the most important rule in Marcel.  
 You'll never see him again.  
 Unless we do something.  
 "We"?  
 I want to save my people.  
 Do you want to save Thierry?  
 There is only one way to achieve both.  
 Are you ready?  
 Something's going to happen to Marcel.  
 Magic.  
 I want to hear what you have to say.  
 Marcel, don't do this.  
 Your copy says  
 We were throwing pots and pans at the time.  
 That man, some nocturnal bloodsucker, attacked Katie for no apparent reason.  
 His name is Max. I turned him.  
 He didn't need any reason.  
 She was a witch, and he was a bloodsucker.  
 And now he's dead.  
 I didn't mean to.  
 You've broken my most important rule.  
 Damn it. How long have we been friends? Seventy years.  
 Yes, I did.  
 I turned you into an immortal.  
 I gave you a gift.  
 I have always been faithful to you, and I am still faithful.  
 I am still your friend, Marcel.  
 I swear it hasn't changed.  
 You're right, my dear.  
 He's got a temper, doesn't he?  
 Maybe now I should remember that I knew it would be like this.  
 We found this at his girl's place.  
 He's still my friend, isn't he?  
 That's funny.  
 Because your little witch has the spell I've been keeping locked up in her hand.  
 Marcel, I've never seen this one before.  
 Shut up!  
 I see you're still wearing the daylight ring I gave you on your hand.  
 Why do you need the recipe for the ring? Unless you're going to betray me and Katie and start a new family?  
 No, Marcel.  
 Let me teach you what it means to be a friend.  
 Friends don't lie to me, break my rules, or steal what's mine.  
 For the crime of conspiring to kill his companion  
 I sentence Thierry Fanshawe to be imprisoned in the garden for 10 years.  
 It's showtime!  
 Your decision is correct.  
 This is the only way to find Elijah.  
 I just did what I had to do.  
 No, Katie.  
 It's the right time.  
 Hurry up.  
 No.  
 Are you here to save your man?  
 Come on, you little girl!  
 Go to hell, you bitch!  
 No, Katie!  
 Something's not right.  
 Katie's magic has stopped.  
 I can continue.  
 No, she'll notice.  
 I can find Davina. Just give me a little more time.  
 You may fight to get your witch back, but Haley and the children will follow you to their deaths.  
 Elijah will never forgive us for saving him, and it will be meaningless.  
 It's over. We've failed.  
 No, Katie, no, no, no.  
 No! No! No!  
 Tell me.  
 Is she worth it?  
 I love him.  
 Seal him up and let him rot here.  
 How much did Cami see?  
 All she saw was a fight, man.  
 There's nothing you can't handle.  
 You really like her, don't you?  
 I liked that she wasn't involved in all of this.  
 Sometimes it's nice to see the world from a human point of view.  
 I'm sorry about Thierry.  
 I can see that he was a good friend of yours.  
 I made him up.  
 Obviously, I shouldn't have trusted him.  
 It doesn't make it any better.  
 You saved my life tonight, and I owe you a debt of gratitude.  
 You want your brother back.  
 It's the only thing I can do for you.  
 - Cammy.  
 - Don't even think about it.  
 I know why you're here.  
 You're here to say something nice for your friend.  
 You're a good man, but... . But...  
 But you've been hurt before, and you don't want to try it again.  
 And so on and so forth.  
 The man I saw tonight was not the man I thought he would be if he could get angry like that so easily . . .  
 It sounds like more than ordinary heartbreak.  
 It seems someone has betrayed your trust.  
 The courageous bartender, Camille.  
 I'm sorry.  
 But I hope you will give Marcel another chance.  
 I guess I was wrong about that.  
 No, you're right, but we both have our roles to play.  
 You went to see Marcel and danced with him.  
 You felt bad for him for arguing with his friends, but other than that, you just remembered that he was perfect.  
 Tonight was a complete failure.  
 Cha-cha-cha, the opposite, sister.  
 Tonight was a great success.  
 Are you crazy?  
 Katie died before Sophie could finish the spell.  
 I know exactly what I did. I killed Katie.  
 What did you do?  
 Our little death-seeking witch has no reason to  
 Not trying to bury Marcel with her.  
 I saved his life. That's why.  
 He did exactly what I wanted.  
 Sophie trusts you.  
 I trust you, not my more trustworthy instincts.  
 Wake up, Rebecca.  
 The witches are planning only for themselves.  
 They only want Davina, the girl, and when they have her, what do you think the truce will be?  
 No, of course not.  
 They will use Davina's power against all of us.  
 Even if you're right, the plan was to find Elijah, and you've let us down.  
 You always had a lack of faith in me.  
 By protecting Marcel, he trusted me more, so much so that he agreed to return Elijah to us when the time came.  
 When he has told me all about Davina.  
 I will take control of her myself.  
 I don't doubt that you can do what you want, Nik.  
 You have always done so, regardless of the price paid by the rest of us.  
 You make me sick.  
 Are you all right? I'm worried.  
 Thank you.  
 I feel everything you've done.  
 You've helped me.  
 It was those old guys, wasn't it?  
 In fact, Klaus is the one who saved me tonight.  
 I'm going to make things right, starting with the return of his brother.  
 No.  
 What is it?  
 - Davina.   
 - No.  
 You said the old gang was dangerous.  
 I won't give them back until I know how to kill them.  
 I thought you might want to know.  
 Elijah is coming back.  
 KUNG HEI  
 I think there is good in being evil.  
 You don't understand him, but you think of him.  
 Why is my brother always admired?  
 He was good to me.  
 Sometimes I wonder if my family will ever be saved.  
 I have learned something today.  
 I feel like a girl  
 But every time I want to give up, I see a glimmer of goodness that makes me believe in salvation.    
 You are following me  
 Perhaps you are in my way  
 I told you that this band of sinful allies would bring no good.  
 At least I did something.  
 And you?  
 Sabine told them what you saw.  
 It was the werewolf girl.  
 I think it was a girl.  
 No. 
 Wait! Wait!  
 Wait for what?  
 Tell me it's not a little Klaus
