 - Are you excited about our honeymoon ?
 - Yeah , I am .
 Get it out of your system while we 're alone .
 - We came to say goodbye . 
 - Have a great honeymoon .
 - Thanks .
 - I 'll go pack . 
 I already packed .
 But I couldn 't find your Speedo .
 Speedo ? I don 't have a Speedo .
 I 'm gonna go pack my regular , long bathing suit .
 Good , you 're still here ! 
 Have a good honeymoon .
 Oh , thank you !
 And I wanted you guys to know I am telling the father today .
 What ? What ? What ?
 - We know it 's Ross . 
 - How ? How do you know ?
 It was his sweater . 
 But , oh , my God !
 I wanted Ross to know first . 
 But I 'm relieved !
 - I 'm gonna be your baby 's aunt ! 
 - I know .
 - Me too !
 - I 'm gonna be an uncle !
 Come here . 
 - You 'll all be aunts and uncles .
 - But I 'm the only one related by blood .
 Now that you all know , you can give me advice on how to tell Ross .
 What 'll you say ?
 That I 'm having it .
 And he can be as involved as he wants . 
 That sounds good .
 Yeah , but how do I start ?
 What 's the first thing that I say ?
 - Okay , great . Thanks .
 - Hey , good luck . Yeah , bye .
 What was that about ?
 No harm in telling you now .
 Rachel and Ross are having a baby . 
 What ? I didn 't even know !
 Why didn 't you tell me ?
 Why am I talking like this ?
 I didn 't think you could keep it a secret .
 I 'm an excellent secret- keeper .
 I 've kept all our secrets .
 - What secrets ?
 - No , no , Joey .
 I 'm not gonna tell you because I am an excellent secret- keeper .
 - You 'll tell me later ?
 - You already know . The One Where Rachel Tells Ross
 It 's so romantic to send people off on their honeymoon .
 You know , they 're married .
 Ross and Rachel are having a baby .
 - Maybe you and I should do something .
 - All in good time , my love . 
 I left my guitar in their apartment .
 You can let me in , right ? 
 They took my key to give to you .
 - What ?
 They took mine to give to you .
 - Why would they take our keys ?
 - Maybe they don 't trust us .
 - They let me keep my key last time .
 When you broke the ketchup bottle and cleaned it with Monica 's towels ?
 - I washed those .
 - No , you didn 't . Yeah , that didn 't sound like me .
 - I really need my guitar . 
 - I have stuff in there too .
 - What stuff ? 
 - Monica 's chicken parm .I 'll fix it .
 Mr. Treeger ?
 I need to get into Monica 's apartment .
 It 's an emergency ! 
 Gas leak .
 Oh , and bring garlic bread .
 - Did Rachel find you ? 
 - No , why ?
 - She was looking for you .
 - I guess I 'll catch up with her later .
 - She really wanted to talk to you now . 
 - Yeah , it seemed pretty important .
 - Oh , no . - What ?
 I think I might know what this is about .
 Really ?
 Yeah . We promised we weren 't gonna tell anybody this ... ... but a month ago , Rachel and I slept together .
 And ?
- Wow , I thought you 'd be more shocked .
 - Oh , sorry .And ? !
 Well , we said we 'd just do it that one time ... ... but now I think she may wanna start things up again .
 Yeah , I don 't think that 's what it is .
 - Why ?
 What else could it be ?
 - Oh , wow , I don 't feel well .
 I 'm telling you , that 's what it is .
 No wonder she was looking at me funny at the wedding .
 She didn 't say anything to you ?
 Maybe it 's something you ate .
 - Please , just go and talk to Rachel .
 - Yeah , I guess I should .
 You know what I have to realize ?
 I 'm not the type of guy women can have just one night with .
 They always seem to want a little bit more .
 I should remember that .
 Next .
 - They 're kissing , let 's go around .
 - They 're in love . I 'm in love too . But in an orderly fashion .
 - Next .
 - Hi . Can you do that and walk ?
 Sorry , we didn 't hear you .
 We 're on our honeymoon .
 Let me see what I can do .
 There are some first class seats .
 They bumped them up to first class !
 Let 's act like we 're on our honeymoon .
 We are on our honeymoon .
 - Grab my ass . 
- Next .
 Sorry , I almost didn 't hear you .
 I 'm so in love with my new husband .
 - We 're on our honeymoon .
 - Congratulations .
 Mr. Bing , you 'll be in 25J , and Mrs. Bing , you 're in 25K .
 We 're on our honeymoon , so can you bump us up to first class ?
 I 'm sorry , that couple got the last two seats .
 If we 'd gone around them like I said , she 'd have given us those tickets !
 25J and K , any chance those aren 't together ?
 They took my key . You trust me with yours .
 Of course , and I 'll give it back ... 
... when they 're done at the key shining place .
 What the hell is that ?
 - What are you doing ?
 - You said there was a gas leak .
 - Why don 't you use your key ?
 - I won 't find it before it explodes .
 If that happens at another building I manage , people will ask questions .
 We could have done that .
 They 're going into the first class lounge .
 - You know what 's in there ? - No .
 Me neither . We have to get in !
 - Just act like you belong .
 - Oh , my God ! Oranges !
 - Nice to see you again .
 - May I see your tickets , please ?
 Yes , of course .
 I can 't see the seat number .
 That 's all right . I have it memorized . It 's 1A .
 - This isn 't first class , sorry .
 - Apology accepted .
 Sir , I 'm afraid I 'm going to have to ask you to leave . 
 Fine . Go , go , go !
 I think there 's something that we really need to talk about .
 I think we do . Why don 't we go inside ?
 - Look , I know why you 're here .
 - You do ?
 Yeah , and to save you from any embarrassment , I should talk first .
 Ross and Rachel .
 Rachel and Ross .
 It 's been one heck of a seesaw , hasn 't it ?
 What ?
 I mean , look , that one night we had was fun and certainly passionate .
 But don 't you think it 's better if we just stay friends ?
 Seriously , what ?
 You know what ?
 If you want to , we can do it one more time .
 I 'd be okay with that .
 In fact , I have some time right now .
 - You know what ? Can I talk now ?
 - Oh , sure .
 I 'm pregnant .
 Ross ?
 Ross ?
 Okay , whenever you 're ready .
 And you 're the father , by the way .
 - Can I get you some water ?
 - I 'm good , I 'm good .
 Ross , there is no pressure on you .
 You can be as involved as you want .
 Yeah , I ...
 I 'm just , I don 't know .
 I don 't understand ... ... how this happened .
 - We used a condom .
 - I know .
 But you know , condoms only work , like , 97 % of the time . What ?
 What ?
 What ? ! Well , they should put that on the box !
 - They do .
 - No , they don 't !
 Well , they should put it in huge block letters !
 - Let 's just forget about the condoms . 
 - Well , I may as well have !
 - I was really freaked out too when ...
 - Freaked out ? I 'm not freaked out .
 I 'm indignant as a consumer !
- You know what ?
 Let 's talk later .
 - No , I wanna talk now .
 In fact , I wanna talk to the president of the condom company .
 Okay , maybe I should come back ...
 Yeah , I 'll press one !
 - I looked everywhere . No gas leak .
 - So now I can heat this up ?
 I 'll get moving on that door . Great .
 Could you not tell Chandler and Monica about this ?
 They don 't have any kids of their own ... ... and this door was like a child to them .
 I have to put in a new lock .
 They 'll find out anyway .
 This looks like an all- day job .
 I 'll have to cancel my yoga class .
 Could you tell Jasmine I can 't make it to yoga ?
 - Sure .
 - What happened to the door ?
 - So it 's noticeable ? 
 - Is Rachel here ?
 - Didn 't you two already talk ?
 Yeah , but ...
 You guys know Rachel and I slept together , but there 's something else .
 Rachel 's pregnant . 
 - Holy mother of God !
 - I can 't believe it !
 - With my child .
 - That is brand- new information !
 - You already know , don 't you ?
 - A little bit .
 - How you doing ?
 - Okay . I mean , I 'll be okay .
 I didn 't handle it well .
 - What 'd you say ?
 - Nothing . But the complaint department at the condom company got an earful .
 Then when I turned around , she was gone .
 But in my defense , I found out that condoms are only 97 % effective .
 - What ? - I gotta go find her .
 Hold on !
 Are you serious ?
 So , like , 3 % of the time they don 't even work ?
 They should put that on the box !
 - Evidently , they do . 
 - What ? !
 - I can 't believe we 're here .
 - You 've gotta be kidding .
 As a wedding gift , we 're giving you the Honeymoon Suite .
 No ! You have been screwing us all day !
 - Who are you ? - We 're you .
 Just 10 seconds later ! 
 You got first class , the lounge .
 We need free stuff !
 You 're not the only ones on your honeymoon !
 You can have the suite .
 We don 't care where we stay .
 We 're here to celebrate our love .
 We just want to be together .
 We need the stuff .
 Hey , it 's Joey .
 We smell gas from your apartment .
 - Are you serious ?
 Joey smells gas .
 - What else is new ?
 - We 'd check it , but you took our keys .
 - Do something .Get in ! 
 I could break down your door .
 - Yeah , do that .
 - You won 't blame us for any damage ?
 - No . 
- Are you doing it ?
 I can 't hear .
 - Okay , I 'll break it down .
 He 's doing it , he 's breaking down the door .
 Okay , we 're in .
 - Rachel , are you comfortable ?
 - If I said I was , would you judge me ?
 The doctor 'll be here in a minute to do your sonogram .
 Oh , man , I swear , if they sold these at Pottery Barn ...
 We need to talk .
 Right now ?
 I kind of got an alfresco situation going on over here .
 I want to apologize for the way I acted earlier .
 - Can you stay up near my head ?
 - Yeah , sorry . I went crazy .
 I was thinking about me , and I should 've thought of you ... - Head , Ross ! Head !
 - Right .I want you to know that I 'll be there through this whole thing .
 Doctor 's appointments , Lamaze classes , baby- proofing the apartment .
 - We can do that after we get married .
 - Married ?
 We should get married .
 Because that 's your answer to everything ?
 No , it 's the right thing to do .
 Yeah , maybe , if you 're in love .
 But we are not in love , are we ?
 No , but still , I mean , you can 't possibly do this alone .
 Excuse me ?
 Come on , you can 't even eat alone in a restaurant .
 - What ?
 - How can you have a baby by yourself ?
 - I can too eat by myself ! 
- When have you ever ?
 When certain people leave the table and I am not finished !
 Certain others take two hours to eat soup !
 Please , you inhale your food .
 I grew up with Monica .
 If you didn 't eat fast , you didn 't eat ! 
 Am I interrupting ?
 No , Dr. Long , come in . 
 This is Ross , the father .
 But not the husband , because she can do this alone .
 Nice to meet you .
 I 'll get started on this .
 - Why can 't you admit you need me ?
 - I need you to stay near my head ! 
 Okay . Everything looks good .
 Here it is on the screen . 
 There 's your uterus ... ...
 and right here is your baby .
 Oh , my God .
 Wow ! There it is , I see it .
 Congratulations .
 I 'll give you two a minute . 
 Thank you .
 Pretty amazing , huh ?
 I don 't see it !
 - What ?
 What ? 
- I can 't see it .
 - You just said you did . 
- I know , I lied .
 I didn 't want her to think I was a terrible mother .
 Come here .
 Sure you can .
 Come here .
 Look , it 's right there .
 Oh , it 's beautiful .
 I see it now . 
- Do you really ?
 - No , I don 't see it !
 Come on . All right .
 You see this tiny thing that looks like a peanut ?
 Sweetie , that 's it .
 That 's it ?
 Well , I saw that .
 - Thank you .
 - You 're welcome .
 Wow , I can 't believe that 's our baby .
 Yeah , that 's our baby .
 - So how was the doctor ? 
 - It went great . 
 - Good .
 - Show them the picture of your uterus .
 I don 't see the baby .
 I couldn 't see it either at first .
 But it 's right ...
 Ross , I lost it again .
 I saw the man in your freezer .
 You can never tell anyone .
 You bet me in a game of poker ?
 Get out . 
 There will be no kissing , and there will be no wedding .
 You ever wear your hair down ?
 Sometimes .
 Looks really good .
 Thanks .
 Are you embarrassed to be dating me ?
 If Gaby finds out , she 's gonna hit the ceiling .
 Oh , my God . You 're still in love with her .
 In a few months , I will be Mrs. Victor Lang .
 I don 't know my own strength ...
 Thank you .
 - So have you told Bree about your engagement ?
 - Yep .
 She 's on the top of a swiss alp and still managed to send a basket of muffins .
 - You 're kidding .
 - No .
 Damn things traveled 5, 000 miles , and they were still moist .
 I don 't know how she does it .
 Hey , it 's getting late .
 Let 's break out the champagne .
 Wait , wait .
 You 're not gonna embarrass me with some sappy toast , are you ?
 I 'm not , but Susan 's written a poem .
 A poem ?
 She 's reworked the lyrics to .
 Testing .
 One , two , three , testing .
 What are you waiting for ?
 Get the champagne .
 Okay .
 Thank you .
 Hey , Gaby .
 Hi , Edie !
 So I finally met Victor .
 He is so charming .
 Isn 't he great ?
 I know it 's been quick , but he 's just so amazing .
 So you really love him ?
 He is , and I 've never been happier .
 I am so thrilled for you .
 Edie , are you okay ?
 Oh , yes . Yes , I 'm -- I 'm fine .
 Oh , sweetie .
 Don 't worry . You 're gonna find someone soon .
 I just know it . What ?
 Well , actually , I have found someone .
 And I am ... crazy about him .
 Well , who is it ? 
 Oh , no . No , no .
 Tonight is about you .
 Oh , no , no , Edie .
 Come on .
 It would make me happy to know who 's making you happy .
 - Really ?
 - Yeah !
 I wanna know who 's putting that dopey grin on your face .
 Well , actually , it 'S ... Carlos .
 Who ?
 Carlos .
 I 've been seeing Carlos .
 And this is how Gabrielle Solis came to be injured the night of her engagement party .
 And though she seemed to laugh it off ,
 Gabrielle had been cut much , much deeper than anyone could see .
 Greg is definitely off the wagon . Last week ...
 That mailman was in sarah 's house over an hour .
 Packages weren 't all he 's delivering .
 I could smell the whiskey on Amy 's breath . 
 It wasn 't even noon yet . 
 Joanne may say that she was off on a religious retreat , but since when does praying make your boobs bigger ?
 What kind of woman would keep her husband 's body in the freezer ?
 For ten years ? It 's crazy .
 Has anybody talked to her ?
 I 've knocked twice .
 She 's not answering .
 Oh , I saw the curtain move .
 I think I saw a hand .
 Oh , great . Now we know she 's watching us .
 Why should we be embarrassed ?
 We 're not the ones who kept a corpsicle in the basement .
 Oh , that 's right .
 She babysat your kids .
 Oh , please , I don 't want to think of how many times she brought them ice cream from that basement .
 I mean , jeez , if you want to keep your husband on ice , at least have a dedicated freezer .
 Do you think she actually killed him ?
 Uh , yeah .
 Why else would she have hid the body ?
 Well , so far , she 's only been charged with improper disposal of a corpse .
 But once they defrost the body and do an autopsy , I guarantee you they 're gonna find a bellyful of arsenic .
 What 's arsenic ?
 It 's just -- it 's something yucky , honey .
 Go play with your balls . Go on .
 We 're trying so hard to protect them from this .
 There are just some things that kids don 't need to know about .
 Hell , there 's some things we don 't need to know about .
 Would you guys excuse me ?
 Hey , Edie !
 Oh , hi , Gaby !
 What 's up ?
 I 've been doing some thinking , and you know how ... how do I put this ?
 You know how you feel like sometimes people hate you ?
 I don 't feel like that .
 We , you should , 'cause they do . Since when ? Since you started doing things to piss people off .
 About what ? Oh , I don 't know .
 Off the top of my head ... dating your friends ' exes .
 Oh .
 Oh , so that big smile on your face the other night was all an act .
 You 're not fine with me seeing Carlos .
 Edie , there are a thousand single men in Fairview . Why do you have to date my ex- husband ? You 're engaged to somebody else !
 What do you care ? It 's awkward !
 It 's -- it 's like if I donated a dress to charity , and I went to a party , and you showed up wearing it .
 Again , if you gave it away in the first place , then what the hell are you bitching about ?
 Look , Edie , just find your own men and stop snapping up other people 's castoffs !
 And what if I don 't ?
 Then be prepared to suffer the consequences .
 Oh , please .
 You are as tall as my legs .
 What are you gonna do ?
 You 're about to find out .
 Who is it this time ?
 Um ... it 's Ian .
 You gonna talk to him ? No .
 Uh , he 's got flowers . I don 't care .
 Looks like it 's two dozen roses .
 Oh , good . I hope the thorns rip him to shreds .
 Okay , Mom , I know what Mike and Ian did was wrong , but --
 They bet me in a game of poker .
 They made decisions about my life over a hand of 5- card stud .
 " Wrong " does not even begin to cover it .
 Okay , okay , but there are only two guys in this world who know all of your flaws and have still found a way to love you .
 You 're just gonna toss 'em both away ? 
 Yes . 
 I don 't need a man .
 I don 't even need sex .
 I went without it the first 16 years ...
 22 years of my life , and I can go a few more .
 This should be interesting . 
 What ?
 Mike just walked up .
 Give it up .
 She didn 't answer the first ten times .
 She 's not gonna answer it now .
 Oh , this is getting sad .
 Take it like a brit -- stiff upper lip . 
 You know what ?
 I 've just about bloody had it with you .
 I preferred you when you were comatose and pooping in a bag !
 Well , lucky for you , I don 't have that bag right now .
 All right , that does it .
 Uh , excuse me ?
 Guys ? Hi . Um , my mom would really like for both of you to leave .
 Don 't soft- pedal it .
 Let 'em know I mean business .
 Uh , 'cause if you -- if you don 't , she 'll be very , very disappointed . 
 Rip 'em !
 So just , um ... go home and think about what you 've done .
 If you want something bitchier , do it yourself !
 Here we are -- ravioli stuffed with duck confit in a porcini cream sauce .
 What do you think ?
 I think it 's a shame you didn 't make any for yourself .
 Hi , honey .
 Hey , I just wanted to say I love you .
 Aren 't you sweet ?
 What 's that noise in the background ?
 Are the boys still up ? 
 Yeah , they don 't want to go to bed .
 Well , of course they don 'T . 
 They 're kids . You 're the dad .
 Make 'em . 
 Well , I tried , honey , but they wanna wait up for you .
 They ... they miss their mom .
 Ah , is this your way of guilting me into coming back home ?
 Lynette , the -- the restaurant did close a half- hour ago .
 Preston , don 't throw pudding ! 
 Oh , Tom ... I 'm sorry .
 I can 't come home .
 We 're , um ... doing inventory , so ... it could be a while .
 Well , okay .
 - Try to hurry ? - I will . 
 I love you . Bye .
 Inventory ?
 I know . I 'm a horrible person .
 I just chose ravioli over motherhood .
 I should -- I should go home . 
 Lynette , you got nothing to feel guilty about .
 You bust your ass in this restaurant every day to keep it going , and if anybody deserves a little downtime , it 's you .
 Those are shameless rationalizations .
 Keep them coming .
 Those , too .
 There you are .
 What are you doing outside ?
 Some big kids threw eggs at Mrs. McCluskey 's house .
 Oh , jeez .
 They shouldn 't have done that .
 We should go talk to her .
 No .
 It 's late .
 Uh , she probably doesn 't want us to bother her .
 Come on , bud .
 Bedtime .
 So here 's what 's gonna happen -- we 're not talking to Edie anymore .
 What do you mean , " we " ?
 I mean , " we " as in she betrayed me , and you 're my best friends , so you 're gonna support me because that 's what friends do .
 And " support you " means ... acting like we 're in junior high ?
 I can 't believe you 're not furious at this .
 Before she sank her fangs into Carlos , she was dating your ex- husband and Mike .
 Yes , and do you know who I blame ?
 I blame Karl and Mike .
 Why isn 't anybody mad at them ?
 I mean , let 's face it . 
 The men -- they get away with murder .
 They 're scum !
 Okay . Back to Edie ...
 I 'm not sure I 'm comfort her .
 Really ?
 Because I wasn 't very comfortable taking your side when you were feuding with Patty Monroe over the backyard fence line , but I did .
 Oh , Gaby , that 's not fair .
 Nobody really liked Patty to begin with .
 Don 't even get me started about what I 've done for you , okay ?
 I 'm still boycotting Madame Kim 's day spa because of your botched bikini wax .
 Oh , my God .
 How do you botch a bikini wax ? 
 She will show you later !
 The point is , good friends share more than just gossip and brunch . 
 They share enemies , too .
 So are you with me or not ?
 Of course we 're with you .
 We will give Edie the cold shoulder .
 No , no !
 Not cold , frozen !
 I want icicles hanging from that bitch 's ears !
 Hello ?
 Hi .
 Hey , do you still want me to look at that book report ?
 Daddy helped me yesterday .
 You weren 't home .
 Oh . Okay . 
 Daddy does everything lately .
 How come you always come home so late ?
 Well , I 'm really busy at the restaurant .
 Believe me , I come home to daddy just as soon as I can .
 You 're lying .
 What ?
 You always laugh like that when you 're telling a lie .
 why would you say that ?
 Because ... it 's true .
 I stay late because there 's a lot of work to do , and right now I 'm the only person who can do it , and now I have to go to the grocery store because I am the only person who can do that , mm- hmm .
 So why don 't you go upstairs and finish your homework ?
 Okay .
 But it is what you do .
 Excuse me !
 Uh , hey ! Excuse me . 
 That 's my space !
 Yeah , well , I 'm parked in it , so that kind of makes it my space .
 Hey , uh , I waited for that spot while the guy made three phone calls and flossed his teeth .
 You can 't just steal it .
 It 's a parking space ! 
 Keep a lid on your hormones , honey .
 God !
 You did that on purpose !
 Yeah , and I 'm about to do this on purpose , too .
 Crazy bitch !
 What do you think you 're doing ? !
 What are you doing ?
 What are you doing ? ! 
 I 'm taking my damn space !
 Get out of my car .
 Get out of my car .
 Hey , hey .
 Say you 're sorry .
 Let me go ! 
 Say it !
 Okay , okay . I 'm sorry .
 Say , " I 'm a rude , arrogant bastard who needs to treat women with courtesy and respect ! "
 I 'm a rude , arrogant ... how does the rest of it go ?
 Freeze !
 Was this man trying to steal your car ? 
 It 's my car !
 She -- she tripped me and grabbed my keys .
 Is this true , Ma 'am ?
 Oh , all right , take his side !
 Hey , who you spying on ?
 Lynette . She hasn 't returned my last two phone calls .
 I think something 's up .
 She 's probably just busy .
 Yeah , we 'll see about that .
 I am calling her right ... now .
 Oh , my God !
 What ?
 She just screened me !
 I have been screened !
 Maybe she 's in a hurry .
 No , no , no .
 This has Gabrielle Solis written all over it .
 She is turning people against me . 
 And you 're surprised ?
 I told you how she 'd react if she found out about us .
 Yeah ?
 Well , if she wants to play these schoolgirl games , fine .
 ' Cause I invented 'em .
 Lynette !
 Hi ! Hey , hey !
 I just tried calling you .
 Oh , really ? My ringer must 've been off .
 Oh , no prob .
 I wanted to invite you and the boys to Travers ' birthday party on saturday .
 Yeah , I 'm having this reptile guy , and he 's got all these cool snakes and lizards .
 The boys would love that , but unfortunately , I gotta work .
 Oh ! Well , that 's a shame , because I was hoping you could cater .
 Cater ?
 Yeah , I 'm gonna need pastas and salads for the parents and at least 20 pizzas for the kids .
 Wow , that many ?
 Yeah , and ... well , you know kids .
 If one has a pizza party , they 're all gonna want a pizza party .
 Hmm , could be good for business .
 Well , yeah , I guess I could work somethin ' out .
 Oh , I knew I could count on you ! Mm !
 Love ya !
 Look , whatever that court report says ,
 I do not have " anger issues . "
 I was just having a bad day . 
 You threatened to decapitate a man over a parking space .
 A very bad day .
 Susan , when someone loses it like you did , there 's usually a reason .
 Are things going okay at work ?
 Work is great .
 You could just sign that paper and tell the judge I 'm fine .
 What about your family ?
 Family 's terrific .
 Seriously , you 're just wasting your time here .
 How 's your love life ?
 Cancel my lunch .
 I 'm gonna be here for a while .
 Will you stop ringing that damn ...
 I 'm sorry , Parker .
 I thought you were one of those little pissants who keep ringing the bell and running away .
 So what 's on your mind ?
 I want you to come back and babysit us .
 The new sitter stinks .
 Your folks hired a new sitter ?
 Yeah , and she thinks carrot sticks are snacks .
 Well , that 's rough , but ... life 's like that sometimes .
 It doesn 't have to be .
 If you just told people what happened with your husband , everything could go back to the way it was .
 Parker , you see those women over there ?
 Nothing I could say would stop those tongues from wagging .
 I 'm sorry , kid , but ...
 I just have to wait this one out .
 Can you imagine ? !
 I mean , finding out that two men you trusted bet you in a poker game .
 I mean , how demeaning is that ? ! 
 Well , it depends on how you look at it .
 Men have been waging contests over women for centuries .
 I grant you , poker isn 't as romantic as , say , jousting , but it shows how they felt about you .
 the real question is how did you feel about them ?
 I told you -- hurt and betrayed .
 No , how did you feel about them before this poker business ?
 Well ... I was engaged to Ian , so ... obviously I loved him .
 And Mike ?
 Were you in love with him , too ?
 - How are we doing on time ?
 - Susan . Okay , fine , I loved him .
 I still love him , and I love Ian .
 So I am totally , hopelessly in love with two men .
 Now we 're getting somewhere .
 This is good .
 No , this is horrible !
 This wasn 't supposed to happen !
 I only let myself fall for Ian 'cause I thought Mike was lost to me .
 And then bang ! Suddenly he wants me back , and now I have this choice that I can 't possibly make .
 I agree . It 's tough 
 It 's devastating !
 If I go with Mike , Ian 's heart will be broken , and Ian does not deserve that .
 But how can I reject Mike after all he 's been through ?
 So you 're just gonna walk away from both of them ? 
 You have to make a choice , sweetie .
 You 've got two great guys , both of them crazy about you .
 To let one go -- well , that 's life . It happens .
 To let them both go ... that 's just ...
 Stupid ?
 Yes . That would be the clinical term .
 Sounds great . Thanks .
 Hey , how would you like to eat something that 's neither pasta nor pizza ?
 Such food exists ?
 Don 't tease me .
 No , my -- my friend Al , he 's opening a soul food place ...
 And Sunday night , he wants to test the menu with some of his chef buddies .
 He said I could bring someone . 
 And -- and -- and you want me to go with you ?
 It 'll be after we close .
 And don 't tell me that you hate southern food , 'cause then we can 't be friends .
 No , I love it .
 It 's ... it 's just that 's a little late for me , and ...
 Oh , oh , oh . Okay . 
 I- I just thought it 'd be fun .
 No , it would be , but Sunday nights are kind of crazy .
 I 'm packing lunches and checking homework ...
 Right , right .
 No worries .
 I get it .
 You 're just , uh , first person I thought of .
 You know , maybe I should go .
 Um ... it 's part of the job to check out the competition , right ?
 Yeah , absolutely .
 It never hurts to see what else is out there .
 I agree .
 Hey , guys , go check out the snakes .
 I 'll give you some pizza later , okay ?
 - See you later . - All right , I 'll see you later . 
- Hey , you want some pizza ? - Yeah .
 There you go . Lynette !
 What are you doing here ?
 Edie asked me to cater .
 I know , I 'm a total whore , but please don 't rat me out to Gaby .
 Hi , Susan !
 I have 30 copies of your book .
 The kids can 't wait for you to sign it .
 Come on , let 's go ! Come on , come on !
 Looks like we 're working the same corner .
 Yeah , only I didn 't know Edie was gonna have the party in a park .
 What if Gaby see us ?
 Trust me , we can both relax .
 I talked to her this morning , and she 's out with Victor all day .
 Oh . Well , that 's a relief .
 Go ahead .
 I dare ya .
 Hey ! what 's going on ?
 " Witch "
 - Hey , don 't do that ! - Why not ?
 - Because she 's not a witch . - How do you know ?
 ' Cause she isn 'T . Don 't be a jerk .
 What is she , your girlfriend ? Parker 's in love !
 Shut up !
 Hey , you boys ! Knock it off !
 Parker , I 'm so sorry .
 Are you all right ?
 You know , everything would be okay if you 'd tell people what you told me .
 You can make 'em stop .
 Hey , Lynette , it 's Gaby .
 Victor got pulled into some photo op at the homeless shelter . 
 So I 'm free for lunch .
 You wanna go with ?
 I tried Susan but she 's not home , which is weird because her car 's in the driveway and ... so is yours .
 Where is everybody ?
 Down ! Down ! Down !
 Aah !
 Lynette , what is wrong with you ? !
 Gaby 's coming .
 What ? ! I thought you said she was with Victor . I was wrong .
 I was wrong . Come on . Follow me .Follow me .
 Mommy , can I play ? No !
 Go ride the python !
 Come on . 
 " Rent A Reptile "
 Okay , okay , she 's circling the park .
 Ugh . I wish she 'd hurry . I 'm terrified of snakes .
 Oh , yeah , I 'm more terrified of Gaby .
 Okay , good , good .
 We 're almost home free ...
 What ?
 Don 't turn around .
 Lynette !
 Susan ! 
 Hey , Gab .
 - Hi . What are you two doing here ?
 Uh , what are we doing here ?
 Well , Edie hired me to cater , so it 's just business .
 I don 't know what her excuse is .
 You are so dead . I don 't believe it .
 This is an absolute betrayal of our friendship .
 Gaby , she asked me to make 20 pizzas . I couldn 't turn it down .
 Oh , this is so delicious .
 Is that what our friendship is worth to you -- 20 pizzas ?
 - We had a pact ! 
 - Oh , come on , Gaby , be fair .
 You put us in a really awkward position .
 - Me ? ! You two owe me an apology .
 - No , Gaby , be reasonable .
 I am leaving this party right now , and if you two don 't come with me ,
 - our friendship is over .
 - Gaby !
 Oh , come on ! - What ? ! - Oh !
 No , I mean it .
 Carlos , stop !
 Put me down ! What are you doing ? !
 Stop it !
 Carlos , put me down !
 How dare you maul me like that ! 
 You were ruining Travers ' birthday party .
 What the hell is wrong with you ? !
 I 'm sorry . Betrayal makes me a little cranky .
 Come on , Gaby , you can 't tell Susan and Lynette who they 're allowed to be friends with .
 I 'll tell you what 's ridiculous : you not having the guts to tell me you were dating Edie .
 It 's ridiculous .
 Oh , here it is .
 Yeah .I had to find out from her at my damn engagement party .
 Well , I had to hear that you were engaged to that Victor guy on the news .
 I didn 't plan it that way .
 It was spur of the moment .
 Oh , so you just said , hey , what the heck ?
 - You even in love with this guy ? 
 - Yes , deeply .
 Must be nice .
 Well , aren 't you in love with Edie ?
 We 're having fun together , but it 'll never be serious .
 So ... if I 'm just dating , and you 're in love and getting married ...
 remind me again why it is that you get to be the angry one .
 I 'm sorry , Carlos . You should be 
 Hey ! Hey .
 Feel free to take home as much cake as you want .
 I do not want to be tempted .
 I might take a little for Tom and ...
 Hi , Mrs. McCluskey .
 Would you like some cake ? 
 I didn 't come for sweets .
 I know you people have been talking about me , and I guess the only way to shut you up is to come clean .
 So ... who would like to hear the gruesome details ?
 - I would .
 - Um ... yeah . If -- if you feel like it .
  Well ... first off -- and I know this will disappoint some of you -- but I didn 't kill Gilbert .
 I came home from a weekend in Laughlin and found him in front of the TV -- dead .
 He still had the remote in his hand . Good Lord .
 It was 2 : 00 a . m . , so I decided to wait until morning to call the funeral home .
 And I went to his desk to make sure everything was in order .
 I found his pension plan ... and guess what ?
 In the event of his death , I was not the beneficiary .
 - Who was ? - His first wife .
 They were married when he started the job -- for two years .
 We were together for 34 years , and that idiot didn 't change the paperwork .
 I not only lost my Gilbert , but I was about to lose everything .
 So I , um ...
 I , um ... you put him in the freezer and kept cashing the checks .
 Well , what else was I gonna do ?
 Besides , after a while , it was kind of nice having him around .
 Anyway ... that 's the truth .
 You ladies have my permission to pass it along ... not that some of you ladies need it .
 Probably weren 't expecting to see me , huh ?
 Well , after 20 unanswered calls ... no , not really .
 About that , uh , obviously , have been very confused .
 I finally saw a therapist .
 Actually , it was sort of a court- ordered thing . Anyway ...
 Well , I need to talk to you .
 You sound ... sure .
 I am .
 I 'm gonna marry Ian .
 Believe me , this wasn 't easy , especially when you started to remember how it was between us .
 Maybe if the timing had been different ... it wasn 't .
 I 'm sorry , Mike .
 Well , at least I have my memories .
 - You ready to go ?
 - Yeah .
 Um , I told Kim that we 'd be out the rest of the evening , and she 's gonna lock up .
 - Great .
 I 'll , uh , just get my jacket . 
 - Okay .
 Hey ! You got a table for seven ? 
 - Hey ! - Hi !
 What are you doing here ?
 Well , the kids wanted to surprise you , and it 's been forever since we 've all had dinner together , so ... what -- well , how did you get here ?
 I mean , you 're not supposed to ... drive .
 I took a cab , a double- dose of the painkillers , and voilà .
 - You surprised ?
 - Yeah , a little .
 We missed you .
 Oh , I missed you , too . 
Hey , why don 't you guys go grab that big table , and I will have Rick whip something up for us ?
 Hi . Wow , you smell good .
 Oh . It must be the basil .
 It has a kind of sweet smell .
 Hey , Kayla , can you get a ... high chair for your sister , please ?
 - Yeah . - All right , who wants pizza ? Oh , hi .
 Uh , change of plans . 
 Yeah , I see .
 But ... I 'm sorry .
 You could still go .
 Oh , no . I 'll stay .
 I 'll cook for your family .
 Thanks . 
 Thanks , sweetie .
 You are taking such good care of me .
 When 's Lynette getting home ?
 Oh , as soon as she closes up the pizzeria . Mm .
 Is that guy Rick helping her ?
 He better be , for as much as we 're paying him .
 I think Lynette likes him .
 Sure .
 He 's a nice guy , hard worker .
 No , I mean , she likes him , likes him .
 What makes you say that ?
 Just something I noticed .
 Well , good night , Daddy .
 Mrs. Susan Hainsworth -- God , I love the sound of that .
 Or did you want to keep your name ?
 Because I love the sound of that , too .
 As long as I get to call you my wife .
 Deal .
 You do realize we 're gonna be blissfully happy , don 't you ?
 I mean , it could actually get a bit disgusting .
 People might throw fruit .
 Oh , I 'm gonna lock up down here .
 Why don 't you go upstairs and warm up the bed ?
 You do realize we 're gonna be great together , don 't you ?
 I know .
 Hey , Susan .  I don 't mean to bug you . 
 There 's just so much I didn 't get to say .
 Um , I ... God , I 'm lousy at good- byes .
 Anyway , you will always be the best thing that ever happened to me , and , well , I hope you find the happiness you deserve .
 Bye .
 Oh , this is Mike .
 Hey , Susan . 
 Um , I don 't mean to bug you .
 There 's just so much I didn 't get to say .
 Um , I ... God , I 'm lousy at good- byes .
 Anyway , you will always be the best thing that ever happened to me , and , well ,
 I hope you find the happiness you deserve .
 Bye .
 Oh , this is Mike .
 Where are you going ?
 Home ... to England .
 To England ?
 What 's wrong ?
 Well , it 's just , um ...
 I don 't think this is going to work . What ?
 But just ten minutes ago , we were making plans , and you were saying how great we were gonna be together .
 I , uh , saw you listening to that message from Mike .
 Well , Ian , I made my choice .
 But not for the right reasons .
 You 're just trying to honor a promise you made to me .
 That 's not true .
 I will get over him .
 You 've been trying to get over him for as long as I 've known you .
 Haven 't had much luck , have you ?
 Ian , I love you .
 I know you do .
 But you love him a little bit more , don 't you ?
 I can 't live a life where every time I see you with a faraway look ,
 I 'll wonder if you 're thinking of him .
 I 'm so sorry .
 You deserve to be happy .
 And so do I.
 Good- bye , Susan .
 Hey , Mrs. McCluskey .
 Lynette . Well , it turns out our new babysitter isn 't working out too well .
 Feel up to another tour of duty ?
 Are you sure you want the Wisteria witch looking after your kids ? 
 My kids know you 're not a witch .
 Too bad .
 I could use the leverage .
 We missed you .
 Same here .
 I 'm gonna need a raise , though .
 I 'm kinda strapped . Okay .
 I just talked to Mrs. McCluskey , and she is gonna start looking after our kids again .
 - That 's great ! - Yeah .
 ' Cause actually , I have been thinking , and ... it is time that I got back to work .
 - What ?
 - Yep . I 'm feeling good .
 I 'm gettin ' around better .
 But ... but the doctor said your recovery would take months , and it 's only been six weeks .
 Well , it 's not like I 'm gonna , you know , dead- lift a bag of ice , but I can sprinkle cheese on a pizza .
 Besides ... I hate making you run that place by yourself .
 - I don 't mind . - Really ?
 Because before , you said it was killing you .
 Yeah , well , you know , it is , but I just don 't want you to come back before you 're ready .
 You might reinjure yourself. 
 I 'll be careful . 
 The best part is we can finally get Rick off the books .
 Rick ? Why would we want to let him go ?
 Well , I know he 's been great , but , um , his salary is cutting into our profits .
 Actually , he is bringing in more than enough business to cover his salary .
 I mean , with all those new dishes he 's been cooking , he 's got a lot of fans out there .
 Does he really ? Yeah .
 I think firing him would be a huge mistake .
 Well , it 's just a thought .
 Well , don 't think so much . 
 Just rest and get better . 
 That 's what you need to do .
 You gonna be late tonight ?
 Probably .
 We got a big party coming in at 10 : 00 .
 So ... mm- hmm .
 I 'll just see you in the morning . 
 - I 'll be here .
 - Okay .
 Hi , Ida .
 What 's up ?
 That idiot postman mixed up our mail again . 
 Oh , poor Mr. Henley . He does seem to be getting worse .
 Thanks for stopping by . 
 Hey , have you heard about Mike ? 
 No .Uh , what about him ? 
 - He moved . 
 - Moved ?
 What do you mean ?
 Mona Clarke was up at 2 : 00 in the morning with acid reflux , and she saw him pack his car and everything .
 Well , that doesn 't make sense .
 Mike wouldn 't leave without saying good- bye . 
 Well , he did .
 According to Carlos , something bad happened , and Mike just wanted to get the heck out of dodge .
 It 's a pity .
 I always liked him .
 I 'd love to be Assistant Manager , but apparently , you have to flirt with Mrs. Scavo to get that job .
 He may be dating Edie , but everyone can see he 's still in love with Gaby .
 A- are you the lady who kept her husband in her freezer ?
 Yep , that 's me .
 Scary , aren 't I ?
 Welcome to the Williamsburg Diner , my name is Max 'cause the hospital wouldn 't le my mother name oops .
 I 've been out of town on summer , anything new ?
 Anything new ? Let 's see , well ...
 Facebook went public and **** pirvet .
 Kim ans Kanye had a baby , so now there 's another Kardashian to not keep up with .
 Paula Deen is out , gay marriage is in , and a teacher in California 's out for letting her students get it in .
 Justin Bieber got a hit- and- run , Chris Brown got a hit- and- run ,
 Rihanna got a hot and still didn 't run .
 Oprah gave Lindsay $2 million , cunnilingus gave Michael Douglas throat cancer , and Michael Douglas gave guys everywhere another excuse not to do that .
 Eygept went crazy , *** went crazeyer , and the NSA checks our phone like a creazy ex- girlfriend .
 Oh , and Texs hates women , *** hates blak ,
 And everybody hates everything with the exception of Angelina Jolie , who is totally awesome .
 I meant on the menu . Anything new on the menu ?
 I have no idea . Let me check .
 Hey , Caroline , anything new I should know about ?
 The royal baby smiled at the queen .
 I meant at the diner .
 I think we 're maybe washing the forks now ? Oh . Let me check .
 See , Max , one quick change , and we went from polyester and pitiful to powerful and proud .
 Just like superman .
 Except that superman changed in a phone booth , not a stall that says , " for a good time , call Max . "
 Well , if you hava problem with it , why did you write it ?
 ' Cause I didn 't have enough eyeliner to write , " for an interesting time , call Caroline . "
 Look . Look , Earl , we 're wearing our " Max 's homemade cupcakes " t- shirts again .
 See the logo ?
 Well , actually , I try never to look you ladies in the " chestal " area .
 It keeps things on the up and up .
 Oh , Earl , you are one in a million , literally ,
 ' cause 999, 999 men have only looked me in that area .
 Well , I got to go home .
 Oh , I missed so much growing up in Korea .
 What , like puberty ?
 Max , in my count I 'm avere height .
 And in my mind , I 'm still rich , anmy health care plan isn 't flintstones chewables .
 So who wants to go in the back and see how amazing our brand- new cupcake shop is ?
 Bring down the enthusiasm , rachael ray .
 Right , we 're not supposed to get all excited out this opening tonight .
 Last time , we made a big deal , and the shop didn 't do so well .
 That 's like saying the people near the nuclear explosion didn 't do so well .
 Ha !
 Girls , I am so proud of you two , getting back up on that horse .
 After my first jazz record didn 't sell ,
 I turned to a life of drinks , drugs , and loose women .
 Funny how sometimes things just work out right .
 But how can you be opening your cupcake window right now ?
 It 's 2 : 00 A. M. our hours are 2 : 00 to 4 : 00 .
 We 're targeting the " post bars " demographic .
 Drunk williamsburg guys .
 That 's my target when I 'm by myself and now my target at the new shop .
 Funny how sometimes things just work out right .
 We have no big expectations about the opening tonight .
 It 's a soft opening .
 What 's the difference between a soft one and a hard one ?
 You want me to show him ?
 Thanks , but we 're cool .
 Seriously , it won 't take me a minute .
 It 's fine , Oleg .
 Just so you know , I 'm already there .
 Get ready , this room 's had an amazing transformation .
 - Rachael ray ? - I mean , it 's fine , whatever .
 Han , before we go in , close your eyes .
 I want you to get the full effect .
 Yeah , and I want to trip you .
 - She 's kidding . - No , she 's not .
 Yeah , I 'm not .
 Han , I promise , I won 't let her trip you .
 Now , close your eyes .
 - What ?
 - Now , I thought she was going to hit me .
 - She was not . - Yeah , I was .
 Okay , no more blind eye bull crap .
 Just show me the damn smelly back room .
 Let me turn off the lights for a more dramatic impact .
 What ? I didn 't do anything .
 It was me .
 He now knows what hard is .
 I cannot believe my eyes .
 I felt the same way when I first saw you .
 Original tan , original tile , original too .
 What do you think , Oleg ?
 Nice .
 " Nice " ? All you got is " nice ? "
 This place was like Great Adventure for rats !
 They were waiting in line to bite us .
 Caroline , show them your bite marks .
 - I 'd rather Not . - Nice ?
 It used to smell like the place poop comes to die .
 Or death comes to poop .
 And look what we did !
 We created the grtest , coolest , chic- est cupcake shop , and I love it !
 But you know , no ehusiasm . Just aoft opening .
 And , han , this was all possible because you gave us the space rent- free .
 Rent- free ? Now , refre my memory .
 When exactly did I say " rent- free ? "
 On the 27th , 4 : 15 P. M. , you said ,
 " I don 't care about that dump , you can have it for free .
 Burn it to the grod , for all I care . "
 I knew learning English would come back to bite me in the ass .
 Soone 's already knocking ? That 's a really great sign , Max .
 Time to open .
 Look , girls , I 'm blowing this party horn for you .
 Thanks , soie , but we didt wanto make a big deal , it 's a soft opening .
 Oh , I love a soft opening .
 - Hello , Sophie . - Oh , hello , leg .
 Sorry , shie , about this uncomfortabl meeting .
 If ww had known you were going to suprise us ,
 - we weouldn 't have invited Oleg .
 - Yeah , I was there when you two broke up and I 'm still suffering from PTSD .
 " Post- traumatic Sophie drama . "
 There 's no drama .
 And the ard for the best drama goes to .
 Not us . Right , Oleg ?
 Yes , we 're friends now .
 See , girls , I cheated on her , so she smashed in my car windows .
 And my apartment wdows .
 And your streo and your flat screen .
 And my brother 's flat screen and his daughter 's computer .
 Ye , she surprised me . She wasn 't suppose to be home .
 We got it out of our sysms . Good night , friend .
 Good night , friend and , Oleg ?
 Wow .
 That is one lucky horn .
 Honey , ook . Look , some customers .
 Hey , cool guys !

 One summer I had a part- time job , I was a life guars at a crack hous . *** he 's dead .
 Called that wrong .
 Max , the guy who died in front of our shop last night was a rock star .
 He used to date Kate moss .
 No offense , but dating Kate moss is like a law in england .
 Everyone has to do it when they turn 21 .
 His name was Roland Glass , and he has two gold records .
 I can 't believe I 've never heard of him .
 I can .

 I 'thinking .
 Caroline -
 Max , I 'm
 Well , no one 's knock , knock , ocking on our door now .
 ' S more deadut tre than when ere was a dead guy out the .
 I 'm having second thoughts about how behav today .
 I mean , how could we have let hanive ?
 Hello .
 I brought you some rock star pudding to sayhankou .
 Oh , rock star pudding . What 's in it , pills ?
 Oken dreams ? Tear- stained panties ?
 Caroline ?
 I 'm Noas easy as Max .
 Said every gir my seventh grade class .
 Look , I was wrong .
 No , han , I was .
 We should pay rent .
 I wasn 't talking about the rent .
 Rent ? [ Muffled ] O said anything about rent ?
 I was wrong when I said it wast personal , it was business .
 After Max stopped me from being torn
 limb from limb by the smelly hippies ,
 I realized , with us , it is mostly personal .
 And a little business .
 A little business ?
 What other kind could you have ?
 Max , let 's not be hard on han .
 He 's giving us this space rent- free .
 No one said " rent- free . "
 I came up with a number I think is fair . $250, 000 .
 Yeah , sounds fair .
 I remembered that was your original cupcake shop goal .
 So when you hit that amount , we can talk rent .
 Han , that is so sweet .
 And I 'm not gonna ruin it by bringing up the fact that she just said " hard on han . "
 Really , han , it 's so , so generous .
 But don 't know if we 're comfortable with it what if we offered y a small piece of theusiness ?
 I 'll wait for thrent . You two are good fends .
 A woman finally offers han a piece , and he turns it down .
 Max . Google alert .
 Oprah 's topless ?
 Max , let that go . That 's never gonna happen .
 Not with that attitude .
 No , the autopsy says roland glass choked on a Max 's homemade cupcake .
 This is a disaster .
 Hey , where 's your enthusiasm now , miss rachael ray ?
 This place is the balls !
 And it 's just a matter of time till those sicko hipsters are lining up for " one of those cupcakes that killed that dude " open the window !
 We 're back , baby !
 But we can 't count on a guy dying every week .
 I mean , I have a positive attitude , but that 's too
 We don 't have to .
 That 's what 's so great about this window .
 Who knows what 'll happen ?
 Right , and we won 't have to chase business down because we 'll be right here on the street waiting for it to come to us .
 Max , I feel so good about the possibilities .
 One night it could be a black American express card , and the ...
 Max , is it ...
 Other nights , it 's a friendly little visit from our homeless guy .
  Previously on " The Originals "
 This town was my home once , and in my absence ,
 Marcel has gotten everything that I ever wanted .
 I want it back .
 I hereby pledge my allegiance to you .
 You have the keys to my kingdom .
 You 're choosing him over me , aren 't you , again ?
 The only reward anyone ever gets from loving Niklaus is suffering and death .
 Niklaus , the girl is carrying your child .
 You 're coming with me , little wolf .
 I 've been deemed under protection by the almighty Klaus .
 I believe it is time for my niece Cami to leave town .
 Leave New Orleans . Forget everything .
 Do I know you ?
 You 've been compelled .
 It 's ok . I can fix you .
 For centuries , people have come to New Orleans
 looking for a fresh start , hoping to find fortune , adventure , even love , young society women imported from France with the promise of marrying a proper New Orleans gentleman ,
 Like the legendary Casket Girls .
 Little did they know that the men who awaited them were far from proper and not at all gentle .
 Get them out . We want to see the women .
 Come out . Come out here .
 Come on . We want the women .
 Oh , there , there , little lambs .
 All the bad men have gone away .
 Us girls have got to stick together .
 Now , is there anything you want to take with you ?
 The Casket Girls ' legend lives on , now celebrated in typical New Orleans fashion with stylish costumes and supernatural flair .
 It 's a yearly reminder of how women can be oppressed by selfish men and how they can triumph when brave enough to fight for themselves .
 Oh , god , it hurts !
 I 'm sorry , Cami .
 It 's the only way to break all of Klaus ' compulsion .
 Believe me , I know what it 's like .
 You 're ok , and , hey , all these notes that you made ,
 It 's very " memento " of you .
 Nice work .
 We 've been at this all night .
 I don 't understand what 's happening to me .
 I don 't understand any of this .
 But you will .
 I will unlock every stolen memory , undo every piece of mind control that any vampire has ever done to you .
 When I am done , you will understand all of it , and you 'll be free .
 I can stop if you want me to .
 No . Don 't stop .
 I want to remember everything .
 Would you like some help ?
 You might need to use all your vampire strength .
 Allow me .
 Thanks .
 Not too many pregnant Casket Girls , I guess .
 I think you look lovely , only I would ...
 I know , keep the freaky werewolf birthmark covered .
 Well , I don 't suspect any of the riffraff here would dare lay a hand on you knowing that you 're under the protection of my family .
 Still , we shouldn 't take any chances .
 All knocked up and nowhere to go .
 You know ...
 If you wanted to attend the festivities tonight ,
 I 'd be more than willing to take you .
 You and Klaus are barely on speaking terms .
 Let 's not rock the boat , ok ?
 Of course .
 Elijah ...
 Do you mind ?
 Not at all .
 Dull , dreary , hideous .
 Talking about the clothes or something else ?
 Why , feeling insecure ?
 This festival might as well be in my honor .
 I need a proper costume , so bugger off .
 - Bekah ... - Don 't .
 You made your choice .
 You and Klaus are best friends again .
 You 've relinquished your right to touch me .
 Wonder who that could be .
 What 's up ?
 Bit of an issue .
 Seems our little bird has flown the coop .
 You should start to feel it , like a weight lifting .
 And your cheat sheets are about to make a lot more sense .
 I promise , as soon as the world stops hunting me ,
 I will find the daylight ring spell .
 I know . Just don 't worry about that right now .
 I remember why I wrote this .
 I found a picture of
 Klaus and Marcel from 1919 .
 Klaus compelled me to go out with Marcel to spy on him .
 That 's what he said yesterday before he told me to forget .
 I 'm remembering .
 Let 's take you back more .
 Leave New Orleans . Forget me .
 Your brother was ill .
 There 's no reason to stay .
 You don 't have to be Sherlock Holmes to know the obvious .
 Our secret weapon has escaped .
 She wouldn 't just leave .
 She knows the witches want her back .
 Her violin is missing .
 She may have left of her own volition .
 What did you say to her in the attic ?
 She lied to my face so she could stay up there thinking that you 'd help her control her magic .
 How do we know that you didn 't take her ?
 I have no idea where Davina is or why she ran away .
 Can I suggest you take a step back ?
 I can assure you , I have absolutely no desire to see that child come into harm 's way .
 She 's suffered enough with this harvest ritual nonsense .
 That child to whom you refer so affectionately is the most powerful witch in New Orleans .
 If she 's fled , what 's to stop her from destroying us , in fact , destroying all we 've worked for ?
 No . If she 's not a friend to this family , then she is our enemy .
 She is a friend , Klaus .
 Well , let 's hope so .
 Lucky for you , I know how to get her back .
 Follow my lead .
 You know how Niklaus operates .
 If he perceives a threat , he can become quite ruthless .
 This would not bode well for Davina .
 I 'm not gonna let anybody lay a finger on her .
 Nor will I.
 So the witch is missing , huh ?
 Walked right out the front door , apparently .
 Know anything about it ?
 No , although I did tell her that the witch elders were dead .
 Well , why would she care when the witches tried to kill her in their ritual ?
 I think it was more that Marcel didn 't tell her that the one thing preventing her from being free had been eliminated .
 So you are the reason she 's run off .
 Hey , I was just telling her the truth .
 She 's the one who realized they were just using her to keep their control over the witches .
 Well , I 've never been a fan of the boys club .
 Just wait .
 Elijah will join them , and the three of them will be impossible .
 Used by the witches , lied to by Marcel , manipulated by Elijah , threatened by Klaus ...
 She 's like a modern- day casket girl .
 Are you talking about Davina or yourself ?
 Does it matter ?
 Either way , us girls have got to stick together .
 Sorry to interrupt .
 Been calling you for like an hour .
 I thought you 'd have taken the hint .
 You 've been acting like this since Agnes was killed .
 Yeah . Can you blame me ?
 It 's not like I have a lot to keep me going these days .
 Well , while you 've been drowning your sorrows by nailing everything that walks ,
 I 've been doing my tours , keeping my head down my ears open .
 Marcel 's daywalkers are scouring the whole town
 looking for a girl -- brown hair , blue eyes .
 Sound familiar ?
 If Davina is not with Marcel , he won 't know if we 're practicing magic .
 And if we can actually get her back , we can fix everything .
 Sun goes down , vampire search parties quadruple .
 I got this from her family 's old house .
 Feel like a locator spell ?
 Keep drinking .
 You need the vervain in your system so you can 't be compelled again .
 Hey , Cami , you don 't have any human blood in your fridge , do you ?
 For crying out loud , here .
 Davina ?
 Someone is practicing magic .
 They 're trying to find me .
 Then we have to run .
 There is no way to sneak me out of the quarter .
 By now , everyone is looking for me --
 The witches , Marcel , Klaus .
 My uncle will know what to do .
 - Cami ... - I mean , he has to know somewhat of
 - what 's going on in this town , right ... - Cami , stop .
 Unless he 's been compelled .
 He knows .
 What are you talking about ?
 He knows .
 He works with Marcel .
 They 're practically friends .
 I hear them talk .
 He knows everything .
 No .
 He would 've told me if he knew the witches put a hex on my brother .
 He knows ?
 Cami ...
 Oh , my god .
 He knows .
 Hey , you guys seriously need to go , like now --
 Plane , train , automobile , whatever .
 Take my car . It 's parked down at the docks .
 I 'll text you the where .
 Put your number in Cami 's phone .
 Most of the quarter is shut down right now .
 We 'll have to walk , and the sun is taking forever to go down .
 Hey , no tears .
 Promise you 'll meet us as soon as it gets dark out .
 Yeah , but don 't worry about me .
 Just don 't let them find you .
 I know Klaus told you to follow me , but does it really mean you have to follow me to the bathroom ?
 Just give me two minutes .
 It 's my gynecologist .
 What the hell do you want ?
 I know you don 't trust me , but you need to listen .
 Everything is about to change .
 Davina is on the loose .
 Figured that out on your own , huh ?
 Remind me again why I should give a damn .
 I need something from you so that the witches can complete the harvest .
 On what planet would I help you witches get more power ?
 All you 've done is hex me left and right .
 You 'll help me because if we don 't complete the harvest , our access to magic will fade for good , which doesn 't bode well for your family .
 What do you know about my family ?
 You 're from the crescent wolf bloodline .
 Marcel forced a witch to curse them so they 'd be trapped in wolf form .
 And I should keep listening to you because --
 Because my bloodline executed that curse .
 Help me complete the harvest , and I 'll undo the curse for you .
 But what can I do ?
 I need to consecrate the remains of a powerful witch so I can absorb their magic .
 I know of one whose body was never found .
 Her name is Celeste Dubois .
 I believe you and she have a friend in common .
 Elijah .
 Story goes that when she died , he buried her in a secret spot at her request .
 All you need to do is find out where .
 There 's people everywhere .
 Just keep walking . No one knows it 's you .
 Cami ...
 We have to get off this street .
 Kieran is gonna call me first if he hears anything .
 Ah , you two look rather cozy .
 Hardly . I was just telling Elijah how we 're wasting time .
 You don 't like festivals ?
 I don 't see why not ?
 Who doesn 't love a street fair ?
 Sister , come to help us find our stray ?
 We can 't let your secret weapon get in the wrong hands , can we ?
 For the record , we are moments away from retrieving her .
 Recognize that tone of voice , Niklaus .
 Clearly , you have some diabolical machination .
 What is it ?
 Timothy ...
 Might I have a word ?
 Cami , hey , it 's me ... again ... Stalking you .
 Just really need to know where you guys are so I can meet you before the sun comes up ... Again .
 Uh , hello ?
 Joshua , my most disappointing minion ,
 I suspected you wouldn 't answer the call were it from me .
 Klaus , hey , what up ?
 Guess what . I just moved to Turkey .
 Weirdly , they don 't eat turkey here .
 - Go figure . - You 're lying .
 In fact , Marcel and I were just chatting about your failed double agent status , and we 've surmised that you 're likely still in town and in the company of a friend --
 A young , angry witch .
 Nope . Nope . No witches here .
 Totally digging turkey , though .
 Are you really gonna leave Davina 's fiddler soulmate Timothy alone with me ?
 Oh , Josh , what would she think of that ?
 I assure you , I just want to talk to her .
 Tim and I will be at the compound .
 I really do hope she comes home soon .
 We should keep moving . How long do we have to wait ?
 Give it a few minutes .
 Then I 'll check to see if the coast is clear .
 Josh , sorry I missed your calls .
 What ?
 I didn 't want to tell you , but I know Klaus .
 If Davina doesn 't show up , he 'll kill Tim .
 We 'll think of something .
 Make your way to the quarter . Stay hidden .
 We 'll text you when we have a plan .
 - I have to go . - Davina , wait .
 I can 't let Tim die .
 What 's wrong ?
 The witches .
 No !
 Cami ?
 I 'm just grabbing some clothes .
 Give me two minutes , please .
 Celeste entrances me .
 She is perfection .
 She is dead .
 Even as the sun rises , I see only night .
 But for the promise I made to her that in death , I would bury her far from the mayhem of witches , vampires , and men .
 I 'm so sorry , Elijah .
 Hey . It 's just me . Don 't , like , melt me .
 What are you doing ?
 You 're supposed to be hidden .
 Yeah .
 So are you , remember , but you 're kind of working that whole " girl on a mission " Look that makes me nervous .
 Are you sure that you really want to mess with the baddest dude in all of history ?
 He messed with me when he took Tim .
 I 'll kill him , all of them .
 Davina , originals can 't be killed .
 Maybe they can .
 I have so much power ,
 I 've never felt anything like it before .
 It 's growing , gathering inside me .
 I 'm strong , Josh .
 If you kill them , then --
 What ?
 If you 're gonna do it , don 't hold back .
 You hit them with all you got .
 That was very sweet , not telling Davina that if she kills Klaus ,
 You die , too , very noble .
 Problem is , she goes after my brother , she 'll be the one who ends up dead ,
 A very unnecessary end to an already- tragic story .
 Perhaps you 'd like to help me help her .
 Where 's Rebekah gotten off to ?
 It 's not Rebekah that I 'm concerned about , and how are you be so certain that Davina will come ?
 One might think you 've forgotten what it 's like to be in the grip of an all- consuming infatuation .
 She 'll come .
 Are the maudlin theatrics absolutely necessary , Niklaus ?
 Ha ! It 's a fair point ,
 Timothy , play something a little more upbeat , please .
 That 's a good lad .
 Took you long enough to spread the word .
 Have you met his nightwalkers ?
 Not the brightest assortment .
 All that matters is , I got it covered .
 When Davina gets here , you two need to let me do the talking .
 Well , I 'm sure you 'll have your chance .
 Hello , luv .
 Silence is golden , Timothy . Thank you .
 Davina ?
 You got me here . Now let him down .
 Well , first , we have to have a little chat about you returning to the fold .
 What did I say , Klaus ?
 I got this . D. , what happened ?
 Why 'd you run ? Talk to me .
 Hey , I can make it right .
 How , by threatening my friend ?
 Actually , that was my idea . Apologies .
 I 've been known to go too far to make a point ,
 But I do always get results .
 You pretend to be so confident , but I know the truth .
 you 're afraid everyone can see what you really are -- an animal ...
 a beast .
 Why don 't you show us your real face ?
 That 's enough of you .
 Davina , you don 't have to do this .
 You --
 You looked me in the eyes and lied to my face , pretended you wanted to help me .
 Listen to me .
 You call yourself the noble one , but you 're a killer just like your brother .
 For 1, 000 years , you fed on innocent blood .
 Why don 't you choke on it ?
 And you --
 I trusted you .
 I loved you , but you were just using me to stay in power .
 You don 't care about me .
 You 're wrong .
 When you lost to Klaus , you handed me over like some trophy .
 Maybe I should boil you in bronze .
 I care .
 I took you in like you were my own blood .
 Come on now , luv .
 Don 't tell me you were falling for that .
 Isn 't it time for us girls to have a chat ?
 Now , that is impressive , and well- deserved , in my opinion .
 Now , before you turn on me ,
 I have a surprise for you .
 Josh , what are you doing ? Get out of here .
 What are you doing ?
 Now , if I were Klaus , I would rip
 Josh 's head from his neck , feed it to a nightwalker , and that would be the end of your friend ...
 But hurting people is such a boyish thing to do ,
 like how Klaus compelled your fiddler on the roof , and , while I am many things , I 'm certainly not my brother .
 It 's ok , Timothy . You can come down .
 No one is gonna hurt you .
 He told me I couldn 't climb down off this beam .
 Then don 't climb , silly .
 Am I the only smart one in the room ? Jump .
 Davina , how did you do all that ?
 How did I even get here ?
 I 'll explain everything , I promise .
 Why are you doing this ?
 Seems to me that you 're the one holding all the cards , but you don 't know who to trust .
 I 've just proven that you can trust me .
 Now I 'd like to show you one more thing .
 Won 't take long .
 You can bring your friends .
 Oh , Sophie , I told you everything that I found .
 You said he buried her between two lovely oak saplings .
 News flash -- that was 200 years ago .
 They 're all just trees now .
 You want to be the all- powerful witch , keep looking .
 Say a prayer . Have a little faith .
 You can do this .
 Ok .
 Please , please help me .
 I 'm trying to do the right thing .
 Oh , don 't worry .
 They 're not really dead , just really hungry , and I 'm not helping .
 You think my brother Nik is awful ?
 Marcel learned from the best .
 This is how he treats his so- called friends who betray him .
 Most of what these poor souls did is no worse than what Josh did .
 Take Thierry , for example .
 He was Marcel 's most trusted friend .
 Klaus tricked him into breaking one of Marcel 's rules .
 Marcel knows this , and yet he keeps Thierry
 locked in here day after day suffering .
 This is insane .
 Why are you telling me this ?
 Because you need to know who you 're dealing with , who you can trust .
 Hey , hey , it 's gonna be ok .
 I mean , you 're gonna be all right .
 Here . Drink something .
 Davina , both you and I have been lied to and taken advantage of by Marcel and Klaus .
 Maybe together , we can get a little payback .
 Uh , guys ?
 Tim ?
 It was Klaus . He made me do it .
 I didn 't even know what I was doing until I made you --
 Made her what ?
 Drink .
 Tim ?
 Klaus poisoned the water .
 Tim ?
 Davina ?
 Oh , no .
 Cami , are you all right ?
 Did you eat today ?
 Oh , you must have fainted .
 Yeah , or I got mystically cold cocked by 3 witches .
 Where 's Davina ?
 Does your friend Marcel know she 's here ?
 Cami , I can explain .
 Vampires ? Witches ?
 My brother , your nephew , hexed by a witch .
 How could you not tell me ?
 It 's complicated .
 There 's a lot you don 't understand .
 You hid the truth from me .
 You let me believe that Sean was crazy , that I was crazy , instead of telling me the truth .
 I was protecting you .
 You saw what happened to Sean .
 Cami , please --
 Get the hell away from me .
 You are every bit as bad as the other monsters in this city .
 Oh , isn 't this monumentally awkward .
 Rebekah , where are you ?
 I 'm with Davina , and she 's dying because of your treachery .
 Well , I tried to talk to her out of respect for Marcel , but she made it quite clear she is not our friend .
 My apologies is you thought she was yours .
 Just tell me how to cure her .
 Vampire blood isn 't working .
 No . It wouldn 't .
 You see , the poison I compelled Timothy to feed her is quite potent .
 It 's just a matter of time for her .
 For both of them , you diabolical bastard .
 They 're children .
 We could 've dealt with her fairly .
 There is no dealing with those who threaten us .
 Davina sealed her fate when she stood against me .
 This was her choice , not mine .
 Oh , come on .
 The stench of your judgment is overwhelming .
 Need I remind you that Davina just bested the lot of us ?
 I did what had to be done .
 Don 't worry , Elijah . I remain as redeemable as ever .
 So you compelled that boy to poison Davina without consulting Marcel or myself .
 You know what the worst part is ?
 Is that you 're so predictable ,
 I had to make an alliance with your brother , who I don 't even like .
 Judging by your expression , you have something you 'd like to share .
 Damn straight , I do .
 I got a call from Kieran earlier , right after Sabine and some witches almost got their hands on Davina first .
 Oh , hello .
 Let me guess , protection spell ?
 You think I 'd let a day where witches can do magic pass by without one ?
 They all should 've done the same .
 You broke one of my rules , Sabine , and I 'm guessing that spell of yours is probably a one- time deal .
 I 'll give you two choices -- an immediate reunion with your dearly departed friends or you can do that same spell for a young witch friend of mine .
 Yeah . You probably know which one I 'm talking about .
 So when you slipped away to allegedly check on your nightwalkers , you were , in fact , colluding with a witch .
 That 's very clever .
 I suppose I should be proud .
 Eh , I just wanted to make sure
 I had a failsafe just in case , as Elijah expected , you started acting like you .
 Except that now you 've involved the witches , who , last time I checked , were enemy to us all , to everything we have , and to our family .
 Davina is Marcel 's family , Niklaus , or did that somehow slip your mind as you tried to take her life ?
 You will call Rebekah .
 You 'll tell her that Davina will recover .
 Do wish the same could be said for that boy .
 Tim .
 Tim ? Tim ?
 Tim , Tim , wake up . Tim , please wake up .
 Open your eyes . No , no .
 Please wake up .
 Please don 't leave me alone .
 Is she ok ?
 She 's devastated and exhausted .
 Where 's her room ?
 No . I got her .
 I got her .
 It is said that this is a man 's world , and sometimes it is .
 For every Casket girl that was saved , countless others were not ...
 She 'll never trust me again .
 Perhaps .
 You must never surrender the fight to reclaim that trust .
 But women are more resilient than given credit for ...
 These drawings , what are they ?
 She drew those the whole time she was in the attic , said they 're different than what she draws when she senses magic .
 These ones , she called them evil .
 And some women , well ,
 let 's just say , their oppressors had better watch out .
 Surprised to see me ?
 After all , you did compel me to leave town .
 You remember .
 Chalk one up for decompulsion .
 Hurts like hell , but it 's worth it ,
 Made me realize exactly why I want to stick around ,
 Oh , and , Klaus , if you hurt Davina or Josh in any way , I 'll expose you to the world , and then you can kiss the french quarter good- bye forever .
 Have a nice night .
 I , too , am resilient , and I 'm tired of being oppressed .
 For 1, 000 years , my brother has taken what he wants in whatever way he wants , regardless of the consequences .
 Marcel seems determined to allow it , and Elijah stands right by his side futilely awaiting the day that he 'll change .
 So men suck .
 What do you want me to do about it ?
 Despite your dire warnings to Marcel , he just can 't seem to quit my brother .
 The two of them stand side by side ruling this city whilst you 're left in here to rot .
 I want you to help me take New Orleans right out from under all of their noses , and I have something they won 't see coming , someone on the inside .
 She 's quite the resilient girl herself .
 You ok ?
 I 'm better now .
 How was your day ?
 Killer .
 What 's with the artwork ?
 Davina 's sketches .
 I wonder if they represent some kind of premonition .
 They seem to suggest something is coming ...
 Something sinister .
 Oh , my god , isn 't that --
 Hello , Celeste .
 Come on , Sophie . Pick up . Pick up .
 My brothers and I are the first vampires .
 In all of history ... The Originals .
 300 years ago , we helped build New Orleans .
 Now we 've returned to find a city at war .
 The vampire Marcel leads an army against a coven of desperate witches .
 My brother Klaus is playing against both sides , hungry for power and hoping to protect the werewolf carrying his child , but Marcel has an advantage .
 He holds our brother Elijah captive with the aid of a secret weapon .
 Now in order to get back the brother I love ,
 I have no choice but to side with the one I cannot trust .
 August 1359 .
 I have noticed a difference in my siblings .
 Our bond strains beneath the pressure of our life as vampires .
 Each day removes them further from the humanity they once possessed .
 My sweet sister Rebekah has grown quite indifferent to brutality .
 However , the true problem remains by brother Niklaus .
 He continues to hide his loneliness with cruelty .
 Still , I cling to the hope that I , as their eldest brother , can lead them down the correct path , a path charged with the power of a family united ...
 For if I fail , our family 's legacy will end in darkness .
 I cannot believe you disposed of those vampires without me .
 You know how I love to set things on fire .
 Was I supposed to leave them in the front yard to rot ?
 Besides , they were my responsibility .
 They attacked the helpless , pregnant girl who 's carrying my child .
 Oh , I am so moved by your newfound sense of fatherly duty towards the werewolf carrying your hybrid bun in her oven .
 Ha !
 The werewolf would like to know what the plan is .
 Well , that depends what plan you mean , luv ...
 My plan for global domination or Rebekah 's plan to find love in a cruel , cruel world .
 The plan to rescue Elijah , you know ...
 The good brother , the one who is now in the possession of your mortal enemy after you stabbed him in the back .
 In the front , if we 're being specific .
 You two said that you would get him back .
 So is there a plan , or what ?
 Ok .
 Well , firstly , Marcel is not my mortal enemy .
 He 's my friend , albeit one who is unaware that I am trying to sabotage his hold over the supernatural community of the French quarter , but a friend nonetheless ,
 and secondly , I daggered Elijah in order to gain Marcel 's trust .
 If I had known he would place my brother in the hands of a particularly nasty teenage witch ,
 I certainly would have weighed my options a bit differently , and thirdly , sister , please .
 And thirdly , the plan , as you have demanded , is for Niklaus to simply asks Marcel for Elijah back .
 That 's not the whole plan , is it ?
 Oh , please .
 Klaus may be a miserable excuse for a sibling , but there is none more diabolical .
 That 's only the plan " a , " luv .
 There 's always a plan " B. "
 And what 's plan " B " ?
 Damn , I do look good in a suit .
 Joshua Rosen , 18 , had recently arrived in New Orleans as part of ...
 My guy and the docks is gonna come forward as an eyewitness , say he saw those two drunkenly fall into the Mississippi .
 They 'll be dredging for weeks .
 No one will come looking around here .
 That 's good , considering one is dead in a dumpster behind the county morgue and the other one is a vampire now .
 Anything else ?
 Allow me , darling .
 One thing .
 I sent 4 nightwalkers to look into a werewolf sighting in the quarter .
 I haven 't heard from them since .
 That makes 10 dead nightwalkers in the last week .
 You think the werewolves are back in town trying to start some trouble ?
 Look . I know you and Klaus are friends , but the fact is , since the Originals showed up ...
 Oh , come now , Thierry .
 You 're not still upset about that little , toxic werewolf bite I gave you , are you ?
 I thought we were at by
 I see you 've given him free rein of your compound now , too . Yes .
 Well , seeing as my family and I
 lived here , built the place , in fact ...
 All right . Come on .
 You both know the drill .
 Thierry is my guy , inner circle .
 Klaus is my old- time friend and sire .
 He 's also a guest here .
 Peace , all right ? All right ?
 What you need , my brother ?
 I 'm afraid my sister Rebekah is insisting I demand Elijah 's return .
 She 's quite worked up about it .
 I 'll say .
 We 're not gonna have 3 Originals walking around town , are we ?
 Half our guys think the sister killed the nightwalkers .
 Is that an accusation against an original ?
 What did I say about peace ?
 Come on .
 Walk with me .
 Your inner circle man lacks a sense of humor .
 He 's a little overprotective , but loyal to a fault .
 I saved his life back in the forties , found him dying of a war wound outside a VA hospital .
 He 'd kill for me and die for me .
 Plus , that boy can play the trumpet like you would not believe .
 Maybe I 'll see if he can play a little tonight at the party .
 You 're coming , right ?
 How can I miss my chance to meet the city councilman as he accepts your gigantic charitable donation ?
 Oh , he 's a schmuck , but he lets us do our thing in exchange for certain community services ,
 like keeping our fangs out of the locals .
 Listen . About your brother ,
 I would love to help you out , but Thierry is right .
 My guys are on edge .
 They see the original family moving in , vampires dying , it makes them nervous .
 If I hand Elijah back now , it might give the wrong impression about who 's really in charge here .
 You know what I mean ?
 You understand I had to ask .
 Hey , Klaus , for the love of Mary Magdalene , how long does it take to ask a simple question ?
 Much longer than you 'd think , considering the answer was , as expected , no .
 Marcel 's man Thierry is suspicious .
 He thinks you killed 10 nightwalkers .
 Well , that 's a lie . I only killed 8 .
 Should I make Thierry the ninth ?
 Marcel is playing friendly .
 We can 't kill the favorite son , or he 'll catch onto us .
 So war it is , then . Indeed .
 Do you know what to do with the witch ?
 I believe I do . Good .
 You manage Sophie Deveraux .
 I 'll take care of the next step .
 I ordered you to drain him of blood .
 What 's taking so long ?
 Sorry . I 'm not medieval torture expert guy .
 What did he do to you , anyway ?
 It 's not about what he did .
 It 's about what he 's going to do when we 're done here , which is whatever I want him to , just like you .
 For example , drive this through his torso .
 That is crazy .
 I didn 't want to do it , but I did it , anyway .
 It 's called mind compulsion .
 Vampires can compel humans .
 Originals like my siblings and I can also compel vampires , and no one can compel Originals .
 You following ? Good .
 That is how a brand- new nightwalker such as yourself is here doing my bidding with no one the wiser .
 But I never had my guts drained out of me . Yes .
 That , young Joshua , is because I got to you before you had even a drop of herbal vervain in your system .
 You see , it prevents compulsion .
 Marcel has had his whole crew taking it since I returned to town , 
 and that is why our friend here needs to be bled dry of it so I can compel him to follow my every command , 
 and with my brother currently in captivity awaiting rescue , 
 we can 't afford to be gentle about it .
 Come here . Yah !
 Oh , so glad you could make it .
 Elijah only lies daggered and rotting whilst you dillydally .
 You 're lucky I came at all .
 What do you want ?
 Hayley was attacked last night by Marcel 's crew because somebody told him there was a werewolf in the quarter .
 She only made one stop .
 Whoever saw her here ratted her out .
 Watch and learn .
 Hey , Soph . Hey , Katie .
 That 's filled with marigold , great for attracting the opposite sex , would look awesome on you .
 I very seriously doubt that .
 Do you have any others , one with , say ...
 I don 't know ... Wolfsbane , perhaps ?
 Wolfsbane ? Why would you want that ?
 Please do not play dumb with me .
 Rebekah !
 I just sold the werewolf some herbs . That 's all .
 Are you lying to me , Katie ?
 I suggest you answer my question honestly .
 Just answer the question , Katie , please .
 Yes .
 I told someone , but you don 't understand . I ...
 I love him .
 Then tell me , who is this vampire Romeo of yours ?
 Shall I count to 3 ?
 Be quick about it .
 I have an army to build , and one compelled minion does not an army make .
 Well ?
 You were right about the traitor .
 Luckily , she 's just a kid and she doesn 't know anything about us and what we 're up to .
 Do you want to hear the part that 's gonna please you the most ?
 Oh , do tell .
 She 's in love with someone in Marcel 's inner circle .
 Guess who it is .
 Right- hand- man type , favors silly caps ?
 Two points for you .
 Thierry is fraternizing with the enemy .
 Well , that means he just unwittingly became the key to our entire plan .
 I told you you 'd be pleased .
 Oh , to be young and in love in a city where witches and vampires are at war .
 How very tragic .
 Are you out of your mind ?
 No way . It 's very simple .
 We need you to perform a teeny , tiny locator spell to help us find our brother .
 Witches who practice magic in this town get caught , and they get killed .
 Yes .
 About that , it seems you left out a crucial detail when we made our deal ...
 Marcel 's secret weapon , the way he knows when a witch is using magic .
 Girl about yay high , cute as a button , anger issues .
 Davina ?
 Where have you seen her ?
 I don 't know .
 The little brat erased my memory right after she threw me out a window with her bloody mind .
 Let me cut to the chase .
 Davina has Elijah .
 You witches , I assume , want to get Davina away from Marcel .
 We don 't know where she is .
 Ergo , we need magic .
 Davina would sense it .
 Unless , of course , another witch ...
 Say , a traitor to the cause ,
 Katie , for example ...
 Was to perform much more powerful magic at the same time .
 That would create a smokescreen concealing your very small spell from Davina .
 Katie doesn 't deserve to die .
 Sophie Deveraux ...
 You 're in no position to be so principled .
 You can 't win a war without a few strategic losses , no matter how regrettable they may be .
 How many times have the vampires been one step ahead , known something they shouldn 't ,
 your sister executed in the public square for practicing magic who knew she 'd be caught ?
 Did she even attempt to flee ?
 She was caught hiding in a cargo hold of a freighter before it set sail down the Mississippi .
 And who , pray tell , in Marcel 's valued inner circle manages his business at the docks ?
 Katie 's boyfriend Thierry .
 You 're right . He 's good .
 Right ? Music man I call him .
 Ladies love him , but he 's spoken for .
 He knocks around with this pretty , little witch , says he loves her , but I don 't know .
 Yo brightest soldier is fraternizing with your enemy , and you don 't care .
 Well , of course I care , but Thierry is a grown man .
 He makes his own choices , and I get some good intel .
 Besides , he 's not gonna do anything to jeopardize what we 're doing here .
 I mean , check this out , a vampire hosting a ritzy charity event .
 We have a community here . No one is gonna mess that up .
 Still ...
 You don 't want the witches to get too bold , given that a witch 's tip about a werewolf in town
 led to the disappearance of your nightwalkers .
 I 'm sure you 've considered the possibility that it could 've been a trap .
 Maybe I 'll send a little message .
 Thierry ...
 Take a team of nightwalkers to the cauldron tonight , do a little rousting ...
 Oh , and , Thierry , make it nasty .
 And so with that , I moved back here to be closer to my brothers because ... let 's face it ...
 Family is important , right , Camille ?
 Cami . I have to change this name tag .
 Drunk guys keep hitting on me in French .
 You sure you haven 't been in here before ?
 Your face looks so familiar .
 You must have seen me out and about .
 Aren 't you dating Marcel Gerard ?
 He 's a pal of mine ... Sort of .
 I heard he had a crush on the blond bartender at Rousseau 's .
 I would hardly call it dating .
 He 's wooing me ... Sort of .
 I don 't know .
 He 's very charming , which probably means
 I should run for the hills .
 I 'm kind of in an on- again/ off- again thing myself at the moment .
 Those are the worst , aren 't they , 
 the ones you can 't shake , even though you know better , and you always know better ?
 I like you , Cami .
 Most girls have the unfortunate tendency of being whiny , little twits .
 Thanks ... I think .
 Hey , I 'm supposed to go to this posh charity thing thrown by this philanthropist tonight .
 He 's a bit of a Gatsby , throws a mean party .
 Any interest ?
 Little sister .
 Well , brother , I believe I 've made certain
 Marcel will be properly distracted tonight .
 Dare I ask ?
 Let 's just say his attention will not be on us .
 I did my bit .
 What are you doing to ensure Elijah 's safe return ?
 Currently , I 'm preparing insurance against the tender- hearted .
 Meaning ?
 We need proper motivation for Katie to cast a powerful spell tonight .
 I 'm creating that motivation .
 Marcel has ordered a rousting of the witches .
 No !
 I , in turn , have arranged for things to go tragically wrong .
 You understand what you 're to do ?
 Good .
 What 's happening out there ?
 Oh , it 's Klaus .
 He 's convinced Marcel that the witches are planning to make a move against him .
 Marcel wants us to send a message , and if he thought I was playing favorites just because I 'm in love with a witch ...
 Say that again .
 I love you , Katie , and all this is gonna be ok , promise .
 Marcel may not be concerned with Thierry 's romantic entanglements ...
 I already got that one .
 But there are other crimes which he 'll be
 less inclined to so easily forgive ...
 Aah ! Thierry !
 Aah ! Leave her alone . Get off .
 Killing a vampire , for example .
 That would be unforgivable .
 If Katie hopes to save her one true love from Marcel 's punishment , well , a rescue mission
 like that will require something positively magical , but then ...
 What 's worth dying for if not love ?
 Well , this certainly is a fitting backdrop for tonight 's events , I must say .
 Hey What 's she doing here ?
 What better way to distract Marcel than to put his very human , new girl in a room chock full of vampires ?
 Hello , darling . You look precious .
 This party is ridiculous , but I think I could get to enjoy this place .
 Is he the infamous on- again/ off- again ?
 He 's the brother , actually , and my sister is right .
 You do look stunning .
 You clean up pretty well yourself .
 Well , don 't be fooled , luv .
 I 'm the devil in disguise .
 You two chitchat . I need booze .
 Shall we ?
 Ok .
 Scotch , please .
 You trying to be cute inviting her here ?
 I think she 's darling .
 I can tell you fancy her pure heart .
 Perhaps I 'll feed it to you .
 Hmm , jealousy looks good on you , Bekah .
 The guy of hers Rebekah was talking about ...
 I 'm sensing that would be Marcel .
 I wouldn 't worry about it .
 Ancient history .
 I 'm beginning to think your sister is a bit of a bitch .
 It 's as though she invented the term .
 Listen .
 Pardon me for a moment .
 Cami .
 Hey , killer party .
 Oh , it 's more of a work thing .
 I would 've invited you ...
 Oh , no . We 've been on one date .
 No explanation necessary .
 You do your thing . I 'll entertain myself .
 What , leave you alone ,
 looking the way you do ?
 Hell with that .
 You 're not supposed to be out here .
 Who are you ?
 Sorry . I didn 't mean to scare you .
 I 'm Sabine . We met .
 I 'm one of Sophie 's friends .
 You 're one of the witches .
 Sophie just asked me to come keep you company while everyone is out .
 You know , it 's drawn to you .
 The child you 're carrying is part vampire , part werewolf .
 You and Klaus made something special .
 You sound like Elijah .
 He thinks this baby is gonna make us one big , happy family , but now he 's gone , 
 and I don 't even know what ...
 It is .
 You know , I can do something about that if you want ,
 I mean , find out if it 's a boy or girl .
 I thought you couldn 't do witchy stuff around here .
 It 's not magic , just an old trick my grandmother taught me .
 Come on .
 You have to be a little curious .
 I thought you said you were in community work .
 Community fundraising .
 Throw a party , folks open their wallets .
 It 's kind of my thing .
 Guess I 'm what you call a necessary evil .
 And Rebekah , she 's one of your donors ?
 She 's an old friend .
 Can 't be that old .
 She looks younger than me .
 You 'd be surprised .
 I was a kid when I met her .
 Enough about her .
 I just want to be right here with you .
 You really are a hideously evil little thing , aren 't you ?
 Nonsense . They 're perfect for each other .
 You wanted Marcel distracted .
 My cue to leave .
 Excuse me .
 What the hell did you do ?
 Not here .
 No , not here . 
 I know you think he 's a monster .
 It doesn 't matter what I think .
 Thierry killed another vampire .
 He broke Marcel 's biggest rule .
 You 'll never see him again ...
 Unless we do something .
 " We " ?
 I want to save our people .
 You want to save Thierry ?
 There 's only one way we can do both .
 You ready ?
 Marcel . Something is coming .
 Magic .
 I want to hear your side of it .
 Hey , Marcel , come on .
 Your version . Go .
 We were tossing the cauldron .
 This guy , some nightwalker , he attacked Katie for no reason .
 His name was Max . I turned him .
 As far as reasons go , he doesn 't need one .
 She was a witch . He was a vampire .
 Now he 's dead .
 I didn 't mean for it to happen .
 You broke my most important rule .
 Damn it , T. How long we been friends , 70 years ?
 Yeah .
 I turned you into something that would never die .
 I gave you a gift .
 And I have been loyal to you all this time , and I still am .
 I 'm still your friend , Marcel .
 I swear , that hasn 't changed .
 You were right , luv .
 He 's got a temper , doesn 't he ?
 I guess this is the moment I remember I know better .
 We found this at his girl 's place .
 Still my friend , huh ?
 That 's funny because it looks to me
 like that little witch of yours got her hands on a spell that I keep locked away .
 Marcel , I have never seen that .
 Shut up .
 I see on your hand , you still have the daylight ring I gave you .
 So what would you need with the recipe for making new ones unless maybe you and Katie were gonna go off and start a little kingdom of your own ?
 Marcel , no .
 Here 's a lesson in friendship .
 Friends don 't lie to me , they don 't break my rules , and they do not steal what is mine .
 For the crime of murdering one of his own ,
 I sentence Thierry Vanchure to 100 years in the garden .
 And it begins .
 You 're doing the right thing .
 It 's the only way to find Elijah .
 I 'm doing what I have to do .
 Katie , no !
 Like clockwork .
 Hurry .
 No !
 You 're here to save your man .
 Well , come on , little girl .
 Die , you son of a bitch .
 No ! Katie !
 Something is wrong .
 Katie 's magic stopped .
 I can keep going .
 You can 't . She 'll sense it .
 No . I can find Davina . I just need another moment .
 You may be willing to die to get your witch back , but Hayley and the baby will die with you .
 Elijah will never forgive us , and rescuing him will be for nothing .
 It 's over . We failed .
 No . Katie . No , no , no , no .
 No .
 Just tell me this .
 Was she worth it ?
 I loved her .
 Seal him up and let him rot .
 How much did Cami see ?
 She just saw an argument , mate .
 It 's nothing you can 't fix .
 You really like her , don 't you ?
 I like that she 's not a part of any of this .
 Sometimes it 's good to see the world the way the humans do .
 I am sorry about Thierry , you know ?
 I can tell he was a good friend .
 I made him what he was .
 Obviously , my trust was misplaced .
 Doesn 't make it easier .
 You saved me tonight . I guess I owe you one .
 You asked for your brother back .
 Seems like the least I can do .
 Cami ...
 Don 't even try it .
 I get the bro code .
 You 're here to smooth things over for your friend .
 It 's very nice of you , but ...
 But you 've been hurt before , and you aren 't taking any more chances .
 Something like that .
 The guy I saw tonight , not the guy I thought he was , and if he can turn on a dime like that ...
 Sounds like more than just a broken heart .
 Someone broke your trust ...
 Camille , the brave bartender .
 I 'm sorry ...
 But I need you to give Marcel another chance .
 Wow . I totally misread that .
 You read it quite well , but we all have our roles to play .
 You went to Marcel 's . You danced .
 You feel badly hat he had a row with his friend , but otherwise , all you remember is that it was perfect .
 Well , tonight was an epic failure .
 On the contrary , sister .
 Tonight was a masterpiece .
 Are you mad ?
 Katie died before Sophie could complete the spell .
 Oh , I 'm well aware . I killed Katie .
 You what ?
 There 's no way our little suicide witch wasn 't gonna try and take out
 Marcel with her .
 I saved his life , and in doing so ,
 I now have him exactly where I want him .
 Sophie trusted you .
 I trusted you against all my better instincts .
 Wake up , Rebekah .
 The witches are on no one 's side but their own .
 This girl Davina , that 's all they want , and when they have her , what do you think happens then , a truce ?
 Of course not .
 They will use Davina 's power against all of us .
 Even if you 're right , the plan was to find Elijah , and you failed us .
 You always did lack faith .
 By protecting Marcel , I 've cemented his trust , so much so that he 's agreed to return Elijah to us , and when the time is right , when he has told me everything
 I need to know about Davina ,
 I will have her for myself .
 I have all the faith in the world that you 'll get what you want , Nik .
 You always do , no matter what it costs the rest of us .
 You disgust me .
 Are you ok ? I was so worried .
 Thank you .
 Whatever you did , I felt it .
 You helped me .
 It was the old ones , wasn 't it ?
 Actually , Klaus is the one that saved me tonight .
 I 'm gonna make things right , starting off by giving him his brother back .
 No .
 What ?
 Davina ...
 No .
 You said the old ones were dangerous .
 I won 't give him back until I know how to kill them .
 I thought you might like to know ,
 Elijah is returning to us .
 Congratulations .
 I guess being diabolical has its perks .
 You hardly know him , and yet you miss him .
 What is it about my brother that always inspires such instant admiration ?
 He was kind to me .
 There are moments when I doubt if my family is capable of redemption ...
 Hey , I learned something today .
 I think it 's a girl .
 Elijah , voice- over yet each time that I am tempted to surrender , I see it , the glimmer of goodness that allows me to believe .
 You 're following me .
 Maybe you 're just in my way .
 I told you no good would come from this unholy alliance of yours .
 At least I 'm doing something .
 What about you ?
 Sabine , tell them what you saw .
 It 's the girl , the wolf .
 I think it 's a girl .
 No .
 Wait .
 Wait what ?
 Please tell me I 'm not having a mini Klaus .
