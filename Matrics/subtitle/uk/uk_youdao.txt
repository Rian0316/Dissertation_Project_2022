There's a waiter under the building.
Tell him to wait, Mrs Hudson
He is always in a hurry
Slowly slowly
I must apologize
I'm a little bit overworked
I'm a doctor and I'm going to ask you to relax until you've eaten something
Xie xie
If I could have a cookie and a glass of milk
I'm sure it'll be all right soon
Mrs Hudson is cooking now
Please forgive me for my weakness
I really have to.
Mr Holmes
For your effect Lao Art master
Ph.D.
The headmaster of an Abbey school
It's not every day Dr. Hackstabb
Famous fugitives like you lie on the carpet in front of my hearth
I'd like to guess what brings you here
I took the liberty of searching you in the hope that you would forgive me
Oh, yes, yes, of course
Please have a seat
You watch
It's been at least 30 years and it's been scratched this morning
When you unthinkingly shoved those hard coins into your pocket
Immutable habits are left behind
It may be a small thing but I think it looks like a quivering needle from a certain Angle
I may also show you a tremor in your stubble to show that your daily habits have been heavily influenced
Is it three days already?
Yes, Mr.
Yes, Sir, Mr Holmes, I beg you to follow me north to Maccleston at once
matters
Oh I'm sorry
Mr. Watson and I are extremely busy at the moment
I have my hands full with the Ferrer papers
And Dr. Watson told me that the recent outbreak of scarlet fever has kept him off the ground
And of course there's the Abel Caveney murder trial coming up
Now it's only ten big questions that can keep us away
"Significant," Mr.?
Did you say "heavy"?
Surely you have heard of Lord Hudnith?
The former cabinet minister?
It's not just that, Watson.
His head titles almost took up half of the alphabet
One of the king's greatest subjects hi, Dr. Hakestabb?
The greatest is also one of the richest
I am proud to say that he is still my neighbour
Hudnaith House -- his great country house was just across the river valley from the convent
The Duke was a very solitary man
He was afraid that the public would ask questions about it, but he was so anxious that he saw that it would be settled that he offered five thousand pounds and another thousand pounds in the hope that the bad man would be caught in the net
That's how big it is
That's a lot of money for Dr. Hackstabb
But you haven't talked about the case yet
Oh, please forgive me
The Duke's only son, Lord Saltell, has been kidnapped!
Tied up in a convent school?
Is the
Under your watch?
Was the harness born three days ago?
Last Saturday night
Then why did you wait so long to find me?
The Duke was always afraid that his family's bad fortune would be made public
The Duke asked the police to act with caution - as they did.
- I'm clear
It was a very unseemly affair
I also feel that I have been somewhat improper in admitting it
By what means was the ransom money raised?
There was no offer of redemption
There's no redemption money?
Didn't have
This is one of the most puzzling aspects of the whole thing because this boy didn't walk out on his own
Mr. Heidegger our German teacher is missing too
And by the way, his cart is gone, too
If he was the one who bound the boy, why has he not yet received any ransom claims?
Heidegger came from Switzerland with the best recommendation
Are there any other vehicles missing?
Oh no
Are you sure?
Yes, Mr. Evelyn checked all the bikes
Dr. Hakstabb are you saying that the German teacher rode away on her bicycle in the middle of the night with this boy in her arms?
Don't
What do you have to say about that?
A single car may be just a mask
He may have hidden the car somewhere and then the two of them walked away
No doubt he could have hidden a few wagons if he had wanted to make that impression
I think so
Of course he could, Dr. Hackstabb your whole "cover-up" thing doesn't hold water
But that's for the investigation
It's a good start Watson, will you send for a carriage immediately?
Now, Holmes?
Pick up and pack in each position
We still have plenty of time to catch the night train from Sympancras
Dr. Hackstabb I'm going to your place to do some research
There might still be some clues that an old hound like Watson and I could sniff out
I suppose it would be a great honour for you to have Sir Saltell at your school?
Mr Holmes, it was published after Blackwell
The proudest moment I've had since Hakstabb's View of Horace, which was a great success at the time
You may have heard of it
Didn't have
How old is the boy?
Nine,
How long have you been studying there?
As soon as the winter school season began, school came
A boy who is not in the right place seems right
He, uh...
What's the matter?
All I'm saying is he's not very happy at home
The duke's marriage was not an easy one
His marriage last year ended in separation after mutual agreement
The Duchess returned to Venice to live in her father's mansion
How do you know all this about the duke's marriage?
Is it something everyone knows?
I have had several private conversations with Mr Wilder who is the Duke's secretary
He's very helpful
I assume you have established that the boy did not go to Italy to return to his mother?
Oh yes
Yes, I can't tell you... Mr. Holmes... -i feel so relieved...
- China life? !
- is coming! -Here are the starters
Mrs Hudson, how did you guess?
Experience, Mr Holmes
Uh, doc and Doc can eat as much as they want in the car
The air in the wilderness is so invigorating that I may find myself having a better stomach for a few days
I think it would be appropriate for me to say that monasteries are the first preparatory school in England
Lord Levaststock, Earl of Blackwater cathcart. Sir Soames
Send their children to me
You can't see Hudnaith House from here, but you can see it clearly from the tower of the chapel
I'm gonna start with the boys 'room
Is it from his dad?
He was lost when the morning came
Has he received any letters from Italy?
Have not been recently
Where is the letter from his father now?
I can't find it
The boy should have been on his body when he was strapped
Who lives in a compartment?
- - No, you don't have to arrest - - I dare say I've solved this kind of family
Even if it is lightning thunder can also shout shout big sleep
He won't
Is it true? Why?
There was an old rat born in the wall
Woke us both up
Old rat?
So any sound from Lord Saltel's room...
Uh, the door creaked first
We can always hear the door
Did you hear anything when he disappeared the night before?
There is no Mr.
You can't even hear a cry
Cry cry?
Yes, Mr.
He sometimes cries
There is time to wait for the first
Thank you kids
Didn't you find anything on the ground?
Did not find
The traces are all gone
The school long!
The school long!
Lord Hudness is here headmaster
Thank you, Mr. Evelyn
Mr Holmes?
well
The Duke is waiting for Mr Holmes
It's useless to say this one
The duke of adults
Mr. Wilder
I called you yesterday Dr. Hackstabb
But it's too late to stop you from leaving for London
The Duke was surprised to find Dr. Haakstubb
I can't believe you invited Mr. Holmes to investigate without first consulting your lordship
Well, I think the police are out of their depth.
The police should be... absolutely right is not powerless
Yes, but Mr. Wilder...
You must have noticed how anxious Lord Dr. Hackstabb was to avoid public scandal
He hoped that as few people knew about it as possible
I'm sorry, Mr. Wilder
The matter is easily remedied
Mr Holmes could catch an early train back to London
No, no, no, no
I love the way you feel in the air
I reckon I'll spend at least a few days in your wilderness
Who knows if there's nothing else maybe we'll find Mr. Heidegger's bike
This is no small matter, Mr Holmes
I'm glad you don't think so
Mr Holmes if you mean anything
I'm afraid I didn't hear you clearly
Your only son is missing
Your hope that you have not come to your high family are facing the threat of disillusionment
What do you think is...?
I would like to know your son's sexual life or his name
What does prudence count for?
But is also allowed to answer the case is not the continuation of the glory can count what?
But I believe you are right to a great extent, Mr Holmes
If you're referring to my efforts to limit the actions of the police, then I may have put too much influence on them
I have a sickly fear of public relations
James if Mr Holmes is here we'd be fools not to ask for his help
Mr Holmes?
The big man?
Perhaps you would like to come and live with us at Hudness House?
Thank you, Sir, but I think it would be wiser for the investigation to keep me at the scene of the case
You casually
Either Mr. Wilder or I will provide you with the assistance you need
May I ask if you have your own views on the mysterious disappearance of your son?
No, no, no, no
He's a good boy, Mr Holmes
How long has he been in your class?
Since the day he got here
Did he talk a lot about his family?
Don't often talk
I think he feels a little resentful about his mother and the way his father acted
Did he ever talk about the separation of the duke and his husband?
Didn't have
There's some mystery to this
The boy insisted that they loved each other very much
Don't you see that he's trying to comfort himself?
No, he's a very old, solid kid
Oh, but his family is not very old
Someone told me they were members of the Hellfire Club.
I don't suppose you know what time Mr. Heidegger returned to his room on the night of his disappearance?
No, it's not too late
After eleven o 'clock
He was the duty teacher that night
I think he can ride a bike, right?
Yes, oh, yes
Did Lord Saltell ride with him?
No, he hasn't learned how to balance
I don't suppose you happen to know the brand of Mr. Heidegger's bicycle tires?
Of course know
A lovely bike from Brightman
The tires are Palmer you know the ones with the stripes
I know that
Xie xie
You've been a great help
You're welcome, Mr Holmes.
Dinner is served at eight o 'clock
I'm sorry
Holmes?
I've grown to like this case, Watson
There are certain points of interest in this case
Look at this map
Some of the characteristics of the soil are closely related to our investigation
This black square is the convent School
This is a main road with no turnouts for a mile on either side
The ground potential on the north side of the school rises slowly
To the south is a large ploughed field with many high walls and hedgerows
It's impossible for a driver to pass
Oh, what did you find in Oakburn?
Police received reports from various parts of the area that a man was seen with a boy
This morning we wrapped up a survey of the area
Is there any fruit?
nothing
The reported characteristics of the elephant did not kiss the boy nor the German teacher
great
The number of false eyewitness reports and Watson confirms my suspicions
I don't think they went far enough
It must be right to seek solitude
I don't think they went that far
But a single car?
A good driver is a Watson who doesn't need a good road
The wilderness is divided into patches by small tracks
I remember it was a full moon
The man we're looking for is to the north
You did the right thing, Watson
You'll be delighted to hear that dinner will be served soon but there's one more thing I need to clear up
Mr. Heidegger's room
Just ten minutes
Dr. Holmes is working on the origins of the Hudnais family
Like many families of old, they don't have a very clean history
Not clean, doctor?
Well, they're just cattle rustlers without a degree of sensitivity
Brave, wise, resourceful, and bold, it is impossible for them to make their first fortune from other people's cattle
Holmes even told me that Hudnaith was once named a mad member of the Hellfire Club
What's wrong with you, Dr. Hackstabb?
There's nothing
Obviously there is something wrong
I think my expectations were too high
It's a part-time job after all
Tell me what you want
I'm not looking for anything weird
I don't think I'm a person who wants to find something strange... but you haven't found anything
We haven't found anything since we left London
This is not true, though
Well, you found out about both of those things
One is a dirty word and the other is a false and slandering image of my great client's family
Mr Holmes I did not hire you here to bring the name of the Hudnaith family into disrepute
Keep it cool and quiet
As a matter of fact, we have already found out
I can give you a detailed account of what passed on that fateful night at the school
And what your wonderful and loyal German teacher did
Was Heidegger loyal?
What are you talking about?
Mr. Heidegger retired to his room shortly after eleven
He is a late day teacher
Now my friend and colleague Dr. Watson will simulate his actions
Heidegger was on duty for another two hours that night and another hard day
He decided to let himself loose and took off his jacket
Then he went to the counter by the door and poured himself a glass of sherry
He occasionally needs a drink to meet his duties
He took his candle and sat down at the table to review his work, which included not only grammar but also a long composition
You know what I'm gonna say, Dr. Hackstabb
If he's not doing anything else
His candle should be snuffed out just after noon and night
The candle was in the cupboard by the door
He got up from the table and reached for another candle, but it was black and he could not find it
So he went to the window and drew the curtain aside to see more clearly by the moonlight
On the roof of the tower opposite the gate the boy was waiting for the moon to come pale and he knew that no one would see him flee
Mr. Heidegger watched as the boy hurried over the ridge to the river for his appointment
He felt the importance of what was unfolding
Heidegger ran for the door and knocked over the rest of his sherry glass
I've learned
Xie xie
It seems that I was wrong about you
It was not wise of him to chase after a boy
I don't think he's alive or dead
I beg your pardon, Mr Holmes
You mean...
I hope it is not so, but if it be the truth of my reasoning that I am truly concerned for him
What about the child?
Bosch is the thread of this affair
Is out in the
It's on the other side of the Zhuofu Bridge
Pity the beast
The raven
They've given up their reputation by pretending that the boy was taken away on horseback, haven't they?
Don't wrong
Otherwise Heidegger wouldn't need a bike to chase him
But all we found were cow tracks, Holmes
Holmes? Holmes?
A car rut hua Sheng!
A rut
Is it a single train?
Of course it is a single car is not the single car
I am familiar with 42 different single wheel tread tracks
This is a Dunlop with a patched outer tire
Heidegger had Palmer tires
These aren't Heidegger's ruts. Whose are they?
Whose is it at the end?
China!!
These are palmer's wheels that mark heidegger's path
This is so unusual
The ruts of the Dunlop stretched 150 yards
And the wheel marks of palmer's plate were clearly directed towards these rocks, but they had disappeared
And there's no sign of a horse anywhere
Watson, your ability to see the obvious is remarkable
I should have brought some lunch
What exactly is Mr. Heidegger riding after
The cows?
They can't strap boys to the back of cows
All traces of the horses were wiped out
It was easy to see that the two vehicles just flew away
Can't be
Just because we made a mistake can't be
So in one respect we should be wrong
At the other end of the wilderness there was a sign of the inn
Holmes had a hotel on the chesterfield road
Yes, if we follow this route we'll go to the hotel
Uh, I thought I'd get some luck in there
I'm hungry
Holmes?
Lunch is a dear friend you should be starving to death
I'm looking at the map now
You'll see a hotel about three miles from here
We need some if we're going to face Lord Hudnaith again
Didn't you get anything?
If I find nothing, I must tell the great man
No takers?
nothing
I'm sorry
I'm sorry
locked
These forged pictures are rough but full of vividness
Mr. Ruben Hayes?
How do you know my name?
It's right on the door
We're looking for something to eat
Is it?
We'd be thrilled if you could find us something to eat
Is it?
Is the
You'll have to ask that woman
An annoying family member
If we have to make it all the way back to Hudness House this afternoon
Then hire some horses
How do you feel?
How far are you going to ride them?
Go to the Duke's house and come back I say you know the way?
I worked there for 15 years
Well, you can ride them
I said Mr. Hayes did you hurt yourself?
It doesn't matter
I'm a doctor and I assure you it's not gonna be easy
You should see a doctor about it
How did you get hurt?
One of my dogs did it
Those are scratches
What's the matter?
Well, a closer look shows how far apart they are
What kind of animal could create a scratch like that?
Maybe a descendant of champion Jack.
The law has banned chicken fighting for 50 years
The law forbids many things
What law is there in a land like this?
Oh, that's great, Mrs. Hayes. Thank you
What are you cooking?
Blood pudding, sugar and grain
Well, Watson?
Disgusting holmes
That woman... why is she more scared than her husband
Then two in a row three deceit
What do you want to hide?
Deceives tricked?
Oh, Watson
My horse is lame
It's strange
The horseshoe is old, but the nail is new
Gentlemen.
The big man is here to see you
Oh, Mr. Wilder
Mr Holmes, Dr Watson, welcome to Hudness House
He'll be right there on his horse
We have high hopes for your talents, Mr Holmes
Did you bring anything with you?
There's just one thing I need to clear up
What is it, Mr Holmes?
This concerns the duke's grave concerns
I might be able to help you as a great man's secret
I think the elder man wrote a letter to his son right after the accident
No, it wasn't the day before it happened
It is true that the letter comes when the day comes
Yeah, it could be
Was there anything in the letter that would encourage the boy to run away?
Oh, I don't think so
He was running back to this place anyway
Or to his mother in Italy?
No, Sir
Even if the German had instigated him Lord Saltel would have realized
That's impossible. He's a sensible, down-to-earth boy
But he would cry in his sleep
Are letters sent by adults themselves? People are not used to sending letters
The letter was lying on the desk with the others and I had put it there myself
The only other person who had access to the mail was Reeves who delivered the daily mail to the mailroom
Are you sure the letter was in there?
Oh yes
I noticed what did you find, Mr Holmes?
How's your research going?
Are you trying to disappoint me?
I wish I could make people more open and I could be a little richer
So what did you find out?
The Lord has some questions to clarify
I think a prior covenant lured a boy out of school and I suspect his mother was used as bait
The German teacher spotted him leaving and went out in pursuit
It was with great difficulty that we found his single wheel rut in the wilderness
It's like all the traces... have been erased by someone.
Mr Holmes?
Someone who drives a herd of cattle
Do you know the herd of cattle in the wilderness.
What happened to the cows?
I hope you haven't seen the cows
The weather on our high land is not suitable for cattle grazing in winter
They had to wait at least two weeks before they could leave the barn
Then I'm really blind
Thank you for your honor
Old shoe, new shoe!
Old shoe, new shoe!
Holmes, you should see this!
Of really let a person imprint elephant deep engrave! Nail the horse with a hoof-print that covers your ears!
Have you seen the horseshoes?
I saw the men who took Lord Saltell pin different horseshoes to their horses to avoid being tracked
Reuben Hayes draws on a piece of local history
Oh, no, Watson, no
The north vulture points to the square
German teacher
Look what's left of his body!
You are good!
You are good! You are good!
The skin and blood
Only a microscope can tell if it is not humanoid
This is definitely consistent with the scratch marks on Hayes 'neck
Oh yes, what was the cause of death?
Le kill
His throat was shattered
The shepherd will take us to the convent to tell us of this unfortunate news
We must advance on foot, Watson
When I was one step away!
Like a kid trying to figure out a puzzle in that bar!
But every step I take, MY back goes off the line
How do I know where to put the body?!
It's over, Arthur
Ruben Hayes
I hope we're not too late
There are patches on the outer tire of the Dunlop
What's going on here, Mrs. Hayes?
I'm glad you don't like the idea of coercion
Someone picked up the boy
Mr Wilder, the Duke's secretary?
Which way did they go?
Cross the wilderness?
To their hideout on chesterfield Road
Excellent, Mrs. Hayes
I must marry A warlord's son
You are now the angel of the male child
I saw the big man's ticket on the table
I'd be delighted if you could write me a note for ￡6,000
It would have been better if you had drawn a line across it.
The Oxford Street Branch of urban-rural Bank is my agent
It is not in my nature, Mr Holmes, not to appreciate such a tart joke even though it clearly pleases you
I'm sorry but I don't understand that James is Mr. Wilder
How could you get involved in this and you have no proof of it
But I have the evidence in my hand and it is ironclad
The mud is still wet from the horseshoes in your display cabinet
Why do you doubt what I say?
You seem to have smeared it
Your gain will be destroyed by your foolish wisdom
There are pictures of you and your father in his youth in the great hall
All have obvious family characteristics
How long has Mr. Wilder worked for you?
What do you mean by that?
How dare you!
You don't know!
You are a rude man!
You will never... please get off the horse!
I won't.
I....
Then my suspicions were right
Mr. James Wilder is your son
When I was very young, Mr Holmes
I fell in love with that kind of love for once in my life
I proposed to the lady and she turned me down on the grounds that such an alliance would ruin my business
I'm sure I wouldn't marry anyone else if she were still alive until she's gone
There was only one child left James for whom I nursed and nurtured
I cannot openly acknowledge our paternity, but I still treat him as my own son in any other way
He pleaded with me several times, but he could not get his testimony, and I forgave him
To forgive
Too many times
Oh, my Lord has done his best with Mr. Wilder
You must realize that he was not impressed by your words
He plotted to kidnap Lord Saltell
No talk is so many mistakes without a heart
He is always a conspirator and must be found! Before he plans to commit more serious crimes
He must be found! Before you lose your last son
Reeves?
You organize a search of the wilderness
Along the west side of the forest from the temple courtyard to the pavilion
Call every man in the house and not one of them will be left behind
You find my son Lord Saltell
If you find Mr. Wilder please hold him and bring him back to me
Wilder intercepted your letter and wrote another note and replaced it to fool your son into believing that he would meet his mother
Hayes was his paid accomplice but the police have been notified
Hayes can't get away with it
China life?
I followed them to the wilderness but they didn't see me
I've searched the whole area but they look like they've been swallowed
I looked into your family history
I seem to have mentioned a huge limestone cave for the storage of stolen cattle
The cathedral!
Quick point!
Come on!
Hand him over to me
No! You're not gonna get him!
- the father kisses! - Come on, father!
Father kisses!
Father kisses!
James!
My love for Francesca is not a boyish passion but a man's love
My marriage to her provoked jealousy from James
I could see his mother's face and lift on his body
James knew he could stop me from loving my wife
In spite of his cruelty to Arthur
I can't kick him out just yet
So I sent Arthur away instead
What did he hope to achieve by tying up his brother?
Money?
The ground position of the law?
There is power
I have power over me
He was flattered that he could ride over me and he knew that I had refused to give him power
But did you ever suspect that he was the master of the harness?
I have thought of it in my darkest hour
Somehow I hoped I could save him
Well, it's like a long, long redemption
My only hope is that Francesca will forgive me
Thank you, Mr Holmes
Big man..
This is a ransom for the king.
You gave me back my absence
Bohemian scandal
Got you!
Look at it.
It's a man!
Go close the window. J, O, H, N
Sherlock Holmes always addressed her as "the woman." He vaguely remembered the beautiful Irene. Adler
At the beginning of the Irene Adler case
Holmes and I have shared Baker Street for some years
I went out of the country for medical treatment and stayed a few days before I came back
Usually some time after leaving Holmes
I have to get used to his weird spleen
Oh!
Oh, hello, Mrs Hudson
Dr Watson, you are almost wet through in your state!
Yeah, it's not a big deal
I was waiting for a cart to stand full time in the rain for 20 minutes
That's not good for your old wound
I know that
Give me your coat and hat and I'll dry them for you
Mrs Hudson I haven't eaten all day
It would be nice if we could get dinner here quickly
I don't know. I wonder what happened to Mr. Holmes. It's like he's on gun poison
I can't bring dinner until he calls me
It was his order
Thank you, Mrs Hudson
My dear Holmes
What was it injected tonight? Is coffee or cocaine?
I can strongly recommend to you 7 % cocaine solution
Would you like to try it on?
I won't try!
I'm here to speak not just as a friend but as a doctor
How can you destroy your gift of excelling others with a quick feeling? !
I can't tell you how it brightens my brain
That's right, but it also destroys your brain!
My brain will turn upside down if I have nothing to do
Give me a difficult problem to do for me to do the deepest secret code to do the most complex analysis work for me to feel the most comfortable
I don't need to be prodded
I have often detested plain living
What I seek is spiritual excitement
So it may be said that I have created this particular vocation by choosing it, and that I am the only person in the world who has done it
The only private investigator?
The only private consultant to investigate
I didn't take credit for it
This is my unrequited recompense, the joy of my work, the exertion of my special powers
You can close that drawer
You have the wrong idea, doctor!
There's something here that excites me
I hope you have a good day abroad
It's good for your stomach
You know, I was really hoping you could order dinner
What is this?
That's right. I need to be ready for the reception
This came in this morning
Tell me what you think
No date, no signature, no address
Good. Read it loud
"Dear Mr. Holmes."
"The contemptible will be visiting this evening at 7:03pm."
Oh, my God. We only have a few minutes, Holmes
Continue to read
"What matters most to the contemptible," "he will consult with his court."
"Your recent service to the Royal family of Europe indicates that you have been entrusted to undertake..." "... Things too big to say..."
"Well, you can count on it." "This kind of beauty is well known in all quarters."
It's... it's a very secret thing
What do you think that means?
I haven't got anything to go on
Adding a tweet before that is a big no-no
well
But from the body of the word can you deduce what from it?
It must have been the handwriting of some forefather
Very good
It is probable that he has money
This paper should be very expensive
Paper quality is particularly firm and stiff
Those are the two words that are special
This is not a piece of paper made in England at all
Hold it up and look into the light
Ah, a big E and a small G big P and g and a small T interwoven together
Do you know what tao means?
The maker's print
Hello Watson!
Come on!
Let us ask the continental gazetteer
Here's your solani. You see, I didn't mean to forget you came back
Oh Holmes!
Would you like a glass of Whiskey? I'd like to have some later for dinner
This is P A P I R G E S E L L S C H A F T which means "paper factory" in German
As for E g.. E g L o w.. E g L o n I t z there is E G r I a, a German-speaking region of Bohemia famous for its glass factories and
The brim of paper mills is famous for the Bohemian kingdom
This note was written by a German
Only a German could use a verb like this
The guest to come is a German from Bohemia
He went to a covered carriage drawn by two horses
The Watson case, if nothing else, is profitable
Holmes, I think your client would want me gone
I don't know how you're gonna stay in here!
I would be at a loss without my own Bothwell. Assistant Johnson)
But he seems to want to keep it a secret
I could use your help and he could do the same
Just sit here in this armchair and listen to us
He is coming
No, Sir, you can't break in like that!
Mr. Holmes does not receive visitors without an appointment!
Oh, I'm sorry, Mr Holmes!
I can't stop him!
It's all right, Mrs Hudson!
- Would you please go downstairs? - All right
- With a door. - Of course
Xie xie
Did you get my note?
Yes, please sit down!
This is my friend and colleague Dr Watson who often helps me with my cases!
Hello to you
May I ask how to call you?
You can call me Count von Kramm and I'm a Bohemian nobleman
I'd rather talk to you alone
Two at a time, no at all
You can talk to me as much as you can before this gentleman
Well, THEN I'll take your word for it that he's a careful man to be trusted
But first I promise you and I will keep your secret for two years
Isn't it?
It won't matter in two years
It is now so important that it may influence the whole course of European history
I guarantee compliance
I am also
I don't think you like this one
The man who sent me didn't want you to know who he was sending
I confess that what I have just said is not my own true name
I know that
The situation is extremely delicate and we must take some precautions to prevent it from developing into a catastrophe
Lest one of Europe's royal families be severely damaged and frankly implicate the great House of Ormstein
The hereditary king of Bohemia. I know that too... Under the pursuit
You said it.
I am the king
Why should I hide it?
Yeah, really?
I knew before your majesty opened my mouth that I was going to
Wilhelm Gerschlich sigmund von Ormstein
Grand Duke of Cassel the hereditary king of Bohemia spoke
You're also the best duelist in Europe
We've already killed four of our opponents
A fair and just
But when
This is what the story looks like in a nutshell
Ha! Ha!
About ten years ago, during my long visit to Warsaw
Recognized a big ding ding female risk home
Irene Adler
No doubt you are familiar with the name
May I ask you to help me check her Watson on the resource guide
My suspicion, then, is that your majesty has some trouble with this lady and that you are anxious to have those letters returned which you have written to her which are incriminating
A little good
How do you know?
Italy..
Eileen Adler was born in New Jersey in 1858
Is this the right one? New Jersey. Let me see.
The singer, a alto, has retired from opera as prima Donna in Petersburg and Warsaw and is now living in London
It was her who appeared at the concert as gabin
Have you ever been secretly married to her?
Are there no torah documents or testimonies?
Didn't have
Then I shall be your majesty's secret
If this young woman intended deceit or anything else by letters how could she prove that these letters were true?
My handwriting
Bah! fake
My personal letter
steal
I copied it from my own seal
My photo
Buy the
We're both in that picture
Oh, my god. Oh, my god
Well, that's too bad
Your majesty is very careless
She's beautiful and charming and smart and brave
At that time I was only a king
Very young!
I'm not over 30 now
Did your majesty try to take back the photograph?
I've tried and failed
Your majesty must pay
She wouldn't sell it if she bought it
Then steal it
We've tried it five times
Twice I paid a pickpocket to search her house
We switched her tour once while she was traveling
And twice we pulled her over and robbed her
But none of them came back
How dare you laugh at me? !
This is a serious matter!
It is absolutely true
What was she supposed to do with it? She wasn't looking for money
Destroy me
How to destroy it?
I'm going to get married
I've heard about
I will marry Princess Corotilde Rothman von Saxes-Meningen, second daughter of the King of Scandinavia
Nice knot
Yes, you may know their strict rules
She was a very sensitive person in her own right
If there is even the slightest doubt about my conduct this marriage will fall apart
What about Irene Adler?
Threatening to send them the photos
And she would do that
Her personality is as tough as steel
She had the most beautiful face of a woman and the firmest heart of a man
I have to marry another woman who would do anything!
Your majesty why does she do this?
Oh, we talked about getting married
Ha! Ha! She didn't know it was impossible!
Are you sure she hasn't sent them out yet?
I'm sure
Why is that? Maybe the photo is on the way now
Because she had said she would send them out the day of the engagement announcement
That's the first of next Week
But I have to leave London on Friday to prepare for the ceremony
Oh, that still leaves us three days
That's lucky because I have other things on my hands
Where is your Majesty staying in London?
The name of the Wrangham Hotel is Count von Kramer
That, of course,
What about expenses?
There are three hundred pounds in gold and seven hundred pounds in notes
Irene Adler. What's miss Adler's address? Good night, your majesty
I'm sure I'll bring it to you soon
Holmes we can go to dinner at Romano but Friday is only three days away
Oh, it has to be done on Friday
Tchaikovsky himself will perform his work in the St. James Auditorium
Can't go wrong!
It must be finished on Friday
My dear Watson, I want to be alone
Are you hungry?
right
I'm sure Mrs Hudson will be happy to bring you a sandwich
Sandwich? We'll talk tomorrow afternoon
On the evening of Ann
It's a little easier than that, huh, huh?
What?
Not to see
If you wish, I can exchange it with you
What do you do?
Eight weeks as head groom
Isn't it?
You could give me a hand if you want
You look pretty old to me. Why not?
I have to pay the family for the drinks
You're trying to make some wine money
Go saddle the horse and let us see how well you're doing
The coachmen and I took a few hours off the clock
Miss Irene Adler had all the men in the neighbourhood falling at her feet
She's the prettiest thing in the world they say at Serpentine stables
She lived a quiet life and went out every day at five o 'clock and came home for dinner at seven
In addition to acting and singing, she spends her spare time in seclusion
She has only been intimate with one man
He came to see her at least once a day, often twice
This is Mr. Goffley NORTON of Inner Temple
There's a good point in making a good pass with the driver
Mr. Goffley NORTON is a lawyer and that's the point
It might not be so wonderful
Why did he keep coming to see her?
Is she his trusted friend or a lover? If she is a trustee
She had probably given him the photograph for deposit
If she were a lover the first born might not have known it at all
She began to sing
Voice empty spirit moving people Hua Sheng
Then a whole series of things happened that took me by surprise. First came a man who I thought was Goffrey. Mr. NORTON's men
Wait for me
Go and call the master of your house a carriage
Set off right now
Go to Santa Monica church on Edgewell Road
Make it five minutes before twelve at least
That's half a coin if you can do it in 20 minutes
She is truly a beauty whose beauty makes men fall for her
A face that could knock a man off his feet Never heard you say that about anyone, Holmes
I'm just being metaphorical, Watson, nothing more
I was just about to catch up with the wagon and jump into its trunk when another one came along
The driver looked and looked at my poor condition but I jumped in before he could refuse and showed him a handful of gold coins and offered him one if he could keep it for twenty minutes Get to Santa Monica Church
I don't think I've ever been in such a fast carriage
But the other two got here first
Look, I'm really, really sorry, Mr. NORTON, but I...
It's almost noon
It won't work any later
I could have found a lousy preacher but I decided I didn't have to let them know so I sent them for drinks
Oh my god!
In the gove
You're your old brother!
That's you!
A few more minutes and it's out of order!
Come on, old man, come on!
Take this and do what he says
You'll get the money
Ah, we have a witness
The ritual can be continued
We, my friends and brethren, testify before the Lord that the sacrament of marriage for this man and this woman is a very important sacrament which the Lord ordained at the beginning of his creation to signify the union of Christ and the Church Richard
I r e n a
You said I am satisfied now please allow me to say I am satisfied you
I'll see you tomorrow
Early tomorrow morning.
I love you
John
Hey, you!
Come here brother
Come over here
Goffrey let me do it
I want to thank you for your presence when we needed you
I'm lucky to have you with me all the time
On the other hand, I'm not in a hurry
I hope you can handle this one
Don't give me little Fife at all
Oh, Sir, if not, let it be a little memorial
She gave me a pound of gold
Is it
What a strange thing it was!
I'll put it on a watch chain to remember my encounter
So what do we do now?
At the time of the ritual
I think my plan has run out of steam
If this pair is immediately separated from this I have to take the fastest and most powerful measures
But on leaving the church he drove back to Temple and she went back to her place which gave me plenty of time to arrange
How do you say?
Doctor I need your courage and your dexterity
I am very happy!
Aren't you afraid of breaking the law?
Don't
Not afraid of being caught?
I'm not afraid to be the target of gao Shang
Oh, you can't go any higher than that
Then I'll be your man
Too good
The present question is...
Holmes, you are very well dressed!
The question in front of us is where we can find the photo
The land has already been stolen twice
She's too smart to steal it
She is a pretty girl
Those people must have looked for it through and through
But they don't know how to look!
How are you going to find out?
I wasn't looking for it
So what?
I'm gonna get her to show me the picture
But she's not gonna do it
She had no choice
Ah is coming
The rest of the way we are still walking to go
You know what to do
I'll do it if you put your hand up
Rendezvous at the exact spot in ten minutes
She is coming
This can not
I was here first
It was I who opened the door
No, it's not him. It's me!
Get out of my way, you two!
Let me go!
To open a door for a lady is to be the first of his disciples
You can't make us lose money
Let me pass
You leave my groom alone!
Ju-ran took the food out of my mouth!
I give you a dick and you're a dick
Oh, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no!
I'll take care of you!
Hold your hand and you have your hand
After the refund!
Look what you've done!
He is dead!
You can't wait for the police to pick you up!
He's also choking from the blows
I really don't like my husband
You've done a good job
Is he badly hurt?
It is only the skin wound to catch up with the management
We can't have him lying on the street
Let's get him into the house
Ok, Mr.
Oh, are you awake
Thank god thank God You are a brave man
Come on, Willrott
No, no, no, no. You can go
Let me take care of a friend who has come to my rescue
The father looked at me
Oh, that's gonna freak you out
My brave, dear friend
No, no, no. I won't allow it
Thank you for your
Give me a piece of gauze
Just as you said
I'm a little relieved to see you're not badly hurt
Yeah, well, the wound was pretty shallow and the shock was nothing
It's strange
What does a husband mean?
How did so many people get together so suddenly?
They are a gang of slanderers who have arranged to rob you
So many people just grab a small handbag
Oh, no, dear friend. There's not enough money for them to share. I've seen so many poor people in so many places
Even the eyes of the guilty men did not look so strange as to terrify them
Oh, I'm sorry. I feel a little dizzy
Some fresh air in the air!
Willrott open the window!
To pick up a glass of water
Do you have smelling salts?
Man, man, man I can smell a fire somewhere
What?
On fire on fire!
On fire on fire!
Was it on fire?
Come out with me, husband!
I'll take care of the old father!
I can't breathe anymore
Is fake!
It's a false alarm!
This is bad theater is... give them a holler!
Is on fire!
It's a false alarm. You hear that?
There's no need to call the fire police!
What the hell is this?
It's a plumber's smoke bomb. I have a teacher who's a plumber
He said a little bit and threw it into the pipe so you could see where the crack was
No, no, no, no, no, no
The smoke will disperse on its own
You said it was a bad play
Who would do that to me?
Gang member Mrs. Bai
But why?
I have already run away
In order to revenge
The answer?
Are there such evil people?
There are some people in this world who take the reward as their own reward
I don't think I can figure that out
I'm sure you'd like to be the same
I feel much better now
I have to go. Please stay for something to eat
Uh, I have a congregation waiting for me
Then let my cart take you?
Oh, no, no, no, fresh air will let me recover better at least tell me your name and address I thank you very much
I am no more than a humble servant in the service of the Emperor
On the evening of Ann
On the evening of Ann
Doctor, you did a good job
Did you get the photo?
Not yet but I think I know where it is
How did you find out?
She showed me what I said she would do
The question is the photo is still in her hand
Could you please lose the chance to get the photos
Didn't have
I'll call on her first thing tomorrow morning
You're going to find her?
Go in my own name and call the king again
The king? !
There is still you, Hua Sheng!
You have to be a witness
I trust you'll have a good night's sleep, Holmes
Solving a crime is the best cure for sleep loss
Rest in the evening, Mr. Locke Holmes, Watson...
And Holmes?
But she could not love him
Why do I wish she loved him?
In this way your majesty will be spared the fear that he will come out of trouble
If this matron loves her husband she does not love his
If she doesn't love your majesty why should she have to do anything important about your majesty
Mr. Sherlock Holmes, I believe?
I'm Sherlock Holmes.
My mistress has told me that you are more likely to come
She left this morning with her husband. They took the 5:15 train from Charning Cross to the continent
Has she left England yet?
There's no coming back, Sir
Now it's all over!
Take a look at again
Not this picture!
Holmes, here's another picture!
Do you hear me? !
The letter to me
It was written to me
"Dear Mr. Sherlock Holmes, you have indeed done very well."
"Got me all fooled."
"I had no doubt at all until I heard someone Shouting fire," "but then when I realized that I had revealed my secret," "I suddenly knew."
"I was advised months ago to guard you," they said, "if the king were to hire a spy."
"It's you if it is, it's you if it is."
"You still make me reveal the secrets you want to know, even when I see so many people in the street."
"Even when the alarm was issued, I still could not believe that an old shepherd, with whom HE was so dear, could care for his mother."
"But you know."
"I've always been an educated woman."
"I am no stranger to the costume of men," "It is I who follow you to your door," "Sure."
"You are the famous Mr. Sherlock Holmes," "and I took the liberty of saying good night to you."
"Then I'll go to Temple to see my husband."
"We shall be married in secret so that we may not be forced to flee from the king."
"And your appearance is our signal to depart."
"It's a scary thing to be stared at by a man like you."
"For this reason, when you call tomorrow, the building will be empty."
"Your trustee can rest easy on that picture."
"I love a man far better than he and he loves me."
"The king may..."
"The king is free to do as he pleases and not to worry about the troubles of those whom he has wronged."
"I kept that photograph for my own protection, as if it were a weapon that would come to me," "Whatever kind of hand he might take to protect me."
There are the following
"I have left another photograph which I suppose he would like to keep." "Dear Sherlock. Mr. Holmes. "" Irene NORTON Adler."
What a horny woman!
What an admirable queen she could have been!
What a pity it is not to grow old with her
What I said to this lady
She is very difficult, your whitehead and regret that I was not able to fulfill the mandate given to me
The very opposite father
I can't think of a more rounded knot
I know she means what she says
Now that photo is as safe as if it had been burned
I was very pleased to hear your majesty say so
I'm really excited about you. Please tell me what I can do in return
This ring finger?
I think your majesty has another one
You only open the mouth of something more valuable than this finger
This picture this picture of Irene?
If that's what you want
Thank you, your majesty. I wish you a pleasant morning
This is how the kingdom of Bohemia runs into a great scandal and Sherlock. Holmes's best plan ever
How can a woman's wisdom be lost? He often laughs at a woman's long hair and short sense
But I haven't heard him say that lately, and when he mentions Irene... Adler or that woman
He began to append her as "the daughter" in his eyes, and no one else could surpass her as the "dumpling" among women
This is not to say that he felt anything like love for Irene Adler -- any feeling, especially love
It was all because of his rigid, rigid head that he had a diseased eye for women
It wasn't as if they were the engine of a crime or the thread of a crime but he kept her picture hidden and locked it up
There was only one woman he could not forget in his dim memory, the beautiful Irene. Adler
This is countess Morcar's house
Thank you. Thank you. Oh, my God, she's back
She dismounted
Fast ryder
hurry
It's fixed. It should be fixed
I hate to see the plumber hanging around her house
All right, don't worry. I fixed it
Listen to you I can speed up the work faster
It's really beautiful
Beucheff's, huh?
So when you go on a date, you wear it.
Let's get out of here
Just put it on one side
It's for the three of you
The Seshefs wish you a merry Christmas
Get me a tea cusack
A good wife
I need a cup of tea to lift my spirits
The preparations before Christmas were a real grind
You're right
Then take a shower
His people
The Blue Jewel the blue jewel was stolen
Keep your eyes open
Oh, John, she's gonna love it. It's so beautiful
Just like her mother
But can we afford it?
I told you I made a little money lately
Even if there is no money, it is Christmas
That's very thoughtful of you John Horner I'm so lucky
His wife and children in the
Live like a god and buy this baby for a girl
What would you say to our son on this ship? Just let it be
Couldn't wait to fence Horner?
What do you mean? I didn't do anything. What are you thinking?
John Frederick Horner
You're guilty of stealing from the Countess of Morcar
The price under the name is worth even the city
You said I didn't steal it. I didn't steal it
Someone saw someone in your hotel
I'm not the one who stole it. Trust me
Let me go. I didn't steal it
Oh!
Mr Holmes?
Mr Holmes?
Mr. Peterson, janitor of Aberset.
Leave me alone when he needs you
Oh!
Sorry to bother you, Mr Holmes
Peterson put the goose down and your hat
I love it when you buy a fat goose for Christmas dinner
But the problem is also here, Mr Holmes
The goose is not mine
You might say I got it
"To Mrs. Henry Baker."
Obviously this isn't your hat
He is not the first
I don't know what to do about this extraordinary situation
It was a little too small a call
I told my wife about it and she suggested that I come to you
You are too wise to sit down, my dear friend
Tell me about the special situation
The good one is this one
I was on my way home last night and I just finished one
This is the time of the year when several of our doorkeepers get together.
I wish you luck on the next day
Don't wrong
Holiday wishes
You are so cruel to sensei
Here's to your health
Like I said I'm on my way home
Something unexpected has come up
Hey, are you doing it? Hey, it's the police. Run, run, run
flee
I'm trying to help you, old man
The mob ran in one direction
I tried to stop him but he clearly thought I was a security officer
Arrest him for breaking glass
So you've made off with two pieces of this old felt hat
And a fine Fat Christmas goose which I am anxious to return to Mr Holmes
But I don't know where to begin dear Peterson I see your dilemma
I don't care what I said
My wife and I decided to put these two things together
The hat and the goose are brought to you. Mr Holmes wondered whether this small matter would interest you in your particular profession
I hope I haven't wasted your time, Mr Holmes of course not
All right, doorman
Have you bought your goose yet?
Haven't?
Then I suggest you take this goose home and fulfill its destiny
And I'm just saving my old blanket hat that I never saw before I lost my Christmas dinner
Do as you say, Mr Holmes and leave it at that
It may be cold but there are signs that it's time to eat it no need to put it back
Well, THEN I'll be out of my way, Mr Holmes
I'll contact you as soon as there's a show
Good Mr.
Uh, have a nice day
And to you and yours too
You haven't found the gem yet
I don't have a husband
But we caught the thief Horner
What about the cord of the gem
We infer that
He could have helped a murderer. Why?
Man and small said the love of the festival just exactly opposite
Petty thieves don't have a reputation when they see money they throw it away Money You mean a reward?
Well, that's right
Why should I make a contribution?
In my experience it seems to have worked
I found a reward to draw out the greedy thief
Isn't it?
It would be strange if no one came for 24 hours
How much is the prize?
Holmes? Oh you are in
The Countess of Morcar has offered a reward of 1,000 pounds for information on the sapphire's whereabouts
Inspector Bradlitt in section B is in charge of the case
He's already arrested John Horner 3, 6, a plumber who vehemently protested his innocence
Further evidence confirmed that the case had been referred to the Returning tribunal
Horner fainted and was carried out of the courtroom during an emotional closing statement
I'm sorry you're busy right now
I'm disturbing you with your hat
No, it's all worthless shit
But several of its questions are not so trivial as instructive
I think this hat looks like it's connected to something sexual that's going to help you solve a crime ring
No, no, no, no, this is just one of the many things that happen in a world of marbles with four million mouths crammed into a few square miles
And what do you see in this old felt hat?
You don't know how I do things
To the people who wear these stupid felt hats
Did you get anything out of it? It was Watson with a fat goose
On the fat goose's left leg was a card that read, "To Mrs. Henry Baker."
Divide by the indentation
H.b. hypothetically means "Henry Baker." I can't see anything else
On the contrary Watson you see everything but you make no inferences about what you see
You have too little faith in your own reasoning
Tell me what you got out of this hat?
This is a man who knows a lot. You can see it in his eyes
And in the past three years, life should be rich
Though he was poor and down and out he saw far away, not as he is now, not as he used to be
And he was afraid that this might be the reason why his wife no longer loved him
My dear Holmes
But he still retains the ultimate self-respect. He lives in a simple house
He's a middle-aged man with gray hair that's been cut in the last few days and lime cream on his hair
And he must not have a kerosene lamp in his house
You must be having a laugh
Roots are not meant to be funny
I have no doubt that I am very late
Bill fang said how did you deduce that he learned to know Fubo?
This is an integration problem
There must be a lot of money in the brain bag
Which family is falling?
This kind of flat brimmed hat
Very popular three years ago, Watson this is a very good hat
Look at the silk band and the rich lining
If he had been able to afford such an expensive hat three years ago
Then he was down and he was down. What if he had a distant vision and was ruined like this?
This shows that he has a long history of selling hats without elastic straps
So he ordered it just to show that he's far-sighted
He used this method to prevent the cap from being blown away
But you see, he broke the elastic and didn't take the time to get a new one to show that he had lost his will
well
There are a few other things
He is a middle-aged man
Grey hair
I just had my hair cut recently
A dab of lime cream on his head
All of these can be broken off from the inspection of the lower part of the hat lining
The wet marks indicate that he sweats a lot and is not a man who works hard
So his wife he just said she doesn't love him anymore
This hat hasn't been brushed in weeks
For example, if I see a man whose hat has collected the dust of the zodiac, and his wife and son ignore it
I fear he has unhappily lost the love of his wife
He might be single, too
No, he wanted to give the goose to his wife as a goodwill gift
Don't forget the card attached to the goose's leg
You can always find an answer
wait
How can you deduce that he doesn't have a kerosene lamp in his house?
A drop of candle oil, or two, may occasionally be dropped
But Watson, when I saw more than five drops, knew he couldn't have got candle grease from a kerosene lamp
Are you full?
You have a good brain
The goose, Mr Holmes the goose
Why is it so hard to know it's alive again? Flapping wings out of the kitchen window?
Look at that
My wife found something in the chest
Oh, my God, Peterson, this is a hidden treasure. Do you know what it is? A diamond a jewel
Cut glass with it like putty
This is not an ordinary gem
But the precious stone
The sapphire from the world Hotel robbery
It's true
The ten thousand pounds on offer was less than one twentieth of the market price of the sapphire
Ten thousand, ten thousand pounds for god's sake
You must admit, Watson that I deduced from the hat
Its importance can be steep increase
That's Holmes the problem we're trying to solve now is sorting out everything from the stolen gems to the discovery of the goose
The sequence of events in this period
This is the gem the gem came from the goose the goose came from Mr. Henry Baker
He wore an old felt hat and had some other peculiary
What we are now trying to do is to identify the father and clarify his role in the mystery
I found a goose and a black felt hat at the corner of Goodge Street
Mr. Henry Baker please pick it up at Baker Street 221b at 6:30 p.m. Simple and clear
Yes, but will he see it? Surely he would have told the poor that it was a grievous loss
Peterson sent it to the AD agency
And to be published in all the evening papers available in which newspaper first?
The Globe, the Star, the Pall Mall, the St. James's Palace, the Echo, the News Evening, the Standard, and every other paper you can think of
I'm going to see the sensei
What about the gem?
I'll keep this gem for now
Thank you Peterson
Mr. Quick Hand and Peterson
Can you pick me up a goose on the way back?
Give him the money, Watson
I must buy Mr. Henry Baker a goose to replace the one you and your family will enjoy
Thank you very much, Sir
Ten thousand pounds?
What do you do with this gem?
I'm going to put it in my cupboard
Mr Nath
The Beatlemen are mad at me because you're locked up but she's more worried about the jewel
I've never taken a treasure stone to cure a security officer.
Tell me where you hid it
Perhaps I can help you plead with the judge
But if you don't know your face
I've been on the straight and narrow ever since I married Jerry
If you don't tell the truth
When the sheriff finds out about your ex
I'm afraid you'll never see your lovely wife again
I got you horner but I need the gem more
It's a beautiful stone. Look at all the light and color
And yet it is the root of sin and every precious stone is like this
They are the lure of evil spirits
Each cut surface on a larger and older stone represents the suffering of sin
It was found beside a river in Xiamen, south China
Its peculiarity lies in the fact that it is blue and it has the distinctive feature of a red gem
This precious stone is less than 20 years old
Tube flow is not long in the world but has a history of not comparable
Two homicides a sulphuric acid disfigurement a homicide and several robberies all attributed to this 40-grain crystallized carbon
Who would have thought that such a beautiful ornament could be a supplicant to the hanging-rack and prison?
Into the to
Are you Mr. Henry Baker?
Please sit near the wall stove
It is so cold today that I think your circulation is better in summer than in winter
Sit down quickly
This is my good friend and partner, Dr. Watson
Hello Mr.
Mr Baker
Is this your hat?
Yes, it's my hat
Thank you, Sir
I'm trying to find something but I'm not as shy as I used to be
I took away the hat and the goose for the vagabonds that attacked me
I don't think we have to pay more for something we can't get back
Of course I can figure that out
By the way, we've already eaten your goose
ate
If the fruit does not do that goose is really not worthy of food
But we bought another goose and it was on the sideboard
I think it should be just as heavy as your goose and just as fresh
Oh, of course
Still we kept the original goose's woolly legs waiting, if you wish
I don't see any use for my goose's zero-star shred except that
If you don't mind
I... I think my concern is me -- I'm going to focus my attention on that fat goose I saw in your pantry
Where did you get that goose
I am very interested in domestic poultry and I have seldom seen such good fat geese
So I'm very interested in the goose's knobs you bought
It was the club that gave birth to my first goose club
Goose club? Be a little more specific
I... I'm not a rich man as you can see
I live a humble but dignified life and let's just say I work at the British Museum
Do research?
I guess so and help other people with their research
I read a lot of books
I left the museum in the morning and at noon that day
I went to see some of my colleagues at the Alpha Inn Museum
I often go to that shop this year
Mr. Wendgate started a goose club and in consideration of paying a few pence a week to the club we all got a goose for Christmas
A nice fat goose for your Mr. Baker
It's a hard to see fat goose
Now you can patch things up with your wife and son, right?
I'm afraid she's a little bit of a fan
I'm sure things will turn out well for me when I find something that pays again
Oh, it must be a technical job
I'm good at it
This is the 8 benzodiacs I owe you last time
"Quick money," Mr. Baker? I bumped into one of them
It is true that a familiar person with a sympathetic heart is rich
I sold him some of my books
It's not your book, Mr. Baker
It had to be that This winter Mr. Wendgate was more miserable than ever
We should not give up the things we love and the people we marry
Let's put this gesture aside while I relax the pressure
So I'll have a large whiskey and a pint of your best beer
Merry Christmas.
Merry Christmas, Mr. Baker
On my way home
I was attacked by a mob for stealing my geese
I lost my cap in the twisting, too
All I can remember is a police officer in a uniform showing up and we all ran away
That's something we can figure out
Under the circumstances
It is good that bears good
Thank you very much for your trouble, Mr. Smith
I think this scotch hat
It's not fit for my age or my body
Happy festival, Mr. Sheng
So are you, Sir
Thank you for your
By the way, do you have a kerosene lamp?
Kerosene lamps certainly don't have very good Christmas cheer
Merry Christmas to you both, too
Well, this is the end of Mr. Henry Baker
He obviously doesn't know anything about the gems, Mrs. Hudson
Watson, are you hungry?
Not very hungry
Too good
Mrs. Hudson can turn our dinner into a midnight snack
We're gonna touch the vine while it's hot
Could it be hotter than a midnight snack?
Good evening, gentlemen. It's really cold tonight
It's true, Mr. Board
What would you like to drink?
Beer huasheng? What? Oh good
Two of your best beers, please
Wait a moment, Mr.
If your beer is as good as your goose it is the purest beer
My goose?
We just spoke to Mr. Henry Baker, a member of your Goose club, half an hour ago
Oh, well, those geese aren't ours
Whose is that?
I bought two or four from a vendor in Covent Park
What's his name?
Breckinridge was a supplier who always had a good supply
Remind yourself if you want to buy a goose
I can ride up to him and you know this is the busiest time of the year
Thank you for your advice
Can I get you another beer?
God bless you, Sir
Go find Breckinridge right now
Do you have to go now?
Watson we're following up on a lead that the police have overlooked that just happened to fall into our hands
We have to follow the line to the bottom of it and we're heading south at a fast pace
Don't cry
I want to believe you too John really
But I can't argue with what the policeman said
But they only said they took me because I was there
I'm just doing odd jobs
Is it really like this?
I promised you when WE were married
I will never lie to you
I have always kept my promise
I want to believe you, too
Good evening
Good evening
I see your geese are all sold out
You got five hundred to sell in the morning
It's too late. There's more at the stall with the kerosene lamp on
But my family brought me to you
Who?
The owner of the Alpha Inn
Yeah, he bought two or four from me
Those geese were right
Can I tell you where you got it?
Okay, Mr.
What are you thinking about?
There are to the point
I have made myself very clear
I just want to know who supplied those geese you sold to Alpha
I don't want to tell you this is it
It's a small thing but I don't know why you're so angry
Big liver fire try to get caught up in this
I pay through the nose for good stuff and that's the end of it, right?
What? "Where's the goose?" "Who did you sell it to?" "How much did you sell it for?"
It's like you know there's no other goose in the world
I assure you I have nothing to do with the rest of your inquiries
Ask to check? This is a simple question
I'm not gonna Sue you
Well, that bet's gonna blow
What's the bet? What's the bet?
For ever will I hold fast my way of thinking about domestic birds
I bet my friend here five pounds that the goose I chose was raised on a farm, right?
What? Yeah, yeah, yeah, that's what happened
Then you lost because he was raised in the city
It's not like that
That's what I don't believe
Bring me the money, Holmes
You think I don't understand because I've known domestic birds since I was a kid
I'm telling you the geese sold to Alpha are all raised in the city
You can't convince me
Please holmes is willing to take the gamble
Are you willing to bet?
That will only make you lose money
And yet I would bet you a sovereign to teach you to believe in yourself
Clinch a deal that good
Take a closer look at Mr. Hubris and here's my account book with a list of people who sold me geese
This page is full of countrymen
This page in red ink is all about suppliers in the city
Read me the name of the third person
Mrs Oakeshott 11 17 Brixton Road
Guest code 2, 4, 9
Good. Take another look at the ledger
Mrs. Oakeshott's egg and poultry supplier?
What was the last entry?
24 geese sold to Wendgate, Alpha Inn, for seven shillings and six pence
Do you have anything else to say?
What about the first five pounds?
Well done, Holmes
To see Mrs. Oakeshott tonight?
It's not you again. It's not you
I told you they're all sold out
Listen to me there are two grey-crested geese
Look, I'm sick and tired of you and your geese and you can go fuck yourself
If you bother me with any more of this nonsense
I'll set the dogs on you
Listen, Mrs. Oakeshott told me...
You bring Mrs. Oakeshott here and I'll give her an answer
But what's that got to do with you?
Did I get my goose from you?
No, but there's a goose in there that's mine
Then you go to Mrs. Oakeshott and ask her to send me to you
You can ask the King of Prussia for it's none of my business
I've had enough
Get the hell out of here
It'll save us a trip to Brixton
I'm sorry I couldn't help overhearing your conversation with that dealer
I think I can help you with that, too
Really? Who are you?
I'm Sherlock Holmes and it's my job to know things that no one else knows
But you can't know that
I know the opposite
I understand you're trying to locate a batch of geese that Mrs. Oakeshott of Brixton Road sold to Breckinridge
Breckinridge sold the goose to Mr. Wendgate of the Alpha Inn
You are the one I am looking for
I cannot express how much I am interested in the matter
Then I suggest we discuss this in a more comfortable place
The horse car
Come in!
I'm going to change into my slippers
I guess we need to know who we're working for, right, Watson?
John Robinson
No, no, no, I asked for your real name
It's not always easy to use a name for business
Well, then my real name is Ryder James Ryder
Yes, Mr. Ryder the foreman of the World Hotel
right
You should be interested to know that the goose in particular is the one with the white body and the gray crown?
Oh, Sir, can you tell me where it is?
It came to me and you? Unfortunately, it is no longer here
But the goose died and laid an egg
The prettiest, shiniest little blue egg I've ever seen
Here, let me show you
The game is over ryder
Stand firm when your heart falls into the furnace
He's too thin a poor bastard to be brave enough to commit a serious crime
I've got everything I need to know about this case and there's nothing you can tell me
Catherine Cusack put me up to it
She was a servant of the Bechefes
Yeah you heard through the grapevine that Horner was involved in a similar burglary
And then what did you do you and your partner Cusack did something in the Countess's room
Try and get Horner in there
And you stole the gems and called the cops and the unfortunate Horner went to jail
For god's sake, have pity on me
Think about my dad and my mom and they're gonna be heartbroken
I've never done anything bad before and I'll never do it again
I will swear with my hand upon the holy scripture
Don't send me to court, Mr Holmes
Don't do that for god's sake
Sit back in your chair
Now he's on his knees begging for mercy why don't you have a little pity for Horner who's in the dock because of you without even knowing it?
I will be far away, Mr Holmes
I will leave this country
Then the accusation against him will be dropped
We'll talk about that later
Now tell me how the jewel got into the goose's belly
And how did the goose end up in the market?
Tell me that this is your only hope for survival
I will tell you everything that has happened
I thought it best to take the jewel and get away because I never knew when the police would want to search me and my room
There is not a safe place in the hotel
I walked out of the hotel pretending to be on an errand and then went to my sister's house to settle the score again
What's the matter, Jem? You look terrible
I'm a little shaken up there's been a burglary at the Maggie's hotel
You are quick to into the house
I went into her backyard where she raised geese and smoked and wondered what to do
I remember being in a panic before DECIDING where to hide the head for the time being
Suddenly I saw geese squawking in the corner of the courtyard
My sister once told me that I could have a goose for Christmas
I picked out a goose with a grey crown a nice fat goose
I thrust the jewel into its throat and into its throat as far as my fingers can reach
I have put to rest all my troubles and pains at this time.
What are you doing with that goose, Jem? You said I could pick one for Christmas
I'm trying to figure out which one is the fattest
We saved yours. We called it "Jem's goose."
Well, Maggie, it's all the same to you
I want the one I just had on my hand
But the one I left for you weighs three pounds
We've been fattened up for a long time
I'll take that one. I'll take it right away
Whatever you
Which one do you want?
The one with the gray crown in the middle okay
Just kill it and take it with you
I did as she asked, Mr Holmes
I took the goose to my friend's house and we used knives
Opening the goose chilled my heart
There was no sapphire in the chest I knew something was afoot
Where are all the geese?
Sold it to a dealer
Which merchant?
Breckinridge in Covent Park
Tell me, is there another goose with a grey cap?
Yeah, there were two of them
Even I can't tell them apart
What's the matter? Why are you panicking?
I ran as fast as I could to Breckinridge
But he's already sold all the geese and won't tell me who I sold them to
It's driving me crazy
Now I've been branded "petty thief" even though I didn't get the treasure THAT I sold my identity for
Please forgive me
Please forgive me
Get out of here
What?
May god bless you, Sir
Give me to shut up
Roll!
I must admit Holmes this is a bit of a surprise
I haven't been invited to the police station to tell them what they don't know
I may have committed a terrible crime but I may have saved someone
If we put him in prison he'll be a prisoner all his life
Then it came at the very moment of forgiveness
In the middle of the
Merry Christmas, Holmes
Merry Christmas to my dear friends, etc
I can't eat when I think about Holmes and John Horner being locked up
Do you think That Brazztree or his associates might still be working the case?
You're right, Watson. Let's go
Here's your tea, Mrs Buckley
Your tea is too much
I hate you. I hate you
I hate you. I hate you
Big who
- Your tea is too
- David, you betrayed him
Mr Ning Mrs.
What's wrong with you, kid
The door won't open
I'll try
You two have to stop him
Mrs. Barkley opened the door
Mrs. Barkley opened the door
The door was locked from the inside and there was no key
I'll call the medic and police
There were many of them when I sailed home with my injuries
Very well done in counterinsurgency in India
You're not gonna regret taking this case
Ah the sentry
Dr Watson is a former army doctor with the Royal Berkshire Regiment who now practices his own medicine
I'm Lieutenant Colonel Murphy and I'm now in temporary charge of the Royal Marros regiment following the tragic death of the colonel
This must be Mr. Holmes
Please have a seat
I'm glad you got here so soon
You're welcome
I've explained to Mr. Holmes how worried you must be about the potential scandal
Xie xie
The honor of the regiment now rests upon me
But the papers say there's gotta be something in there
Certainly no
I have driven the writers as far away as I can
They are all the more suspicious
They must have sniffed out the mystery, even if they knew very little
Oh, but it can't be renewed. Bring back their energy.
Is the
You can see how much we need your help, Mr Holmes
What do you say? Sherlock Holmes
What can I say
Colonel Murphy you didn't tell me anything!
I came to Aldersolt on the strength of Watson's efforts to convince him that he was far more interested in military affairs than I was
You should have told me the truth when I came!
The commanding officer of this regiment
Colonel James Buckley was found dead in his apartments around 10:00 last night
The body was found in the early morning sitting room by Private Colonel Bates' messenger
There was a two-inch-long wound in the back of the head that clearly had been caused by blunt force trauma
On the floor next to the body was a peculiar hand-carved wooden stick
And lying on the couch in a coma, Nancy Barkley is Mrs. Barkley
Go back to Colonel Murphy, please
The servants only noticed the tragedy when they heard the quarrel between Colonel Buckley and his wife
The servants tried to enter the morning room but found the door locked
Bates went round to the garden and entered through the French window
Is it Mrs. Buckley you're looking at now
Yeah, but she's definitely not the kind of person to do that
I was lieutenant to the late Colonel Buckley in his regiment for many years
So I know Mrs. Buckley very well
But when
Tell me more about Colonel Buckley is he held in high regard by his men
Considering his back, he is highly esteemed
His back view? Can't you tell what kind of stain he has
No, but nobody on the outside knows that James... Buckley had been a private in maros's regiment
Is it?
It is a rare accomplishment to rise from a second class soldier to a commanding officer in the same regiment
He got his promotion because of his bravery in the Indian insurgency and he's been rising faster than I have over the years
Of really let a person imprint elephant deep engrave
Is the unfortunate Mrs. Buckley in custody?
No, all of it
She's in the hospital with people watching her and a police officer in there
Nancy Barkley is a very respectable woman now but you should have seen her as a young woman in India thirty years ago
She is the daughter of a soldier regiment
Her father was a master Sergeant of the Regiment warrant Officer Devoy and so a formidable father-in-law to any soldier
I remember that all my companions thought her the prettiest girl in the land
As a junior military officer, I never knew her well, but I did notice that she was as charming and energetic as a great aunt
So of course Buckley wasn't the only one in the regiment
The man who courted her but he was her final choice
They were married at Balti, not far from Camber, in the summer of 1858, a few months after General Neale's troops had freed our regiment from the encirclement
Soon after her marriage
Sergeant Buckley was promoted just as you'd expect
Marriage may have had a rough start for the Buckleys
A low-born sergeant married the daughter of a regimental sergeant major
Yeah, there should be some social rubbing
But Nancy charmed them off and they were quickly accepted
Buckley's career was on the rise five years ago when the regiment returned from India
Buckley was promoted to corps commander
Have they been very lucky in their marriage?
It looks like it is
Look?
Most people regard the marriage as very happy
What do you think of Colonel Murphy
I got to visit the Buckleys a lot because I was number two
I saw the other side of their marriage
More important than your loyalty to the deceased
I had dinner at the Buckleys' one night
It was at the end of the driveway that I remembered I'd left my cigaratelle box in the dining room
I walked back and the front door was still open
Jane's a maid and she's in the lobby
I'm so glad you're still here
I left my ketchup box on the table
I think Colonel Buckley and His wife are both in bed, Sir
James, for god's sake
Tell the truth. Who is it? Who is it?
Let me go. You're hurting me
Then tell me you love me and no one else
Do you hear me? Do you hear me?
Would I marry you if I didn't love you
I don't know when I really want to know
This jealous brawl took place shortly after your departure, Colonel Murphy
So tell me about This Guy, Buckley is he a violent person or not?
Sometimes yes
He has nothing to show for his younger children
But if you have to climb all the way up, you must have some patience to do it
Surely he would not feel unwell enough to point the finger?
There will be times when he will suddenly become very dark
To the queen
To the queen
Sometimes we would talk about some old battle primir or the insurgency or the war in Afghanistan and suddenly the smile would disappear from his lips as if it had been snatched from him by an invisible hand Like the
Yes, having served in India for so long does have some impact
I see it in Berkshire too
Did you mention a hand-carved wooden stick next to the body that the colonel brought back from India as a souvenir
The servants said they had never seen the stick before
I haven't seen one in my many visits
It's a long one
Did the police take it in for inspection?
Is the
They felt it was a weapon
Is it
I think we should start by visiting the Colonel's residence but it would be nice if we could see Mrs. Buckley first
I'm afraid she's still in the dark
I think so, too
David... David...
What a beautiful morning
Holmes could Mrs. Buckley have had a lover and Colonel Buckley knew about it?
Colonel Murphy seems pretty close to her
You are aware that this kind of warmth is very common between officers and women in hot service
Thank you, Watson, for enlightening me on military morality
If Murphy and Mrs. Buckley were really having an affair would he have brought up that little episode about forgetting the cigar box?
It was probably half past seven when I was waiting for dinner
One night a month Mrs Buckley goes to Aldersolt to do charity work
You're in such a hurry about where you're going
I answered at eight o 'clock, Ann. Morrison
I'll be at the grand hall in time
Those jumpers jumping up and down in your old clothes are what make you sick
Well, that's up to you
I think we should give back what we've got
We've been lucky enough that other people don't
Don't come back too late
I won't
Mrs. Buckley was supposed to be back at 9:15, Sir
I was in the kitchen helping the cook with the dishes
There was a distant thunder
I was just saying to Mrs Fenning, "Looks like a storm is coming," when the bell rang in the living room in the morning
I arrived to find Mrs. Barkley back
She paced up and down the room, sitting still and pale
She looks like a mess, Sir
Did you ring the bell too
Yes, I'd like some tea, please
A good wife
Jane is that you
Yes, Sir. I feel like I've heard too much
Yes, she was in her room in the morning
Waking up in the morning? Yes, Mr.
I was just about to bring a pot of tea to Mrs
Tea? What kind of tea are you waiting for at this hour
So that was the last time Mr. Buckley was seen alive?
Yes, Mr.
Do you suppose you know why your mistress will go to her morning quarters? It was so late that there was no fire
I don't know the Tao Sensei
Did she avoid going to school by accident?
Did you hear them arguing before
No precursors as far as I know
When you came back from the kitchen with the tea you found the door locked and heard them raise it
Tell me exactly what you heard
They were arguing with each other
She said she was a coward at school
She said you had ruined my life for years
The wife called out the name David
Said the two
The big who? Do you swear to that?
Thousands of true million is born
But the colonel's name is James
Have you ever heard of a woman named D, A, V, I, D before?
No colonel and no missus know anyone named David
Colonel Murphy's Christian name was Patrick
Have they had a guest named David lately?
There was no first born
Colonel Buckley's body was found with a wooden stick have you ever seen it before?
There is no colonel
There were some trophies from India but not the stick
Are you sure, Miss Stoall?
Yes, Mr.
I don't know where that came from
Thank you. That's all for today
Oh, no, there's the last thing
Colonel Murphy once left a cigar box behind did you find it
Yes, Mr.
Go to school and lie down here, Sensei
Head by the grate?
Yes, Mr.
You can also see blood stains
But the worst thing was his face
His face?
I turned him over
I almost fainted when I saw his face
A twisted and sinister look filled with fear
It's like seeing the God of death?
It may well be a precursor of
Thank you Bates
What kind of ghosts can scare school like that?
It's definitely not Nancy Barkley
The door was locked and the key was gone
Gone?
At last we had to call a locksmith to open the door
Have you searched for the key?
I looked all over the place
Mrs. Buckley didn't take it and it's not in Colonel Buckley's pocket
Thank you, Mrs Fenning
Watson if the key wasn't in the door and the Buckleys didn't take it then...
Then there should be a third person
That's right. That person wants to go in through this window and out through it
These are the footprints of Bates
But these belong to someone else
He had been walking through the grass only a short time ago and the trail was clearly visible
He came in and out the window Watson we're on the right track
Watson, look at this.
- What is this? - The stranger had an unusual companion
Is the dog? Whose dog is it?
Does anyone hear a dog gnaw at the window curtain
Is it just a cat?
These paw prints are not those of a cat or a monkey or any other creature we are familiar with
15 inches less from rear to front PAWS
Add in the length of the neck and the pouch of the brain and this animal can be as little as two feet long and even longer with a tail
It also has an odd stride length which indicates that this animal has a long body and short legs
Like a stoat or weasel?
We also know it's a carnivore
How do you know?
Paw prints show him biting through the curtain
Want to eat goldfinch
Don't wrong
And what was this beast when he was born
I can't be a traitor. Friends, don't push me
Miss Morrison had been happy and content when Mrs. Barkley left home the night before
But two hours later she came home a different person
The police now suspect that she's the killer
It's your job to clear her name
You must tell me what happened that night that made her so great
Well if I can help her I'll break my promise to keep it secret
This is what happened...
Unusual
Here we often see shapes and colors of people
But the night before I had seen the strangest man I had ever seen
His knees bent as he walked with a crooked back and a lame leg
His black face wrinkled like a shriveled apple
I secretly think that there really are some people in the world who suffer far more than they should
The man was dressed in eastern garb which made him look even more awkward
I pointed him out to Nancy and thought he deserved our special attention
Nancy was really in a good mood that night and I saw her go up to the guy and ask him if he needed help
And that's when she changed
She talked to the man and then suddenly turned pale
She looked as if she had seen a ghost
The man could not see her. I could see him gesticulating furiously
Then Nancy and the man went into a quiet corner and they talked for a while and I heard the man let out an angry scream and then he ran out shaking his fist What happened to Nancy
Are you all right?
Who is that pitiful family friend?
It's an old friend of mine in bad shape
Promise me Annie you won't say anything about this to anyone, okay
If you want me to keep it secret, I will answer it
Who is that man's?
I knew you were gonna ask me that
Nancy left after the encounter
I naturally asked the regular guests about this man
This unusual man was bound to attract some attention
It seems that he was a soldier returning from India and no one knows anything else about his history except that he earned his living by entertaining troops and performing magic tricks
Did you tell the police about this man?
No promise is a promise
Yes, of course
Thank you, Miss Morrison.
That's our intruder's four-legged companion
A mongoose
I think we've found the man we're looking for
Mr. Henry Wood has just arrived from India
May I have a word with you
What does it matter
The death of Colonel Buckley
She deserves nothing, I swear to you
Then you're the one who's guilty
No, I deserve nothing, too
Then who took down Colonel Buckley?
It was providence that killed him and his sinful heart
You'd better explain that
On the emperor if I really beat his brain bag its fact I always think this kind of do come that is also he deserves
No, I never laid a finger on his head
Someone saved me the jitters
Let me tell you my story
I have nothing to be ashamed of
Before you shall be a man whose back is like a hump, and whose ribs are all askew
But I, Corporal Henry Wood, was the handsomest man in the Royal Maross regiment
Were you in the same regiment as Colonel Buckley?
No, he was only a second class back then
We belonged to the same army and had one thing in common: we both fell in love with the same woman: Nancy. Germany walter,
She is the daughter of the regimental sergeant major
Two people love her and she only loves one
She... you're gonna laugh when you see me curled up in front of the fire and hear me say that Nancy loves me for how handsome I am
I'm the one she's always loved
But though I have won her heart her father would not approve
I'm a reckless little boy but I'm honest
Nancy's father asked her to marry Buckley
He's careful to stay out of trouble and do nothing wrong unlike me who took Nancy to places her father didn't like
And Buckley was educated. He had a bright future.
Naturally, Warrant Officer Devoy felt Buckley was a better fit for his daughter
But she was loyal to me and we would have been married if it hadn't been for treason
So why didn't Nancy marry the man she loved
It was the rainy season of 1857 when the Sepoys suddenly mutinied
The regiment was besieged at Porte
There are 10,000 rebels around us like dogs around an old rat cage
We are short of ammunition and food and have only managed to contact General Neal's advancing forces
So that we can be saved
Our commanders are beginning to select a volunteer who must be strong enough to slip out of his camp at night and make contact with the troops on the ground
Stupidly, I volunteered
It was a dangerous operation with 1,000 brothers in danger
But when I was there was only one person in my mind
Nancy Devoy my love the most beautiful girl with the breath of life between her lips
Saying goodbye to her is the hardest thing in the world
I had no idea when we exchanged our letters
This is thirty years
That night my rival in love saw me heading out through the enemy line Sergeant Buckley
He says no one knows the landscape better than he does
I would like to deliver the letter
He volunteered to help me figure out the best route to take
After listening to him finish, he was under the protection of the fire power of his friends
I set out
Buckley told me to follow a stream and then come to a ravine
He said it was the best way down the mountain
His guidance was perfect and soon I was wading through icy streams of snow from the Previous day in the Himalayas
I could see no more lamps and fires in the rebel camp than I went down to the valley, past their sentry posts
He made himself safe
All of a sudden I was hit
Something hit me hard on the head and I felt the sky spinning
When I woke up, I found myself hanging from a tree like a chicken, tied tightly together
He felt the pain as if he were twisted into a hemp flower
I don't care what's so hard for me is that I failed at my job
What's going to happen to those people I'm going to save
But the biggest blow was yet to come and I realized I'd been sold out when I heard one of the rebels talking
And the guy who sold me out was the guy who showed me the way Barkley sold me out so he could have the girl I loved
Now do you know what James Barkley is good at
To our surprise, General Neal's troops are already on their way to rescue Balti
The rebels withdrew and took me with them and I was tortured
I tried to escape from being abused
I haven't seen a white person in all those years
My captors fled north into the mountains and held me as a slave
Not even a dog like me they've broken every bone in my head
There were moments when I wished they had killed me but it was my hatred of the man who had ruined my life that fueled my desire for life
I dreamed of getting revenge on Buckley
One day an Afghan tribe killed the rebels who were holding me
I was left there to die and I survived like a miracle
I want revenge for my suffering and I don't have Buckley
And Nancy I don't even know if she's alive or dead
I wandered back to Punjab where I lived with the locals and studied as a street magician
Learned to live by magic
What was the point of sailing back to England with my old companions when I was a poor cripple?
Even the thought of revenge could not bring me back
Let me get this straight
I'd rather Nancy and the boys at Maros thought Henry was... Wood died like a hero standing on his back so they wouldn't see me crawl back out in the world like a chimp
But you came back to Aldersolt to your old regiment post
Why is that? I just want to see my country one more time before I die
I saved every penny to buy a ticket home
I didn't know the regiment was stationed at Aldersolt
I only want to go where there's an army
I earned three meals a day by playing magic at a diner
I've given up the idea of killing Buckley and the flames of revenge have been dying for years until I met her
I think I still have to wear English clothes
Wearing this foreign dress all the time makes me look very funny
At first, I just wanted to find a thick coat, so I didn't have to look at the ladies who were distributing clothes
Then one of them came by
I recognized her on the horse
She hasn't changed a bit and she's still pretty
What's even more amazing is that she...
She looks like she still recognizes me
You want me to help you
Did you find any of your...
I don't think so.
Nancy, it's me. I'm Henry
Don't be afraid
I've been counting on you for 30 years
I am dead.
I never thought I'd see you again
We talked for a while
I told her about me
I should not have told her that her husband was a traitor, but I burst out with a vengeance that had held me back for thirty years
She was shocked at what I said
I can't bear to watch it
When I left, I saw her rushing out and FOLLOWED her to her house
I saw her enter the room and the light came on
I could see her sitting in a chair
Then he came in
James, I need to talk to you
-Lock the door for fuck's sake
- I told you not to be late, didn't I?
Are you in a relationship with someone
- No.
- You must be with someone!
Didn't have
Who is it?
You ruined my life
It's been so many years
How can you do this
- You evil devil
- Here's your tea, Mrs Buckley
I hate you hate you hate you hate you hate you
Don't
I saw him grab her body and I was so mad
I can't control my feelings
David, your tea wife
David you betrayed him
Is not the
He's alive. I told you I saw him
You are lying
Are you crazy
I've never seen anyone look at me the way he does
I saw death in his face
My life was like a bullet through his heart of guilt
Mrs. Barkley Mrs. Barkley open the door
He fell against the fence
She died before she fell
Mrs. Barkley Mrs. Barkley open the door
I took the key from Nancy's hand to open the door and call for help
But I think I'd better get going or things will be very unpleasant for me
I threw the keys in my pocket and went after Teddy who escaped from his cage and bit the curtain
Ty di
So the school died before he fell and hit the fence?
It must have been the wind of fright
Mr. Wood if the coroner finds the same Mrs. Buckley
Nancy will go free
I don't suppose you'd go back to the police and tell them what you just told them if you had anything to do with it?
Mr Holmes, how is Nancy
She's in the hospital
It won't be long before you're all over again
Thank god
How are you? It's so good to see you
Are you feeling better?
Yes, much better
Holmes there's something I don't quite understand
The colonel's James and Wood's Henry or Harry so who's David anyway
My good Watson, if I had been careful, I would have discovered that the name David would have told the whole story. Haven't you always thought I was good
But this time my reasoning powers failed
The name David in this case is actually a word of reproach
Responsibility for?
Do you remember King David of Israel? He fell in love with Bathsheba, the wife of General Uriah and sent her to the front to die so that he could claim bathsheba for himself
This story can be found in book I or II of Samuel
I'm afraid I've forgotten all about the Old date
You were right, Holmes
Samuel, book 2, chapter 11, 1-4, 17
Well, obviously you've done your homework since you came back from Aldersolt
How do you know that?
You used the bill from our dinner at Waterloo as a bookmark in the book, didn't you?
Severe Watson
Just getting started, dear Holmes
Good evening to an old friend
I must ask you to close the play now
Ok, thanks
Do you have any idea what this looks like?
It's like roller Coaster
You know what I mean?
Try to do it with me
How high is the London Eye?
How tall is Big Ben?
Since then, I have been working as a technical specialist for about two years
Very good
Cool.. can't get up
Does it look like a telephoto? And...
No, only on the net.
I shoot some films, but I mainly write about science and technology
Cool, great tech..
Where did you end up?
Travel like Indiana Jones?
Four parts of the mountain wading water, take risks to make difficult
In fact, my journey is not far off
But I first flew to Sydney and then Thailand
- really jealous
- India, yes
I went to Rome...
- I spent the whole vacation in Europe. - Even I didn't go that far
Is it true?
Very good
Then I went to Pamplona, Spain
- Isn't there a bull fight?
- Run with the cows
- You run with the cows?
- no wrong -
- That's how I got this wound
- not simple
You really are Indiana Jones
Do you have a leather whip in your bag? Is there a hat?
I saved the world from poison
That's kind of cool
I'm just... trying to do something I've never done before
Is that what this trip is all about? From me?
Yeah, well, in a way,
I....
It is my goal to leave home
Yeah, it's just... whatever, it's fine
I'm afraid there aren't many exciting places in England
It's the last stop on the tour
Unfortunately, I'm going home next week
- Not much time...
- the next week?
-yeah, we don't have much time
Give me something fun to do
- Something fun?
- to
The old days
You are good
Good morning..
Another scar
Is it
I guess you got hurt shark fishing in Cape Town, man
- Is that the best you can do with your American accent? - is the
The work of Josh Peters, the bad boy in high school
He and I were fighting in art class
He hit me with something like an iron bar
Is a bastard
"What a jerk."
- very don't like
- Sorry, is it yours or mine?
It must be yours
- "Mom," typical American
- is the
Aren't you going to answer it?
It's a little hard on you
You want to talk to her now?
You want to talk to my mom
- I can call her. - Okay
I don't think so
Are you hungry?
Look at these games
You're a gamer. That's right
I should be a working man
Have you ever been beaten by a girl in A whirling wind?
Is this... your date book?
What? "Different point"?
How can electroencephalography be more intelligent than men just as women were many years ago
What I do is like a joke
- You know what?
- is it?
- to
- Is that what you said?
Yeah, you got some of that in here
-Do you have some of that in here?
-yeah, there was
That's a funny joke.
Please enjoy your marmite
Oh my god
Do you really eat this stuff?
good
Okay, mom, mom saved me
The best way to stop her calling is...
I don't know. Answer it
I don't want to worry about all this right now
She is very worried about
You're her son
You've been traveling all this time, I just thought if you talked to her...
I'm still living with her in Syracuse
That's good. No question
I'm taking care of my dad
The dead
He...
No, he's dead
- day!
- Year, no, it doesn't matter
There was a drag
Early onset Alzheimer's disease
It must be very difficult
Yeah, he's my best friend
He looked at me sometimes, not knowing who I was
My mother... I never...
I don't know how to talk to her
I don't feel that way
I don't even know how to say it
This is why I went away
That's why I took this trip
In order to leave, while I can do my best to make memories
I knew I had to talk to her.
But not on a cell phone. I just... I'll take care of it
I'll deal with it when I get back. It's just...
You're a good man, Cooper
Call your mother
0, 0, 1, 9, 3, 9, 2, 9
No, I didn't buy sandals in Koh Samui last night because I was in...
How long will that take?
Because I want to buy a plane ticket back to America
My day,
Can I say this is the most shameless second encounter ever?
great
Oh, my God. Thank you.
Alright
-Don't forget your line of work
-All right, yeah
You're awesome I don't know what that means but I've heard people say you're awesome
I have a plan
Odd jobs
- For whom?
- It's a procedure
You can use... when I'm short of money
- Yes. - Some of them are interesting
"Looking for people who love you."
- Looks right up your alley. - Okay
Okay, four pounds. That's a lot of money. That's right
(Saito game) a little out of the way
Some kind of playtest, a company called Zitu..
Saito game... Yeah
Big companies
- It's really big. - Really?
entangled
Have you ever heard of...
What is that...
"Harlek's Ghost"?
Yes, I have
I used to hang out with my best friend David Lavey in his basement when we were in seventh grade
That's Saito
That's his company
- He's a genius. He's creative
-Well, apparently they're working on a new project
Put a large amount of capital into gold, empty before creating new
But keep it so tight that it doesn't leak
Maybe if I play my cards right I can give you exclusive access to Xiangyu
A family visit?
You should take a picture
Seriously, if you get any of the pictures they're planning you'll make a hell of a lot more than four pounds
That's a good idea
Where is the company located?
Mr. Cooper?
Just call me Cooper
I'm sorry, Mr. Cooper
Just call me Cooper
In that case, just call me Kitty
You're good.
-Follow me, please. -Okay
- I'll put my backpack in here
- Ralph will take care of it
Ralph will take care of it.
Very good
I don't want to carry it in
This reminds me of the demon King in the last level
You know, rising dragon boxing
- Along the way?
- Very nice, thank you
- Is the car ready to pick you up?
- full of meaning
This way, please
They are looking at...
Cool..
Quick point
I think I'm going to see Dumbledore
I hope I get assigned to Gryffindor House
Please take out your mobile phone and a device that can be used to transmit and receive messages
- Don't you feel a little spiritual?
- You can't be too careful
Ok, take it
You are a real soul
The white
Okay, SO I guess I'm a kidney donor?
This is a standard confidentiality agreement
You know that the small hand skills involved are very important
I'm sorry. Do you need it?
We, who are not permanent, will not steal your kidneys
I'm sure
It's like getting your ears pierced
"Machine secret capital material big brain under the load of the game, between the continuation of the end.."
What about the signature page?
Where do I sign my name?
Sign the name
There's a page missing. Hold on a second
Okay, I'll be right here... waiting
What the hell?
(What is the medical procedure?)
- All right?
- is very good
What we are working on is an augmented reality system
- Is an image a virtual reality?
- It's more real than real
- What is that?
- We call them "mushrooms."
- Like in super Mario Bros?
- You can say that if you want
- You have the talent for such things, don't you?
- I've never killed anyone before
Is that all right?
good
To complete the
- That's it?
-Look, tell me I'm a one-liner
Don't worry. It's not permanent
good
Is this some kind of memory test?
- You'll see
- Well, you may feel a slight tingling when you start
good
It starts at 5:38
- Are you ready?
- Yes, Sir
Fast ok
I turned off the phone for my sake
complete
How are you feeling?
I feel great
- Keep your eye on the target. - Okay
What do you see?
It's like...
It's like a gopher in a video game
- Are there more sections now?
-Right, right, right
- Where are you now?
- the death
To die, it is in..
May I touch it?
It's not real,
It's some kind of psychological reflection
- You can see it
I can't see
- Can't you see?
Is....
All right
Hitting it
Hit it with force? good
All right, it's like whack-a-Mole
I've played it a million times. Okay
good
began
Come on
Where are you coming from?
Where did you go?
Okay, don't come up
good
It's so fun... you're so cute
-All right, see you later
Didn't it?
-Fear is like this
Ground squirrels are flat or vertical
No, livers, super livers, like...
- This is only a limited test demonstration
- That's just a demonstration?
I think you should have a look at the whole system we are developing
Pay more if you are interested
I have an interest in...
This is Saito Shoyu
-you must be our newest volunteer
- you are good
This is really great. You're good.
I mean, that whole game was super fun
Good play?
It's good to have fun
It's good to play games
The heart beats faster
- And a smile. - Yeah
Yeah, or... Scream (Harlek's Ghost)
I'd like to make the players jump
frightened
They jump when they get scared
- You'll feel better afterwards. - Yeah
What do you light up for?
This is due to hyperstimulation of suprrenal adenine
- Yeah. - Yeah
But it will be for your sake that the Lord lives
Your deepest fears in the realm of safety
This is the release of fear. It will free you
Yeah, that's right
What we're working on right now is the most personal life horror show in history
It's great to scare you with your own thoughts
Sounds... crazy
Can't wait
- I'm uploading a network packet
- God net road closure..
It may take a little time to figure out what happened in 1990
It's funny. It's a good name
This is the most advanced smart software
It learns quickly and ADAPTS
Monitor your brain activity and try to identify the things that scare you the most and then adjust your experience accordingly
- Are you ready? - ok
- Here we go. Okay, ready to go
- Close your eyes
- The current time is 6:17 p.m
Are uploading
Five, four, three, two, one
How do you feel?
- It feels good
It is normal
Stand up slowly
Are you ready to start the game?
This isn't the house of "Harlek's Ghost"?
This is a portion of the land
In fact, it was the gamekeeper's hut. It was the exact model
According to the game as a copy of the grid, sweep the structure
Not often cool..
What kind of game is this? What am I supposed to do?
You don't have to do anything
Just stay in here alone and see how long you can last until you're scared out of your wits
So I'm just gonna stay in here? You get paid?
I'll take a look in the control room at the back
There are cameras everywhere, no stealing silver tableware
And this
- What is this?
- the intercom
Yes, we can hold the connection for the whole journey
Can I talk to you and you'll hear me?
great
Nothing you see can hurt you
It's all visual and auditory effects of whack-a-Mole
Very good
But if it turns out to be too much we'll let you out at any time
- Stop testing
- Okay, have you thought about keeping the lights dark?
Easy to remember words under pressure?
- How about "stop"?
- Good choice,
Then stop
All right, well, let's just let you enjoy the night
Good -
- You'll hear my voice when you wait
- Make yourself at home in here
- Okay, not too hard
Halek's Ghost
Is it true?
Yeah, I'm really dead.
- library parker
- you are good
- Can you hear me?
- One clear and two clear
Already trying to take courage out of it
- No, those wines don't contain alcohol
- good bad
- We need you to stay awake
- makes sense
This is a really good, bad technique
A stream of carpenters
- So it's right here
- The observation is amazing
There you go
- the death
- What's wrong?
I just forgot I didn't have my phone
I kept looking. I forgot it was in my mouth pocket
There's no TV in here
Welcome to the 19th century without electricity, network and wire network
It's hard to blame them for seeing dirt
It may be all hallucinations
This is the principle of seeing ghosts
The mind can be confused when it is not stimulated by the outer world
The fewer distractions people have the more ghosts they see
That's a good tip
But there are books to read
Still close to the heart
God, I can't remember the last time I read a book
People who think of the past will also take books to read
I know. It's crazy. Why?
-you know, I feel like...
- All right, I'm gonna go over it,
It takes concentration to think
May I say your heart is beating faster?
As it should, because there's a big spider
You see a spider?
- Don't you see?
- didn't have
Don't walk over here.
- to life
- You're a tough guy who's afraid of spiders?
I don't like spiders
The system quickly found out that you have a spider phobia
It's poking at your weakness
It's time to go to hell
This is way more real than whac-a-Mole
It's great. It's real
Well, yes
Okay, that's not scary enough
What's the matter?
It's just... it's nothing... it's like...
No, there's a light on...
Can you pull the tip of the mirror in here?
So you know what I'm talking about
- library parker
- There are now..
There was a man at the window
It's not...
He's out of sight now
There's no one at the window now
This is...
Yes, it is.
It's just the pipes leaking water
I know it
It's the pipe leaking water
To die
The dead
good
You're scaring me.
- What do you see?
- Weird people
No... oh, my God. Oh, my God
He looks just like Josh Peters
-you're Josh Peters.
- what?
You're Josh Peters from high school
My high school friend
The system can dig up some of your personal memories
Was Josh Peters the guy you were afraid of in high school?
He's a bully. I'm not afraid.
I'm not afraid of him, but he's a bully.
God, if I take a few more Israeli close quarters I'll be ready.
I'll be ready for it
The card Lima
I'm going to have some wine
I'll give you a drink but I don't think you can handle it
See you later, Peters
This dry wine is quite good to drink
I'm no expert, but this is good stuff
I've been to France
We live in a vineyard and we have a wine that we offer at the Grape Festival
That wine is really good, I know
You're rambling
- What is this bullshit?
- health talk
Idle talk
Is this a question?
Some people talk more than others when they are afraid
Enough to make up for the fear
- Can also mask fear. - Really?
It's like turning on TV at night
The sound will make you feel more alone
So that you only have one person
You can't scare me, Kitty
What a pity
- Do they have ice boxes?
- There are some snacks in the cupboard
All right, point pawns will point to...
You. All right, all right. Gingerbread cookies
I have a look at
Also good
This one will do
I close the door and he shows up behind me, right?
Yes, that's the rule
Has long been known that
The sudden shock is no longer enough
Damn day!
- What the hell is that?
- What do you see?
There is enough
One...
It's hard to explain
A man with a big face that said that
It's... Peters is in...
It's like a cross between Peters and a spider
Jesus, Kitty, is this your trick or my hallucination?
I think it's your vision
I'm so messed up
Old day, can evil
You deserve to die. You have a bad heart
I'm sorry, but could you say it again?
Hello, Kitty?
Damn it, Kitty.
Just say when you get on the line
You know I'm not afraid, just not talking
Is that you?
Want to trim your ear?
That could be a good idea
The dead
Open it
Do you have a dangerous
Sonia chang ya?
That's more like it
Pretty amazing
There's a whole set of them
I am deeply impressed by my...
You look so real
You look just like her
Shirley harm
I'm just sorry you're not
- Cooper, what are you doing?
- Cooper, you're in danger
-Ann... I need to think
You are so real.
-Cooper, do you...
- Sonya, you're really here
- Are you really in here?
-i'm real. I'm really in here
We must go away
You must listen to me
What are you doing in here?
Do you remember that photo you sent me?
I looked into it. Apparently, Saito filed a patent last year for a computer-brain interaction system
How can you be real? I don't...
Good, but bad.
They brought you here
You're real. They brought you here. They wanted to mess with me.
I understand.
This is part of the test
His exclusive interest was rejected by the court
They said it was crazy and dangerous
Isn't it? How much do they pay you?
Really, because you were so good
Cooper, did they give you something?
I'm sorry. I thought you were fake
But now that I know you're real, I didn't do you any favors
I have some dry wine
Maybe it'll give us a break
Cooper, what I want to do is...
- We'll talk in the kitchen
- library parker
Sonia, just take it easy, okay?
Drop it. You're showing your face. Cut it out
Look, Cooper, it's not over yet
Five people went missing last year
They're all light watchers and they're all logged in with that stupid printer
Isn't it? That's terrible
It doesn't matter what they're doing to you or what they've done to you
It's dangerous. We really should go, Cooper
Well...
-If what you say is true...
- library parker
- Then how did you find me?
- what? How do you know about this?
This is Game Company. I got a location
Isn't it?
No... how did you find me here? This place
I followed you. - You followed me?
- Yeah, use the satellite on your phone
"Find my friend" works...
Sounds like a good idea but they took my phone
And the land was about one and a half kilometers from here
That's the right move, Gaoming
Stop saying that women are smarter than men and "different" is wrong
Look, I'm just saying
You should be able to come up with better stories that are funny, or...
Okay... don't get mad
Have you ever wondered why your bank account was attacked?
What are you doing?
I'll duplicate your card while you're asleep
Okay, put the knife down. What are you doing with it?
I let you get this job by accident
Sonia, will you put that fucking knife down?
It's not funny
You should have called your mother, Cooper
- But you called me and I led you here
- You know what?
- Surface coating path
Put the knife down
Immediately stop
Okay, seriously, put the knife down, Sonia
It's not funny at all
Put the knife down
That's not what I'm talking about
I don't want to play anymore, can I?
The dead
Make what?
- Cooper, what's going on?
What happened just now?
What's the matter?
We've been on the phone all along
- You haven't answered
-you said I wouldn't feel anything
What do you see?
What's in there?
- Oh, no, she's gone
- Who hasn't?
Oh, my God, I can feel it
There's a knife in my arm
- Into my shoulder
-Cooper, who's been there?
- Damn it, Sonia
- who?
Sonya, she's the girl I know the fucking.
She stabbed me
- She's got a knife
- Nothing can hurt you, Cooper
- No, she's a real person
- No, she can't be
She... I got stabbed
I know that
Nothing you see can hurt you or touch you
This is a visual and auditory effect
- No physical sense
- Well, evil is always there
- Cooper, you have to calm down
- I know, because I feel it, you know?
I felt her arm, it was hot and I felt her thrust into my shoulder
- That's not gonna happen. - Oh, my God
- That's impossible, Cooper
-Is there any way...
Physical awareness should not develop
- Except for... - God,
Except what? I don't know.
God can find some ways of replicating the actual body
- But this is a first
- Oh, my God. You know what? End the game
I'm going out. Let me out of the saddle
Stop... Safe and dark
Stop the dead
-All right, let's go over this
To my days
No, I'm getting out of this shit right now
Cooper, do not try to remove it yourself
Automatic extraction is extremely dangerous
Hold your hands. This could get you killed
Keep calm
Is it Saito?
Is it Saito?
What did he say...
We will begin to solve
The good news
We want you to meet us according to the instructions
Rendezvous points?
Too good
Where's the meeting place for the dead?
- Damn it, there's a stairway?
Thanks to Joe
-Just one more floor
- believe me
Top left
- Okay, which door?
- The bottom room
What's the matter?
There's something behind that door. I can feel it
- It's like...
- Like what? Some of one's worst memories
It's like... I don't know, but I can feel it digging into my brain
Cooper, open the door
It must be my mom I don't know. She's dead
- your mother?
- Swing from the davit
- Your mother's not in it
It's not like you can control it
In my head, it all knows.
- it knows
- Does it know what?
He knew I had feelings for my mother
Cooper, I assure you she's not in there
- I'm on my way to the door. - Oh, my God
It's the only way I can get you out of here
Take my advice..
The dead
There is nothing inside that can harm you
But I can't let you out of here until you open the door, Cooper
-Would you please open the door?
-Come on.
All right, I'm in my room
Where is the meeting point?
Rendezvous points?
- There's no meeting point
- what?
I was playing you, Cooper
I just want to see if you're screwed enough by us to do exactly what we say
- Looks like it worked
- No, Kitty, please let me out
Kitty, let me out, please. What the hell?
What are you going to do?
What are you doing to me?
-Why do you want to do this?
- You thought you'd meet your mother
- the death
- What does she look like?
Your mother, can you make her look good?
Her hair color?
Is she tall, short, fat or thin?
Where did you grow up?
Which band do you like best?
What flavor of ice cream do you like best?
What was the name of the girl who stabbed you?
You didn't know any of this, did you?
Don't you find it strange?
- It's taking my memories
- Remolding, technically
- Ugh. - Look at the mirror behind you
Do you know who you are?
Do you know who you think you are?
You'll soon be nothing
You'll be just like your dad
-Shut up.
- Is that what you're afraid of?
- You're stepping in his dust
Shut your mouth..
- You're not going anywhere
-Shut up.
You should have called your mother
She is all you have
- You abandoned her
Get out of my head
You'll never see your mother again
You're not going anywhere. You're forgotten
You should have -- you should have called her horse and gotten out of my head
Cooper, I'm gonna shut it down, okay?
I just need the wire
Where am I?
Who are you?
I can't stop it
I don't know who I am
So I'm going home
