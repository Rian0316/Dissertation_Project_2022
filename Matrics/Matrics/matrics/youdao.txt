There's a waiter under the building.
Tell him to wait, Mrs Hudson
He is always in a hurry
Slowly slowly
I must apologize
I'm a little bit overworked
I'm a doctor and I'm going to ask you to relax until you've eaten something
Xie xie
If I could have a cookie and a glass of milk
I'm sure it'll be all right soon
Mrs Hudson is cooking now
Please forgive me for my weakness
I really have to.
Mr Holmes
For your effect Lao Art master
Ph.D.
The headmaster of an Abbey school
It's not every day Dr. Hackstabb
Famous fugitives like you lie on the carpet in front of my hearth
I'd like to guess what brings you here
I took the liberty of searching you in the hope that you would forgive me
Oh, yes, yes, of course
Please have a seat
You watch
It's been at least 30 years and it's been scratched this morning
When you unthinkingly shoved those hard coins into your pocket
Immutable habits are left behind
It may be a small thing but I think it looks like a quivering needle from a certain Angle
I may also show you a tremor in your stubble to show that your daily habits have been heavily influenced
Is it three days already?
Yes, Mr.
Yes, Sir, Mr Holmes, I beg you to follow me north to Maccleston at once
matters
Oh I'm sorry
Mr. Watson and I are extremely busy at the moment
I have my hands full with the Ferrer papers
And Dr. Watson told me that the recent outbreak of scarlet fever has kept him off the ground
And of course there's the Abel Caveney murder trial coming up
Now it's only ten big questions that can keep us away
"Significant," Mr.?
Did you say "heavy"?
Surely you have heard of Lord Hudnith?
The former cabinet minister?
It's not just that, Watson.
His head titles almost took up half of the alphabet
One of the king's greatest subjects hi, Dr. Hakestabb?
The greatest is also one of the richest
I am proud to say that he is still my neighbour
Hudnaith House -- his great country house was just across the river valley from the convent
The Duke was a very solitary man
He was afraid that the public would ask questions about it, but he was so anxious that he saw that it would be settled that he offered five thousand pounds and another thousand pounds in the hope that the bad man would be caught in the net
That's how big it is
That's a lot of money for Dr. Hackstabb
But you haven't talked about the case yet
Oh, please forgive me
The Duke's only son, Lord Saltell, has been kidnapped!
Tied up in a convent school?
Is the
Under your watch?
Was the harness born three days ago?
Last Saturday night
Then why did you wait so long to find me?
The Duke was always afraid that his family's bad fortune would be made public
The Duke asked the police to act with caution - as they did.
- I'm clear
It was a very unseemly affair
I also feel that I have been somewhat improper in admitting it
By what means was the ransom money raised?
There was no offer of redemption
There's no redemption money?
Didn't have
This is one of the most puzzling aspects of the whole thing because this boy didn't walk out on his own
Mr. Heidegger our German teacher is missing too
And by the way, his cart is gone, too
If he was the one who bound the boy, why has he not yet received any ransom claims?
Heidegger came from Switzerland with the best recommendation
Are there any other vehicles missing?
Oh no
Are you sure?
Yes, Mr. Evelyn checked all the bikes
Dr. Hakstabb are you saying that the German teacher rode away on her bicycle in the middle of the night with this boy in her arms?
Don't
What do you have to say about that?
A single car may be just a mask
He may have hidden the car somewhere and then the two of them walked away
No doubt he could have hidden a few wagons if he had wanted to make that impression
I think so
Of course he could, Dr. Hackstabb your whole "cover-up" thing doesn't hold water
But that's for the investigation
It's a good start Watson, will you send for a carriage immediately?
Now, Holmes?
Pick up and pack in each position
We still have plenty of time to catch the night train from Sympancras
Dr. Hackstabb I'm going to your place to do some research
There might still be some clues that an old hound like Watson and I could sniff out
I suppose it would be a great honour for you to have Sir Saltell at your school?
Mr Holmes, it was published after Blackwell
The proudest moment I've had since Hakstabb's View of Horace, which was a great success at the time
You may have heard of it
Didn't have
How old is the boy?
Nine,
How long have you been studying there?
As soon as the winter school season began, school came
A boy who is not in the right place seems right
He, uh...
What's the matter?
All I'm saying is he's not very happy at home
The duke's marriage was not an easy one
His marriage last year ended in separation after mutual agreement
The Duchess returned to Venice to live in her father's mansion
How do you know all this about the duke's marriage?
Is it something everyone knows?
I have had several private conversations with Mr Wilder who is the Duke's secretary
He's very helpful
I assume you have established that the boy did not go to Italy to return to his mother?
Oh yes
Yes, I can't tell you... Mr. Holmes... -i feel so relieved...
- China life? !
- is coming! -Here are the starters
Mrs Hudson, how did you guess?
Experience, Mr Holmes
Uh, doc and Doc can eat as much as they want in the car
The air in the wilderness is so invigorating that I may find myself having a better stomach for a few days
I think it would be appropriate for me to say that monasteries are the first preparatory school in England
Lord Levaststock, Earl of Blackwater cathcart. Sir Soames
Send their children to me
You can't see Hudnaith House from here, but you can see it clearly from the tower of the chapel
I'm gonna start with the boys 'room
Is it from his dad?
He was lost when the morning came
Has he received any letters from Italy?
Have not been recently
Where is the letter from his father now?
I can't find it
The boy should have been on his body when he was strapped
Who lives in a compartment?
- - No, you don't have to arrest - - I dare say I've solved this kind of family
Even if it is lightning thunder can also shout shout big sleep
He won't
Is it true? Why?
There was an old rat born in the wall
Woke us both up
Old rat?
So any sound from Lord Saltel's room...
Uh, the door creaked first
We can always hear the door
Did you hear anything when he disappeared the night before?
There is no Mr.
You can't even hear a cry
Cry cry?
Yes, Mr.
He sometimes cries
There is time to wait for the first
Thank you kids
Didn't you find anything on the ground?
Did not find
The traces are all gone
The school long!
The school long!
Lord Hudness is here headmaster
Thank you, Mr. Evelyn
Mr Holmes?
well
The Duke is waiting for Mr Holmes
It's useless to say this one
The duke of adults
Mr. Wilder
I called you yesterday Dr. Hackstabb
But it's too late to stop you from leaving for London
The Duke was surprised to find Dr. Haakstubb
I can't believe you invited Mr. Holmes to investigate without first consulting your lordship
Well, I think the police are out of their depth.
The police should be... absolutely right is not powerless
Yes, but Mr. Wilder...
You must have noticed how anxious Lord Dr. Hackstabb was to avoid public scandal
He hoped that as few people knew about it as possible
I'm sorry, Mr. Wilder
The matter is easily remedied
Mr Holmes could catch an early train back to London
No, no, no, no
I love the way you feel in the air
I reckon I'll spend at least a few days in your wilderness
Who knows if there's nothing else maybe we'll find Mr. Heidegger's bike
This is no small matter, Mr Holmes
I'm glad you don't think so
Mr Holmes if you mean anything
I'm afraid I didn't hear you clearly
Your only son is missing
Your hope that you have not come to your high family are facing the threat of disillusionment
What do you think is...?
I would like to know your son's sexual life or his name
What does prudence count for?
But is also allowed to answer the case is not the continuation of the glory can count what?
But I believe you are right to a great extent, Mr Holmes
If you're referring to my efforts to limit the actions of the police, then I may have put too much influence on them
I have a sickly fear of public relations
James if Mr Holmes is here we'd be fools not to ask for his help
Mr Holmes?
The big man?
Perhaps you would like to come and live with us at Hudness House?
Thank you, Sir, but I think it would be wiser for the investigation to keep me at the scene of the case
You casually
Either Mr. Wilder or I will provide you with the assistance you need
May I ask if you have your own views on the mysterious disappearance of your son?
No, no, no, no
He's a good boy, Mr Holmes
How long has he been in your class?
Since the day he got here
Did he talk a lot about his family?
Don't often talk
I think he feels a little resentful about his mother and the way his father acted
Did he ever talk about the separation of the duke and his husband?
Didn't have
There's some mystery to this
The boy insisted that they loved each other very much
Don't you see that he's trying to comfort himself?
No, he's a very old, solid kid
Oh, but his family is not very old
Someone told me they were members of the Hellfire Club.
I don't suppose you know what time Mr. Heidegger returned to his room on the night of his disappearance?
No, it's not too late
After eleven o 'clock
He was the duty teacher that night
I think he can ride a bike, right?
Yes, oh, yes
Did Lord Saltell ride with him?
No, he hasn't learned how to balance
I don't suppose you happen to know the brand of Mr. Heidegger's bicycle tires?
Of course know
A lovely bike from Brightman
The tires are Palmer you know the ones with the stripes
I know that
Xie xie
You've been a great help
You're welcome, Mr Holmes.
Dinner is served at eight o 'clock
I'm sorry
Holmes?
I've grown to like this case, Watson
There are certain points of interest in this case
Look at this map
Some of the characteristics of the soil are closely related to our investigation
This black square is the convent School
This is a main road with no turnouts for a mile on either side
The ground potential on the north side of the school rises slowly
To the south is a large ploughed field with many high walls and hedgerows
It's impossible for a driver to pass
Oh, what did you find in Oakburn?
Police received reports from various parts of the area that a man was seen with a boy
This morning we wrapped up a survey of the area
Is there any fruit?
nothing
The reported characteristics of the elephant did not kiss the boy nor the German teacher
great
The number of false eyewitness reports and Watson confirms my suspicions
I don't think they went far enough
It must be right to seek solitude
I don't think they went that far
But a single car?
A good driver is a Watson who doesn't need a good road
The wilderness is divided into patches by small tracks
I remember it was a full moon
The man we're looking for is to the north
You did the right thing, Watson
You'll be delighted to hear that dinner will be served soon but there's one more thing I need to clear up
Mr. Heidegger's room
Just ten minutes
Dr. Holmes is working on the origins of the Hudnais family
Like many families of old, they don't have a very clean history
Not clean, doctor?
Well, they're just cattle rustlers without a degree of sensitivity
Brave, wise, resourceful, and bold, it is impossible for them to make their first fortune from other people's cattle
Holmes even told me that Hudnaith was once named a mad member of the Hellfire Club
What's wrong with you, Dr. Hackstabb?
There's nothing
Obviously there is something wrong
I think my expectations were too high
It's a part-time job after all
Tell me what you want
I'm not looking for anything weird
I don't think I'm a person who wants to find something strange... but you haven't found anything
We haven't found anything since we left London
This is not true, though
Well, you found out about both of those things
One is a dirty word and the other is a false and slandering image of my great client's family
Mr Holmes I did not hire you here to bring the name of the Hudnaith family into disrepute
Keep it cool and quiet
As a matter of fact, we have already found out
I can give you a detailed account of what passed on that fateful night at the school
And what your wonderful and loyal German teacher did
Was Heidegger loyal?
What are you talking about?
Mr. Heidegger retired to his room shortly after eleven
He is a late day teacher
Now my friend and colleague Dr. Watson will simulate his actions
Heidegger was on duty for another two hours that night and another hard day
He decided to let himself loose and took off his jacket
Then he went to the counter by the door and poured himself a glass of sherry
He occasionally needs a drink to meet his duties
He took his candle and sat down at the table to review his work, which included not only grammar but also a long composition
You know what I'm gonna say, Dr. Hackstabb
If he's not doing anything else
His candle should be snuffed out just after noon and night
The candle was in the cupboard by the door
He got up from the table and reached for another candle, but it was black and he could not find it
So he went to the window and drew the curtain aside to see more clearly by the moonlight
On the roof of the tower opposite the gate the boy was waiting for the moon to come pale and he knew that no one would see him flee
Mr. Heidegger watched as the boy hurried over the ridge to the river for his appointment
He felt the importance of what was unfolding
Heidegger ran for the door and knocked over the rest of his sherry glass
I've learned
Xie xie
It seems that I was wrong about you
It was not wise of him to chase after a boy
I don't think he's alive or dead
I beg your pardon, Mr Holmes
You mean...
I hope it is not so, but if it be the truth of my reasoning that I am truly concerned for him
What about the child?
Bosch is the thread of this affair
Is out in the
It's on the other side of the Zhuofu Bridge
Pity the beast
The raven
They've given up their reputation by pretending that the boy was taken away on horseback, haven't they?
Don't wrong
Otherwise Heidegger wouldn't need a bike to chase him
But all we found were cow tracks, Holmes
Holmes? Holmes?
A car rut hua Sheng!
A rut
Is it a single train?
Of course it is a single car is not the single car
I am familiar with 42 different single wheel tread tracks
This is a Dunlop with a patched outer tire
Heidegger had Palmer tires
These aren't Heidegger's ruts. Whose are they?
Whose is it at the end?
China!!
These are palmer's wheels that mark heidegger's path
This is so unusual
The ruts of the Dunlop stretched 150 yards
And the wheel marks of palmer's plate were clearly directed towards these rocks, but they had disappeared
And there's no sign of a horse anywhere
Watson, your ability to see the obvious is remarkable
I should have brought some lunch
What exactly is Mr. Heidegger riding after
The cows?
They can't strap boys to the back of cows
All traces of the horses were wiped out
It was easy to see that the two vehicles just flew away
Can't be
Just because we made a mistake can't be
So in one respect we should be wrong
At the other end of the wilderness there was a sign of the inn
Holmes had a hotel on the chesterfield road
Yes, if we follow this route we'll go to the hotel
Uh, I thought I'd get some luck in there
I'm hungry
Holmes?
Lunch is a dear friend you should be starving to death
I'm looking at the map now
You'll see a hotel about three miles from here
We need some if we're going to face Lord Hudnaith again
Didn't you get anything?
If I find nothing, I must tell the great man
No takers?
nothing
I'm sorry
I'm sorry
locked
These forged pictures are rough but full of vividness
Mr. Ruben Hayes?
How do you know my name?
It's right on the door
We're looking for something to eat
Is it?
We'd be thrilled if you could find us something to eat
Is it?
Is the
You'll have to ask that woman
An annoying family member
If we have to make it all the way back to Hudness House this afternoon
Then hire some horses
How do you feel?
How far are you going to ride them?
Go to the Duke's house and come back I say you know the way?
I worked there for 15 years
Well, you can ride them
I said Mr. Hayes did you hurt yourself?
It doesn't matter
I'm a doctor and I assure you it's not gonna be easy
You should see a doctor about it
How did you get hurt?
One of my dogs did it
Those are scratches
What's the matter?
Well, a closer look shows how far apart they are
What kind of animal could create a scratch like that?
Maybe a descendant of champion Jack.
The law has banned chicken fighting for 50 years
The law forbids many things
What law is there in a land like this?
Oh, that's great, Mrs. Hayes. Thank you
What are you cooking?
Blood pudding, sugar and grain
Well, Watson?
Disgusting holmes
That woman... why is she more scared than her husband
Then two in a row three deceit
What do you want to hide?
Deceives tricked?
Oh, Watson
My horse is lame
It's strange
The horseshoe is old, but the nail is new
Gentlemen.
The big man is here to see you
Oh, Mr. Wilder
Mr Holmes, Dr Watson, welcome to Hudness House
He'll be right there on his horse
We have high hopes for your talents, Mr Holmes
Did you bring anything with you?
There's just one thing I need to clear up
What is it, Mr Holmes?
This concerns the duke's grave concerns
I might be able to help you as a great man's secret
I think the elder man wrote a letter to his son right after the accident
No, it wasn't the day before it happened
It is true that the letter comes when the day comes
Yeah, it could be
Was there anything in the letter that would encourage the boy to run away?
Oh, I don't think so
He was running back to this place anyway
Or to his mother in Italy?
No, Sir
Even if the German had instigated him Lord Saltel would have realized
That's impossible. He's a sensible, down-to-earth boy
But he would cry in his sleep
Are letters sent by adults themselves? People are not used to sending letters
The letter was lying on the desk with the others and I had put it there myself
The only other person who had access to the mail was Reeves who delivered the daily mail to the mailroom
Are you sure the letter was in there?
Oh yes
I noticed what did you find, Mr Holmes?
How's your research going?
Are you trying to disappoint me?
I wish I could make people more open and I could be a little richer
So what did you find out?
The Lord has some questions to clarify
I think a prior covenant lured a boy out of school and I suspect his mother was used as bait
The German teacher spotted him leaving and went out in pursuit
It was with great difficulty that we found his single wheel rut in the wilderness
It's like all the traces... have been erased by someone.
Mr Holmes?
Someone who drives a herd of cattle
Do you know the herd of cattle in the wilderness.
What happened to the cows?
I hope you haven't seen the cows
The weather on our high land is not suitable for cattle grazing in winter
They had to wait at least two weeks before they could leave the barn
Then I'm really blind
Thank you for your honor
Old shoe, new shoe!
Old shoe, new shoe!
Holmes, you should see this!
Of really let a person imprint elephant deep engrave! Nail the horse with a hoof-print that covers your ears!
Have you seen the horseshoes?
I saw the men who took Lord Saltell pin different horseshoes to their horses to avoid being tracked
Reuben Hayes draws on a piece of local history
Oh, no, Watson, no
The north vulture points to the square
German teacher
Look what's left of his body!
You are good!
You are good! You are good!
The skin and blood
Only a microscope can tell if it is not humanoid
This is definitely consistent with the scratch marks on Hayes 'neck
Oh yes, what was the cause of death?
Le kill
His throat was shattered
The shepherd will take us to the convent to tell us of this unfortunate news
We must advance on foot, Watson
When I was one step away!
Like a kid trying to figure out a puzzle in that bar!
But every step I take, MY back goes off the line
How do I know where to put the body?!
It's over, Arthur
Ruben Hayes
I hope we're not too late
There are patches on the outer tire of the Dunlop
What's going on here, Mrs. Hayes?
I'm glad you don't like the idea of coercion
Someone picked up the boy
Mr Wilder, the Duke's secretary?
Which way did they go?
Cross the wilderness?
To their hideout on chesterfield Road
Excellent, Mrs. Hayes
I must marry A warlord's son
You are now the angel of the male child
I saw the big man's ticket on the table
I'd be delighted if you could write me a note for ￡6,000
It would have been better if you had drawn a line across it.
The Oxford Street Branch of urban-rural Bank is my agent
It is not in my nature, Mr Holmes, not to appreciate such a tart joke even though it clearly pleases you
I'm sorry but I don't understand that James is Mr. Wilder
How could you get involved in this and you have no proof of it
But I have the evidence in my hand and it is ironclad
The mud is still wet from the horseshoes in your display cabinet
Why do you doubt what I say?
You seem to have smeared it
Your gain will be destroyed by your foolish wisdom
There are pictures of you and your father in his youth in the great hall
All have obvious family characteristics
How long has Mr. Wilder worked for you?
What do you mean by that?
How dare you!
You don't know!
You are a rude man!
You will never... please get off the horse!
I won't.
I....
Then my suspicions were right
Mr. James Wilder is your son
When I was very young, Mr Holmes
I fell in love with that kind of love for once in my life
I proposed to the lady and she turned me down on the grounds that such an alliance would ruin my business
I'm sure I wouldn't marry anyone else if she were still alive until she's gone
There was only one child left James for whom I nursed and nurtured
I cannot openly acknowledge our paternity, but I still treat him as my own son in any other way
He pleaded with me several times, but he could not get his testimony, and I forgave him
To forgive
Too many times
Oh, my Lord has done his best with Mr. Wilder
You must realize that he was not impressed by your words
He plotted to kidnap Lord Saltell
No talk is so many mistakes without a heart
He is always a conspirator and must be found! Before he plans to commit more serious crimes
He must be found! Before you lose your last son
Reeves?
You organize a search of the wilderness
Along the west side of the forest from the temple courtyard to the pavilion
Call every man in the house and not one of them will be left behind
You find my son Lord Saltell
If you find Mr. Wilder please hold him and bring him back to me
Wilder intercepted your letter and wrote another note and replaced it to fool your son into believing that he would meet his mother
Hayes was his paid accomplice but the police have been notified
Hayes can't get away with it
China life?
I followed them to the wilderness but they didn't see me
I've searched the whole area but they look like they've been swallowed
I looked into your family history
I seem to have mentioned a huge limestone cave for the storage of stolen cattle
The cathedral!
Quick point!
Come on!
Hand him over to me
No! You're not gonna get him!
- the father kisses! - Come on, father!
Father kisses!
Father kisses!
James!
My love for Francesca is not a boyish passion but a man's love
My marriage to her provoked jealousy from James
I could see his mother's face and lift on his body
James knew he could stop me from loving my wife
In spite of his cruelty to Arthur
I can't kick him out just yet
So I sent Arthur away instead
What did he hope to achieve by tying up his brother?
Money?
The ground position of the law?
There is power
I have power over me
He was flattered that he could ride over me and he knew that I had refused to give him power
But did you ever suspect that he was the master of the harness?
I have thought of it in my darkest hour
Somehow I hoped I could save him
Well, it's like a long, long redemption
My only hope is that Francesca will forgive me
Thank you, Mr Holmes
Big man..
This is a ransom for the king.
You gave me back my absence
Bohemian scandal
Got you!
Look at it.
It's a man!
Go close the window. J, O, H, N
Sherlock Holmes always addressed her as "the woman." He vaguely remembered the beautiful Irene. Adler
At the beginning of the Irene Adler case
Holmes and I have shared Baker Street for some years
I went out of the country for medical treatment and stayed a few days before I came back
Usually some time after leaving Holmes
I have to get used to his weird spleen
Oh!
Oh, hello, Mrs Hudson
Dr Watson, you are almost wet through in your state!
Yeah, it's not a big deal
I was waiting for a cart to stand full time in the rain for 20 minutes
That's not good for your old wound
I know that
Give me your coat and hat and I'll dry them for you
Mrs Hudson I haven't eaten all day
It would be nice if we could get dinner here quickly
I don't know. I wonder what happened to Mr. Holmes. It's like he's on gun poison
I can't bring dinner until he calls me
It was his order
Thank you, Mrs Hudson
My dear Holmes
What was it injected tonight? Is coffee or cocaine?
I can strongly recommend to you 7 % cocaine solution
Would you like to try it on?
I won't try!
I'm here to speak not just as a friend but as a doctor
How can you destroy your gift of excelling others with a quick feeling? !
I can't tell you how it brightens my brain
That's right, but it also destroys your brain!
My brain will turn upside down if I have nothing to do
Give me a difficult problem to do for me to do the deepest secret code to do the most complex analysis work for me to feel the most comfortable
I don't need to be prodded
I have often detested plain living
What I seek is spiritual excitement
So it may be said that I have created this particular vocation by choosing it, and that I am the only person in the world who has done it
The only private investigator?
The only private consultant to investigate
I didn't take credit for it
This is my unrequited recompense, the joy of my work, the exertion of my special powers
You can close that drawer
You have the wrong idea, doctor!
There's something here that excites me
I hope you have a good day abroad
It's good for your stomach
You know, I was really hoping you could order dinner
What is this?
That's right. I need to be ready for the reception
This came in this morning
Tell me what you think
No date, no signature, no address
Good. Read it loud
"Dear Mr. Holmes."
"The contemptible will be visiting this evening at 7:03pm."
Oh, my God. We only have a few minutes, Holmes
Continue to read
"What matters most to the contemptible," "he will consult with his court."
"Your recent service to the Royal family of Europe indicates that you have been entrusted to undertake..." "... Things too big to say..."
"Well, you can count on it." "This kind of beauty is well known in all quarters."
It's... it's a very secret thing
What do you think that means?
I haven't got anything to go on
Adding a tweet before that is a big no-no
well
But from the body of the word can you deduce what from it?
It must have been the handwriting of some forefather
Very good
It is probable that he has money
This paper should be very expensive
Paper quality is particularly firm and stiff
Those are the two words that are special
This is not a piece of paper made in England at all
Hold it up and look into the light
Ah, a big E and a small G big P and g and a small T interwoven together
Do you know what tao means?
The maker's print
Hello Watson!
Come on!
Let us ask the continental gazetteer
Here's your solani. You see, I didn't mean to forget you came back
Oh Holmes!
Would you like a glass of Whiskey? I'd like to have some later for dinner
This is P A P I R G E S E L L S C H A F T which means "paper factory" in German
As for E g.. E g L o w.. E g L o n I t z there is E G r I a, a German-speaking region of Bohemia famous for its glass factories and
The brim of paper mills is famous for the Bohemian kingdom
This note was written by a German
Only a German could use a verb like this
The guest to come is a German from Bohemia
He went to a covered carriage drawn by two horses
The Watson case, if nothing else, is profitable
Holmes, I think your client would want me gone
I don't know how you're gonna stay in here!
I would be at a loss without my own Bothwell. Assistant Johnson)
But he seems to want to keep it a secret
I could use your help and he could do the same
Just sit here in this armchair and listen to us
He is coming
No, Sir, you can't break in like that!
Mr. Holmes does not receive visitors without an appointment!
Oh, I'm sorry, Mr Holmes!
I can't stop him!
It's all right, Mrs Hudson!
- Would you please go downstairs? - All right
- With a door. - Of course
Xie xie
Did you get my note?
Yes, please sit down!
This is my friend and colleague Dr Watson who often helps me with my cases!
Hello to you
May I ask how to call you?
You can call me Count von Kramm and I'm a Bohemian nobleman
I'd rather talk to you alone
Two at a time, no at all
You can talk to me as much as you can before this gentleman
Well, THEN I'll take your word for it that he's a careful man to be trusted
But first I promise you and I will keep your secret for two years
Isn't it?
It won't matter in two years
It is now so important that it may influence the whole course of European history
I guarantee compliance
I am also
I don't think you like this one
The man who sent me didn't want you to know who he was sending
I confess that what I have just said is not my own true name
I know that
The situation is extremely delicate and we must take some precautions to prevent it from developing into a catastrophe
Lest one of Europe's royal families be severely damaged and frankly implicate the great House of Ormstein
The hereditary king of Bohemia. I know that too... Under the pursuit
You said it.
I am the king
Why should I hide it?
Yeah, really?
I knew before your majesty opened my mouth that I was going to
Wilhelm Gerschlich sigmund von Ormstein
Grand Duke of Cassel the hereditary king of Bohemia spoke
You're also the best duelist in Europe
We've already killed four of our opponents
A fair and just
But when
This is what the story looks like in a nutshell
Ha! Ha!
About ten years ago, during my long visit to Warsaw
Recognized a big ding ding female risk home
Irene Adler
No doubt you are familiar with the name
May I ask you to help me check her Watson on the resource guide
My suspicion, then, is that your majesty has some trouble with this lady and that you are anxious to have those letters returned which you have written to her which are incriminating
A little good
How do you know?
Italy..
Eileen Adler was born in New Jersey in 1858
Is this the right one? New Jersey. Let me see.
The singer, a alto, has retired from opera as prima Donna in Petersburg and Warsaw and is now living in London
It was her who appeared at the concert as gabin
Have you ever been secretly married to her?
Are there no torah documents or testimonies?
Didn't have
Then I shall be your majesty's secret
If this young woman intended deceit or anything else by letters how could she prove that these letters were true?
My handwriting
Bah! fake
My personal letter
steal
I copied it from my own seal
My photo
Buy the
We're both in that picture
Oh, my god. Oh, my god
Well, that's too bad
Your majesty is very careless
She's beautiful and charming and smart and brave
At that time I was only a king
Very young!
I'm not over 30 now
Did your majesty try to take back the photograph?
I've tried and failed
Your majesty must pay
She wouldn't sell it if she bought it
Then steal it
We've tried it five times
Twice I paid a pickpocket to search her house
We switched her tour once while she was traveling
And twice we pulled her over and robbed her
But none of them came back
How dare you laugh at me? !
This is a serious matter!
It is absolutely true
What was she supposed to do with it? She wasn't looking for money
Destroy me
How to destroy it?
I'm going to get married
I've heard about
I will marry Princess Corotilde Rothman von Saxes-Meningen, second daughter of the King of Scandinavia
Nice knot
Yes, you may know their strict rules
She was a very sensitive person in her own right
If there is even the slightest doubt about my conduct this marriage will fall apart
What about Irene Adler?
Threatening to send them the photos
And she would do that
Her personality is as tough as steel
She had the most beautiful face of a woman and the firmest heart of a man
I have to marry another woman who would do anything!
Your majesty why does she do this?
Oh, we talked about getting married
Ha! Ha! She didn't know it was impossible!
Are you sure she hasn't sent them out yet?
I'm sure
Why is that? Maybe the photo is on the way now
Because she had said she would send them out the day of the engagement announcement
That's the first of next Week
But I have to leave London on Friday to prepare for the ceremony
Oh, that still leaves us three days
That's lucky because I have other things on my hands
Where is your Majesty staying in London?
The name of the Wrangham Hotel is Count von Kramer
That, of course,
What about expenses?
There are three hundred pounds in gold and seven hundred pounds in notes
Irene Adler. What's miss Adler's address? Good night, your majesty
I'm sure I'll bring it to you soon
Holmes we can go to dinner at Romano but Friday is only three days away
Oh, it has to be done on Friday
Tchaikovsky himself will perform his work in the St. James Auditorium
Can't go wrong!
It must be finished on Friday
My dear Watson, I want to be alone
Are you hungry?
right
I'm sure Mrs Hudson will be happy to bring you a sandwich
Sandwich? We'll talk tomorrow afternoon
On the evening of Ann
It's a little easier than that, huh, huh?
What?
Not to see
If you wish, I can exchange it with you
What do you do?
Eight weeks as head groom
Isn't it?
You could give me a hand if you want
You look pretty old to me. Why not?
I have to pay the family for the drinks
You're trying to make some wine money
Go saddle the horse and let us see how well you're doing
The coachmen and I took a few hours off the clock
Miss Irene Adler had all the men in the neighbourhood falling at her feet
She's the prettiest thing in the world they say at Serpentine stables
She lived a quiet life and went out every day at five o 'clock and came home for dinner at seven
In addition to acting and singing, she spends her spare time in seclusion
She has only been intimate with one man
He came to see her at least once a day, often twice
This is Mr. Goffley NORTON of Inner Temple
There's a good point in making a good pass with the driver
Mr. Goffley NORTON is a lawyer and that's the point
It might not be so wonderful
Why did he keep coming to see her?
Is she his trusted friend or a lover? If she is a trustee
She had probably given him the photograph for deposit
If she were a lover the first born might not have known it at all
She began to sing
Voice empty spirit moving people Hua Sheng
Then a whole series of things happened that took me by surprise. First came a man who I thought was Goffrey. Mr. NORTON's men
Wait for me
Go and call the master of your house a carriage
Set off right now
Go to Santa Monica church on Edgewell Road
Make it five minutes before twelve at least
That's half a coin if you can do it in 20 minutes
She is truly a beauty whose beauty makes men fall for her
A face that could knock a man off his feet Never heard you say that about anyone, Holmes
I'm just being metaphorical, Watson, nothing more
I was just about to catch up with the wagon and jump into its trunk when another one came along
The driver looked and looked at my poor condition but I jumped in before he could refuse and showed him a handful of gold coins and offered him one if he could keep it for twenty minutes Get to Santa Monica Church
I don't think I've ever been in such a fast carriage
But the other two got here first
Look, I'm really, really sorry, Mr. NORTON, but I...
It's almost noon
It won't work any later
I could have found a lousy preacher but I decided I didn't have to let them know so I sent them for drinks
Oh my god!
In the gove
You're your old brother!
That's you!
A few more minutes and it's out of order!
Come on, old man, come on!
Take this and do what he says
You'll get the money
Ah, we have a witness
The ritual can be continued
We, my friends and brethren, testify before the Lord that the sacrament of marriage for this man and this woman is a very important sacrament which the Lord ordained at the beginning of his creation to signify the union of Christ and the Church Richard
I r e n a
You said I am satisfied now please allow me to say I am satisfied you
I'll see you tomorrow
Early tomorrow morning.
I love you
John
Hey, you!
Come here brother
Come over here
Goffrey let me do it
I want to thank you for your presence when we needed you
I'm lucky to have you with me all the time
On the other hand, I'm not in a hurry
I hope you can handle this one
Don't give me little Fife at all
Oh, Sir, if not, let it be a little memorial
She gave me a pound of gold
Is it
What a strange thing it was!
I'll put it on a watch chain to remember my encounter
So what do we do now?
At the time of the ritual
I think my plan has run out of steam
If this pair is immediately separated from this I have to take the fastest and most powerful measures
But on leaving the church he drove back to Temple and she went back to her place which gave me plenty of time to arrange
How do you say?
Doctor I need your courage and your dexterity
I am very happy!
Aren't you afraid of breaking the law?
Don't
Not afraid of being caught?
I'm not afraid to be the target of gao Shang
Oh, you can't go any higher than that
Then I'll be your man
Too good
The present question is...
Holmes, you are very well dressed!
The question in front of us is where we can find the photo
The land has already been stolen twice
She's too smart to steal it
She is a pretty girl
Those people must have looked for it through and through
But they don't know how to look!
How are you going to find out?
I wasn't looking for it
So what?
I'm gonna get her to show me the picture
But she's not gonna do it
She had no choice
Ah is coming
The rest of the way we are still walking to go
You know what to do
I'll do it if you put your hand up
Rendezvous at the exact spot in ten minutes
She is coming
This can not
I was here first
It was I who opened the door
No, it's not him. It's me!
Get out of my way, you two!
Let me go!
To open a door for a lady is to be the first of his disciples
You can't make us lose money
Let me pass
You leave my groom alone!
Ju-ran took the food out of my mouth!
I give you a dick and you're a dick
Oh, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no!
I'll take care of you!
Hold your hand and you have your hand
After the refund!
Look what you've done!
He is dead!
You can't wait for the police to pick you up!
He's also choking from the blows
I really don't like my husband
You've done a good job
Is he badly hurt?
It is only the skin wound to catch up with the management
We can't have him lying on the street
Let's get him into the house
Ok, Mr.
Oh, are you awake
Thank god thank God You are a brave man
Come on, Willrott
No, no, no, no. You can go
Let me take care of a friend who has come to my rescue
The father looked at me
Oh, that's gonna freak you out
My brave, dear friend
No, no, no. I won't allow it
Thank you for your
Give me a piece of gauze
Just as you said
I'm a little relieved to see you're not badly hurt
Yeah, well, the wound was pretty shallow and the shock was nothing
It's strange
What does a husband mean?
How did so many people get together so suddenly?
They are a gang of slanderers who have arranged to rob you
So many people just grab a small handbag
Oh, no, dear friend. There's not enough money for them to share. I've seen so many poor people in so many places
Even the eyes of the guilty men did not look so strange as to terrify them
Oh, I'm sorry. I feel a little dizzy
Some fresh air in the air!
Willrott open the window!
To pick up a glass of water
Do you have smelling salts?
Man, man, man I can smell a fire somewhere
What?
On fire on fire!
On fire on fire!
Was it on fire?
Come out with me, husband!
I'll take care of the old father!
I can't breathe anymore
Is fake!
It's a false alarm!
This is bad theater is... give them a holler!
Is on fire!
It's a false alarm. You hear that?
There's no need to call the fire police!
What the hell is this?
It's a plumber's smoke bomb. I have a teacher who's a plumber
He said a little bit and threw it into the pipe so you could see where the crack was
No, no, no, no, no, no
The smoke will disperse on its own
You said it was a bad play
Who would do that to me?
Gang member Mrs. Bai
But why?
I have already run away
In order to revenge
The answer?
Are there such evil people?
There are some people in this world who take the reward as their own reward
I don't think I can figure that out
I'm sure you'd like to be the same
I feel much better now
I have to go. Please stay for something to eat
Uh, I have a congregation waiting for me
Then let my cart take you?
Oh, no, no, no, fresh air will let me recover better at least tell me your name and address I thank you very much
I am no more than a humble servant in the service of the Emperor
On the evening of Ann
On the evening of Ann
Doctor, you did a good job
Did you get the photo?
Not yet but I think I know where it is
How did you find out?
She showed me what I said she would do
The question is the photo is still in her hand
Could you please lose the chance to get the photos
Didn't have
I'll call on her first thing tomorrow morning
You're going to find her?
Go in my own name and call the king again
The king? !
There is still you, Hua Sheng!
You have to be a witness
I trust you'll have a good night's sleep, Holmes
Solving a crime is the best cure for sleep loss
Rest in the evening, Mr. Locke Holmes, Watson...
And Holmes?
But she could not love him
Why do I wish she loved him?
In this way your majesty will be spared the fear that he will come out of trouble
If this matron loves her husband she does not love his
If she doesn't love your majesty why should she have to do anything important about your majesty
Mr. Sherlock Holmes, I believe?
I'm Sherlock Holmes.
My mistress has told me that you are more likely to come
She left this morning with her husband. They took the 5:15 train from Charning Cross to the continent
Has she left England yet?
There's no coming back, Sir
Now it's all over!
Take a look at again
Not this picture!
Holmes, here's another picture!
Do you hear me? !
The letter to me
It was written to me
"Dear Mr. Sherlock Holmes, you have indeed done very well."
"Got me all fooled."
"I had no doubt at all until I heard someone Shouting fire," "but then when I realized that I had revealed my secret," "I suddenly knew."
"I was advised months ago to guard you," they said, "if the king were to hire a spy."
"It's you if it is, it's you if it is."
"You still make me reveal the secrets you want to know, even when I see so many people in the street."
"Even when the alarm was issued, I still could not believe that an old shepherd, with whom HE was so dear, could care for his mother."
"But you know."
"I've always been an educated woman."
"I am no stranger to the costume of men," "It is I who follow you to your door," "Sure."
"You are the famous Mr. Sherlock Holmes," "and I took the liberty of saying good night to you."
"Then I'll go to Temple to see my husband."
"We shall be married in secret so that we may not be forced to flee from the king."
"And your appearance is our signal to depart."
"It's a scary thing to be stared at by a man like you."
"For this reason, when you call tomorrow, the building will be empty."
"Your trustee can rest easy on that picture."
"I love a man far better than he and he loves me."
"The king may..."
"The king is free to do as he pleases and not to worry about the troubles of those whom he has wronged."
"I kept that photograph for my own protection, as if it were a weapon that would come to me," "Whatever kind of hand he might take to protect me."
There are the following
"I have left another photograph which I suppose he would like to keep." "Dear Sherlock. Mr. Holmes. "" Irene NORTON Adler."
What a horny woman!
What an admirable queen she could have been!
What a pity it is not to grow old with her
What I said to this lady
She is very difficult, your whitehead and regret that I was not able to fulfill the mandate given to me
The very opposite father
I can't think of a more rounded knot
I know she means what she says
Now that photo is as safe as if it had been burned
I was very pleased to hear your majesty say so
I'm really excited about you. Please tell me what I can do in return
This ring finger?
I think your majesty has another one
You only open the mouth of something more valuable than this finger
This picture this picture of Irene?
If that's what you want
Thank you, your majesty. I wish you a pleasant morning
This is how the kingdom of Bohemia runs into a great scandal and Sherlock. Holmes's best plan ever
How can a woman's wisdom be lost? He often laughs at a woman's long hair and short sense
But I haven't heard him say that lately, and when he mentions Irene... Adler or that woman
He began to append her as "the daughter" in his eyes, and no one else could surpass her as the "dumpling" among women
This is not to say that he felt anything like love for Irene Adler -- any feeling, especially love
It was all because of his rigid, rigid head that he had a diseased eye for women
It wasn't as if they were the engine of a crime or the thread of a crime but he kept her picture hidden and locked it up
There was only one woman he could not forget in his dim memory, the beautiful Irene. Adler
This is countess Morcar's house
Thank you. Thank you. Oh, my God, she's back
She dismounted
Fast ryder
hurry
It's fixed. It should be fixed
I hate to see the plumber hanging around her house
All right, don't worry. I fixed it
Listen to you I can speed up the work faster
It's really beautiful
Beucheff's, huh?
So when you go on a date, you wear it.
Let's get out of here
Just put it on one side
It's for the three of you
The Seshefs wish you a merry Christmas
Get me a tea cusack
A good wife
I need a cup of tea to lift my spirits
The preparations before Christmas were a real grind
You're right
Then take a shower
His people
The Blue Jewel the blue jewel was stolen
Keep your eyes open
Oh, John, she's gonna love it. It's so beautiful
Just like her mother
But can we afford it?
I told you I made a little money lately
Even if there is no money, it is Christmas
That's very thoughtful of you John Horner I'm so lucky
His wife and children in the
Live like a god and buy this baby for a girl
What would you say to our son on this ship? Just let it be
Couldn't wait to fence Horner?
What do you mean? I didn't do anything. What are you thinking?
John Frederick Horner
You're guilty of stealing from the Countess of Morcar
The price under the name is worth even the city
You said I didn't steal it. I didn't steal it
Someone saw someone in your hotel
I'm not the one who stole it. Trust me
Let me go. I didn't steal it
Oh!
Mr Holmes?
Mr Holmes?
Mr. Peterson, janitor of Aberset.
Leave me alone when he needs you
Oh!
Sorry to bother you, Mr Holmes
Peterson put the goose down and your hat
I love it when you buy a fat goose for Christmas dinner
But the problem is also here, Mr Holmes
The goose is not mine
You might say I got it
"To Mrs. Henry Baker."
Obviously this isn't your hat
He is not the first
I don't know what to do about this extraordinary situation
It was a little too small a call
I told my wife about it and she suggested that I come to you
You are too wise to sit down, my dear friend
Tell me about the special situation
The good one is this one
I was on my way home last night and I just finished one
This is the time of the year when several of our doorkeepers get together.
I wish you luck on the next day
Don't wrong
Holiday wishes
You are so cruel to sensei
Here's to your health
Like I said I'm on my way home
Something unexpected has come up
Hey, are you doing it? Hey, it's the police. Run, run, run
flee
I'm trying to help you, old man
The mob ran in one direction
I tried to stop him but he clearly thought I was a security officer
Arrest him for breaking glass
So you've made off with two pieces of this old felt hat
And a fine Fat Christmas goose which I am anxious to return to Mr Holmes
But I don't know where to begin dear Peterson I see your dilemma
I don't care what I said
My wife and I decided to put these two things together
The hat and the goose are brought to you. Mr Holmes wondered whether this small matter would interest you in your particular profession
I hope I haven't wasted your time, Mr Holmes of course not
All right, doorman
Have you bought your goose yet?
Haven't?
Then I suggest you take this goose home and fulfill its destiny
And I'm just saving my old blanket hat that I never saw before I lost my Christmas dinner
Do as you say, Mr Holmes and leave it at that
It may be cold but there are signs that it's time to eat it no need to put it back
Well, THEN I'll be out of my way, Mr Holmes
I'll contact you as soon as there's a show
Good Mr.
Uh, have a nice day
And to you and yours too
You haven't found the gem yet
I don't have a husband
But we caught the thief Horner
What about the cord of the gem
We infer that
He could have helped a murderer. Why?
Man and small said the love of the festival just exactly opposite
Petty thieves don't have a reputation when they see money they throw it away Money You mean a reward?
Well, that's right
Why should I make a contribution?
In my experience it seems to have worked
I found a reward to draw out the greedy thief
Isn't it?
It would be strange if no one came for 24 hours
How much is the prize?
Holmes? Oh you are in
The Countess of Morcar has offered a reward of 1,000 pounds for information on the sapphire's whereabouts
Inspector Bradlitt in section B is in charge of the case
He's already arrested John Horner 3, 6, a plumber who vehemently protested his innocence
Further evidence confirmed that the case had been referred to the Returning tribunal
Horner fainted and was carried out of the courtroom during an emotional closing statement
I'm sorry you're busy right now
I'm disturbing you with your hat
No, it's all worthless shit
But several of its questions are not so trivial as instructive
I think this hat looks like it's connected to something sexual that's going to help you solve a crime ring
No, no, no, no, this is just one of the many things that happen in a world of marbles with four million mouths crammed into a few square miles
And what do you see in this old felt hat?
You don't know how I do things
To the people who wear these stupid felt hats
Did you get anything out of it? It was Watson with a fat goose
On the fat goose's left leg was a card that read, "To Mrs. Henry Baker."
Divide by the indentation
H.b. hypothetically means "Henry Baker." I can't see anything else
On the contrary Watson you see everything but you make no inferences about what you see
You have too little faith in your own reasoning
Tell me what you got out of this hat?
This is a man who knows a lot. You can see it in his eyes
And in the past three years, life should be rich
Though he was poor and down and out he saw far away, not as he is now, not as he used to be
And he was afraid that this might be the reason why his wife no longer loved him
My dear Holmes
But he still retains the ultimate self-respect. He lives in a simple house
He's a middle-aged man with gray hair that's been cut in the last few days and lime cream on his hair
And he must not have a kerosene lamp in his house
You must be having a laugh
Roots are not meant to be funny
I have no doubt that I am very late
Bill fang said how did you deduce that he learned to know Fubo?
This is an integration problem
There must be a lot of money in the brain bag
Which family is falling?
This kind of flat brimmed hat
Very popular three years ago, Watson this is a very good hat
Look at the silk band and the rich lining
If he had been able to afford such an expensive hat three years ago
Then he was down and he was down. What if he had a distant vision and was ruined like this?
This shows that he has a long history of selling hats without elastic straps
So he ordered it just to show that he's far-sighted
He used this method to prevent the cap from being blown away
But you see, he broke the elastic and didn't take the time to get a new one to show that he had lost his will
well
There are a few other things
He is a middle-aged man
Grey hair
I just had my hair cut recently
A dab of lime cream on his head
All of these can be broken off from the inspection of the lower part of the hat lining
The wet marks indicate that he sweats a lot and is not a man who works hard
So his wife he just said she doesn't love him anymore
This hat hasn't been brushed in weeks
For example, if I see a man whose hat has collected the dust of the zodiac, and his wife and son ignore it
I fear he has unhappily lost the love of his wife
He might be single, too
No, he wanted to give the goose to his wife as a goodwill gift
Don't forget the card attached to the goose's leg
You can always find an answer
wait
How can you deduce that he doesn't have a kerosene lamp in his house?
A drop of candle oil, or two, may occasionally be dropped
But Watson, when I saw more than five drops, knew he couldn't have got candle grease from a kerosene lamp
Are you full?
You have a good brain
The goose, Mr Holmes the goose
Why is it so hard to know it's alive again? Flapping wings out of the kitchen window?
Look at that
My wife found something in the chest
Oh, my God, Peterson, this is a hidden treasure. Do you know what it is? A diamond a jewel
Cut glass with it like putty
This is not an ordinary gem
But the precious stone
The sapphire from the world Hotel robbery
It's true
The ten thousand pounds on offer was less than one twentieth of the market price of the sapphire
Ten thousand, ten thousand pounds for god's sake
You must admit, Watson that I deduced from the hat
Its importance can be steep increase
That's Holmes the problem we're trying to solve now is sorting out everything from the stolen gems to the discovery of the goose
The sequence of events in this period
This is the gem the gem came from the goose the goose came from Mr. Henry Baker
He wore an old felt hat and had some other peculiary
What we are now trying to do is to identify the father and clarify his role in the mystery
I found a goose and a black felt hat at the corner of Goodge Street
Mr. Henry Baker please pick it up at Baker Street 221b at 6:30 p.m. Simple and clear
Yes, but will he see it? Surely he would have told the poor that it was a grievous loss
Peterson sent it to the AD agency
And to be published in all the evening papers available in which newspaper first?
The Globe, the Star, the Pall Mall, the St. James's Palace, the Echo, the News Evening, the Standard, and every other paper you can think of
I'm going to see the sensei
What about the gem?
I'll keep this gem for now
Thank you Peterson
Mr. Quick Hand and Peterson
Can you pick me up a goose on the way back?
Give him the money, Watson
I must buy Mr. Henry Baker a goose to replace the one you and your family will enjoy
Thank you very much, Sir
Ten thousand pounds?
What do you do with this gem?
I'm going to put it in my cupboard
Mr Nath
The Beatlemen are mad at me because you're locked up but she's more worried about the jewel
I've never taken a treasure stone to cure a security officer.
Tell me where you hid it
Perhaps I can help you plead with the judge
But if you don't know your face
I've been on the straight and narrow ever since I married Jerry
If you don't tell the truth
When the sheriff finds out about your ex
I'm afraid you'll never see your lovely wife again
I got you horner but I need the gem more
It's a beautiful stone. Look at all the light and color
And yet it is the root of sin and every precious stone is like this
They are the lure of evil spirits
Each cut surface on a larger and older stone represents the suffering of sin
It was found beside a river in Xiamen, south China
Its peculiarity lies in the fact that it is blue and it has the distinctive feature of a red gem
This precious stone is less than 20 years old
Tube flow is not long in the world but has a history of not comparable
Two homicides a sulphuric acid disfigurement a homicide and several robberies all attributed to this 40-grain crystallized carbon
Who would have thought that such a beautiful ornament could be a supplicant to the hanging-rack and prison?
Into the to
Are you Mr. Henry Baker?
Please sit near the wall stove
It is so cold today that I think your circulation is better in summer than in winter
Sit down quickly
This is my good friend and partner, Dr. Watson
Hello Mr.
Mr Baker
Is this your hat?
Yes, it's my hat
Thank you, Sir
I'm trying to find something but I'm not as shy as I used to be
I took away the hat and the goose for the vagabonds that attacked me
I don't think we have to pay more for something we can't get back
Of course I can figure that out
By the way, we've already eaten your goose
ate
If the fruit does not do that goose is really not worthy of food
But we bought another goose and it was on the sideboard
I think it should be just as heavy as your goose and just as fresh
Oh, of course
Still we kept the original goose's woolly legs waiting, if you wish
I don't see any use for my goose's zero-star shred except that
If you don't mind
I... I think my concern is me -- I'm going to focus my attention on that fat goose I saw in your pantry
Where did you get that goose
I am very interested in domestic poultry and I have seldom seen such good fat geese
So I'm very interested in the goose's knobs you bought
It was the club that gave birth to my first goose club
Goose club? Be a little more specific
I... I'm not a rich man as you can see
I live a humble but dignified life and let's just say I work at the British Museum
Do research?
I guess so and help other people with their research
I read a lot of books
I left the museum in the morning and at noon that day
I went to see some of my colleagues at the Alpha Inn Museum
I often go to that shop this year
Mr. Wendgate started a goose club and in consideration of paying a few pence a week to the club we all got a goose for Christmas
A nice fat goose for your Mr. Baker
It's a hard to see fat goose
Now you can patch things up with your wife and son, right?
I'm afraid she's a little bit of a fan
I'm sure things will turn out well for me when I find something that pays again
Oh, it must be a technical job
I'm good at it
This is the 8 benzodiacs I owe you last time
"Quick money," Mr. Baker? I bumped into one of them
It is true that a familiar person with a sympathetic heart is rich
I sold him some of my books
It's not your book, Mr. Baker
It had to be that This winter Mr. Wendgate was more miserable than ever
We should not give up the things we love and the people we marry
Let's put this gesture aside while I relax the pressure
So I'll have a large whiskey and a pint of your best beer
Merry Christmas.
Merry Christmas, Mr. Baker
On my way home
I was attacked by a mob for stealing my geese
I lost my cap in the twisting, too
All I can remember is a police officer in a uniform showing up and we all ran away
That's something we can figure out
Under the circumstances
It is good that bears good
Thank you very much for your trouble, Mr. Smith
I think this scotch hat
It's not fit for my age or my body
Happy festival, Mr. Sheng
So are you, Sir
Thank you for your
By the way, do you have a kerosene lamp?
Kerosene lamps certainly don't have very good Christmas cheer
Merry Christmas to you both, too
Well, this is the end of Mr. Henry Baker
He obviously doesn't know anything about the gems, Mrs. Hudson
Watson, are you hungry?
Not very hungry
Too good
Mrs. Hudson can turn our dinner into a midnight snack
We're gonna touch the vine while it's hot
Could it be hotter than a midnight snack?
Good evening, gentlemen. It's really cold tonight
It's true, Mr. Board
What would you like to drink?
Beer huasheng? What? Oh good
Two of your best beers, please
Wait a moment, Mr.
If your beer is as good as your goose it is the purest beer
My goose?
We just spoke to Mr. Henry Baker, a member of your Goose club, half an hour ago
Oh, well, those geese aren't ours
Whose is that?
I bought two or four from a vendor in Covent Park
What's his name?
Breckinridge was a supplier who always had a good supply
Remind yourself if you want to buy a goose
I can ride up to him and you know this is the busiest time of the year
Thank you for your advice
Can I get you another beer?
God bless you, Sir
Go find Breckinridge right now
Do you have to go now?
Watson we're following up on a lead that the police have overlooked that just happened to fall into our hands
We have to follow the line to the bottom of it and we're heading south at a fast pace
Don't cry
I want to believe you too John really
But I can't argue with what the policeman said
But they only said they took me because I was there
I'm just doing odd jobs
Is it really like this?
I promised you when WE were married
I will never lie to you
I have always kept my promise
I want to believe you, too
Good evening
Good evening
I see your geese are all sold out
You got five hundred to sell in the morning
It's too late. There's more at the stall with the kerosene lamp on
But my family brought me to you
Who?
The owner of the Alpha Inn
Yeah, he bought two or four from me
Those geese were right
Can I tell you where you got it?
Okay, Mr.
What are you thinking about?
There are to the point
I have made myself very clear
I just want to know who supplied those geese you sold to Alpha
I don't want to tell you this is it
It's a small thing but I don't know why you're so angry
Big liver fire try to get caught up in this
I pay through the nose for good stuff and that's the end of it, right?
What? "Where's the goose?" "Who did you sell it to?" "How much did you sell it for?"
It's like you know there's no other goose in the world
I assure you I have nothing to do with the rest of your inquiries
Ask to check? This is a simple question
I'm not gonna Sue you
Well, that bet's gonna blow
What's the bet? What's the bet?
For ever will I hold fast my way of thinking about domestic birds
I bet my friend here five pounds that the goose I chose was raised on a farm, right?
What? Yeah, yeah, yeah, that's what happened
Then you lost because he was raised in the city
It's not like that
That's what I don't believe
Bring me the money, Holmes
You think I don't understand because I've known domestic birds since I was a kid
I'm telling you the geese sold to Alpha are all raised in the city
You can't convince me
Please holmes is willing to take the gamble
Are you willing to bet?
That will only make you lose money
And yet I would bet you a sovereign to teach you to believe in yourself
Clinch a deal that good
Take a closer look at Mr. Hubris and here's my account book with a list of people who sold me geese
This page is full of countrymen
This page in red ink is all about suppliers in the city
Read me the name of the third person
Mrs Oakeshott 11 17 Brixton Road
Guest code 2, 4, 9
Good. Take another look at the ledger
Mrs. Oakeshott's egg and poultry supplier?
What was the last entry?
24 geese sold to Wendgate, Alpha Inn, for seven shillings and six pence
Do you have anything else to say?
What about the first five pounds?
Well done, Holmes
To see Mrs. Oakeshott tonight?
It's not you again. It's not you
I told you they're all sold out
Listen to me there are two grey-crested geese
Look, I'm sick and tired of you and your geese and you can go fuck yourself
If you bother me with any more of this nonsense
I'll set the dogs on you
Listen, Mrs. Oakeshott told me...
You bring Mrs. Oakeshott here and I'll give her an answer
But what's that got to do with you?
Did I get my goose from you?
No, but there's a goose in there that's mine
Then you go to Mrs. Oakeshott and ask her to send me to you
You can ask the King of Prussia for it's none of my business
I've had enough
Get the hell out of here
It'll save us a trip to Brixton
I'm sorry I couldn't help overhearing your conversation with that dealer
I think I can help you with that, too
Really? Who are you?
I'm Sherlock Holmes and it's my job to know things that no one else knows
But you can't know that
I know the opposite
I understand you're trying to locate a batch of geese that Mrs. Oakeshott of Brixton Road sold to Breckinridge
Breckinridge sold the goose to Mr. Wendgate of the Alpha Inn
You are the one I am looking for
I cannot express how much I am interested in the matter
Then I suggest we discuss this in a more comfortable place
The horse car
Come in!
I'm going to change into my slippers
I guess we need to know who we're working for, right, Watson?
John Robinson
No, no, no, I asked for your real name
It's not always easy to use a name for business
Well, then my real name is Ryder James Ryder
Yes, Mr. Ryder the foreman of the World Hotel
right
You should be interested to know that the goose in particular is the one with the white body and the gray crown?
Oh, Sir, can you tell me where it is?
It came to me and you? Unfortunately, it is no longer here
But the goose died and laid an egg
The prettiest, shiniest little blue egg I've ever seen
Here, let me show you
The game is over ryder
Stand firm when your heart falls into the furnace
He's too thin a poor bastard to be brave enough to commit a serious crime
I've got everything I need to know about this case and there's nothing you can tell me
Catherine Cusack put me up to it
She was a servant of the Bechefes
Yeah you heard through the grapevine that Horner was involved in a similar burglary
And then what did you do you and your partner Cusack did something in the Countess's room
Try and get Horner in there
And you stole the gems and called the cops and the unfortunate Horner went to jail
For god's sake, have pity on me
Think about my dad and my mom and they're gonna be heartbroken
I've never done anything bad before and I'll never do it again
I will swear with my hand upon the holy scripture
Don't send me to court, Mr Holmes
Don't do that for god's sake
Sit back in your chair
Now he's on his knees begging for mercy why don't you have a little pity for Horner who's in the dock because of you without even knowing it?
I will be far away, Mr Holmes
I will leave this country
Then the accusation against him will be dropped
We'll talk about that later
Now tell me how the jewel got into the goose's belly
And how did the goose end up in the market?
Tell me that this is your only hope for survival
I will tell you everything that has happened
I thought it best to take the jewel and get away because I never knew when the police would want to search me and my room
There is not a safe place in the hotel
I walked out of the hotel pretending to be on an errand and then went to my sister's house to settle the score again
What's the matter, Jem? You look terrible
I'm a little shaken up there's been a burglary at the Maggie's hotel
You are quick to into the house
I went into her backyard where she raised geese and smoked and wondered what to do
I remember being in a panic before DECIDING where to hide the head for the time being
Suddenly I saw geese squawking in the corner of the courtyard
My sister once told me that I could have a goose for Christmas
I picked out a goose with a grey crown a nice fat goose
I thrust the jewel into its throat and into its throat as far as my fingers can reach
I have put to rest all my troubles and pains at this time.
What are you doing with that goose, Jem? You said I could pick one for Christmas
I'm trying to figure out which one is the fattest
We saved yours. We called it "Jem's goose."
Well, Maggie, it's all the same to you
I want the one I just had on my hand
But the one I left for you weighs three pounds
We've been fattened up for a long time
I'll take that one. I'll take it right away
Whatever you
Which one do you want?
The one with the gray crown in the middle okay
Just kill it and take it with you
I did as she asked, Mr Holmes
I took the goose to my friend's house and we used knives
Opening the goose chilled my heart
There was no sapphire in the chest I knew something was afoot
Where are all the geese?
Sold it to a dealer
Which merchant?
Breckinridge in Covent Park
Tell me, is there another goose with a grey cap?
Yeah, there were two of them
Even I can't tell them apart
What's the matter? Why are you panicking?
I ran as fast as I could to Breckinridge
But he's already sold all the geese and won't tell me who I sold them to
It's driving me crazy
Now I've been branded "petty thief" even though I didn't get the treasure THAT I sold my identity for
Please forgive me
Please forgive me
Get out of here
What?
May god bless you, Sir
Give me to shut up
Roll!
I must admit Holmes this is a bit of a surprise
I haven't been invited to the police station to tell them what they don't know
I may have committed a terrible crime but I may have saved someone
If we put him in prison he'll be a prisoner all his life
Then it came at the very moment of forgiveness
In the middle of the
Merry Christmas, Holmes
Merry Christmas to my dear friends, etc
I can't eat when I think about Holmes and John Horner being locked up
Do you think That Brazztree or his associates might still be working the case?
You're right, Watson. Let's go
Here's your tea, Mrs Buckley
Your tea is too much
I hate you. I hate you
I hate you. I hate you
Big who
- Your tea is too
- David, you betrayed him
Mr Ning Mrs.
What's wrong with you, kid
The door won't open
I'll try
You two have to stop him
Mrs. Barkley opened the door
Mrs. Barkley opened the door
The door was locked from the inside and there was no key
I'll call the medic and police
There were many of them when I sailed home with my injuries
Very well done in counterinsurgency in India
You're not gonna regret taking this case
Ah the sentry
Dr Watson is a former army doctor with the Royal Berkshire Regiment who now practices his own medicine
I'm Lieutenant Colonel Murphy and I'm now in temporary charge of the Royal Marros regiment following the tragic death of the colonel
This must be Mr. Holmes
Please have a seat
I'm glad you got here so soon
You're welcome
I've explained to Mr. Holmes how worried you must be about the potential scandal
Xie xie
The honor of the regiment now rests upon me
But the papers say there's gotta be something in there
Certainly no
I have driven the writers as far away as I can
They are all the more suspicious
They must have sniffed out the mystery, even if they knew very little
Oh, but it can't be renewed. Bring back their energy.
Is the
You can see how much we need your help, Mr Holmes
What do you say? Sherlock Holmes
What can I say
Colonel Murphy you didn't tell me anything!
I came to Aldersolt on the strength of Watson's efforts to convince him that he was far more interested in military affairs than I was
You should have told me the truth when I came!
The commanding officer of this regiment
Colonel James Buckley was found dead in his apartments around 10:00 last night
The body was found in the early morning sitting room by Private Colonel Bates' messenger
There was a two-inch-long wound in the back of the head that clearly had been caused by blunt force trauma
On the floor next to the body was a peculiar hand-carved wooden stick
And lying on the couch in a coma, Nancy Barkley is Mrs. Barkley
Go back to Colonel Murphy, please
The servants only noticed the tragedy when they heard the quarrel between Colonel Buckley and his wife
The servants tried to enter the morning room but found the door locked
Bates went round to the garden and entered through the French window
Is it Mrs. Buckley you're looking at now
Yeah, but she's definitely not the kind of person to do that
I was lieutenant to the late Colonel Buckley in his regiment for many years
So I know Mrs. Buckley very well
But when
Tell me more about Colonel Buckley is he held in high regard by his men
Considering his back, he is highly esteemed
His back view? Can't you tell what kind of stain he has
No, but nobody on the outside knows that James... Buckley had been a private in maros's regiment
Is it?
It is a rare accomplishment to rise from a second class soldier to a commanding officer in the same regiment
He got his promotion because of his bravery in the Indian insurgency and he's been rising faster than I have over the years
Of really let a person imprint elephant deep engrave
Is the unfortunate Mrs. Buckley in custody?
No, all of it
She's in the hospital with people watching her and a police officer in there
Nancy Barkley is a very respectable woman now but you should have seen her as a young woman in India thirty years ago
She is the daughter of a soldier regiment
Her father was a master Sergeant of the Regiment warrant Officer Devoy and so a formidable father-in-law to any soldier
I remember that all my companions thought her the prettiest girl in the land
As a junior military officer, I never knew her well, but I did notice that she was as charming and energetic as a great aunt
So of course Buckley wasn't the only one in the regiment
The man who courted her but he was her final choice
They were married at Balti, not far from Camber, in the summer of 1858, a few months after General Neale's troops had freed our regiment from the encirclement
Soon after her marriage
Sergeant Buckley was promoted just as you'd expect
Marriage may have had a rough start for the Buckleys
A low-born sergeant married the daughter of a regimental sergeant major
Yeah, there should be some social rubbing
But Nancy charmed them off and they were quickly accepted
Buckley's career was on the rise five years ago when the regiment returned from India
Buckley was promoted to corps commander
Have they been very lucky in their marriage?
It looks like it is
Look?
Most people regard the marriage as very happy
What do you think of Colonel Murphy
I got to visit the Buckleys a lot because I was number two
I saw the other side of their marriage
More important than your loyalty to the deceased
I had dinner at the Buckleys' one night
It was at the end of the driveway that I remembered I'd left my cigaratelle box in the dining room
I walked back and the front door was still open
Jane's a maid and she's in the lobby
I'm so glad you're still here
I left my ketchup box on the table
I think Colonel Buckley and His wife are both in bed, Sir
James, for god's sake
Tell the truth. Who is it? Who is it?
Let me go. You're hurting me
Then tell me you love me and no one else
Do you hear me? Do you hear me?
Would I marry you if I didn't love you
I don't know when I really want to know
This jealous brawl took place shortly after your departure, Colonel Murphy
So tell me about This Guy, Buckley is he a violent person or not?
Sometimes yes
He has nothing to show for his younger children
But if you have to climb all the way up, you must have some patience to do it
Surely he would not feel unwell enough to point the finger?
There will be times when he will suddenly become very dark
To the queen
To the queen
Sometimes we would talk about some old battle primir or the insurgency or the war in Afghanistan and suddenly the smile would disappear from his lips as if it had been snatched from him by an invisible hand Like the
Yes, having served in India for so long does have some impact
I see it in Berkshire too
Did you mention a hand-carved wooden stick next to the body that the colonel brought back from India as a souvenir
The servants said they had never seen the stick before
I haven't seen one in my many visits
It's a long one
Did the police take it in for inspection?
Is the
They felt it was a weapon
Is it
I think we should start by visiting the Colonel's residence but it would be nice if we could see Mrs. Buckley first
I'm afraid she's still in the dark
I think so, too
David... David...
What a beautiful morning
Holmes could Mrs. Buckley have had a lover and Colonel Buckley knew about it?
Colonel Murphy seems pretty close to her
You are aware that this kind of warmth is very common between officers and women in hot service
Thank you, Watson, for enlightening me on military morality
If Murphy and Mrs. Buckley were really having an affair would he have brought up that little episode about forgetting the cigar box?
It was probably half past seven when I was waiting for dinner
One night a month Mrs Buckley goes to Aldersolt to do charity work
You're in such a hurry about where you're going
I answered at eight o 'clock, Ann. Morrison
I'll be at the grand hall in time
Those jumpers jumping up and down in your old clothes are what make you sick
Well, that's up to you
I think we should give back what we've got
We've been lucky enough that other people don't
Don't come back too late
I won't
Mrs. Buckley was supposed to be back at 9:15, Sir
I was in the kitchen helping the cook with the dishes
There was a distant thunder
I was just saying to Mrs Fenning, "Looks like a storm is coming," when the bell rang in the living room in the morning
I arrived to find Mrs. Barkley back
She paced up and down the room, sitting still and pale
She looks like a mess, Sir
Did you ring the bell too
Yes, I'd like some tea, please
A good wife
Jane is that you
Yes, Sir. I feel like I've heard too much
Yes, she was in her room in the morning
Waking up in the morning? Yes, Mr.
I was just about to bring a pot of tea to Mrs
Tea? What kind of tea are you waiting for at this hour
So that was the last time Mr. Buckley was seen alive?
Yes, Mr.
Do you suppose you know why your mistress will go to her morning quarters? It was so late that there was no fire
I don't know the Tao Sensei
Did she avoid going to school by accident?
Did you hear them arguing before
No precursors as far as I know
When you came back from the kitchen with the tea you found the door locked and heard them raise it
Tell me exactly what you heard
They were arguing with each other
She said she was a coward at school
She said you had ruined my life for years
The wife called out the name David
Said the two
The big who? Do you swear to that?
Thousands of true million is born
But the colonel's name is James
Have you ever heard of a woman named D, A, V, I, D before?
No colonel and no missus know anyone named David
Colonel Murphy's Christian name was Patrick
Have they had a guest named David lately?
There was no first born
Colonel Buckley's body was found with a wooden stick have you ever seen it before?
There is no colonel
There were some trophies from India but not the stick
Are you sure, Miss Stoall?
Yes, Mr.
I don't know where that came from
Thank you. That's all for today
Oh, no, there's the last thing
Colonel Murphy once left a cigar box behind did you find it
Yes, Mr.
Go to school and lie down here, Sensei
Head by the grate?
Yes, Mr.
You can also see blood stains
But the worst thing was his face
His face?
I turned him over
I almost fainted when I saw his face
A twisted and sinister look filled with fear
It's like seeing the God of death?
It may well be a precursor of
Thank you Bates
What kind of ghosts can scare school like that?
It's definitely not Nancy Barkley
The door was locked and the key was gone
Gone?
At last we had to call a locksmith to open the door
Have you searched for the key?
I looked all over the place
Mrs. Buckley didn't take it and it's not in Colonel Buckley's pocket
Thank you, Mrs Fenning
Watson if the key wasn't in the door and the Buckleys didn't take it then...
Then there should be a third person
That's right. That person wants to go in through this window and out through it
These are the footprints of Bates
But these belong to someone else
He had been walking through the grass only a short time ago and the trail was clearly visible
He came in and out the window Watson we're on the right track
Watson, look at this.
- What is this? - The stranger had an unusual companion
Is the dog? Whose dog is it?
Does anyone hear a dog gnaw at the window curtain
Is it just a cat?
These paw prints are not those of a cat or a monkey or any other creature we are familiar with
15 inches less from rear to front PAWS
Add in the length of the neck and the pouch of the brain and this animal can be as little as two feet long and even longer with a tail
It also has an odd stride length which indicates that this animal has a long body and short legs
Like a stoat or weasel?
We also know it's a carnivore
How do you know?
Paw prints show him biting through the curtain
Want to eat goldfinch
Don't wrong
And what was this beast when he was born
I can't be a traitor. Friends, don't push me
Miss Morrison had been happy and content when Mrs. Barkley left home the night before
But two hours later she came home a different person
The police now suspect that she's the killer
It's your job to clear her name
You must tell me what happened that night that made her so great
Well if I can help her I'll break my promise to keep it secret
This is what happened...
Unusual
Here we often see shapes and colors of people
But the night before I had seen the strangest man I had ever seen
His knees bent as he walked with a crooked back and a lame leg
His black face wrinkled like a shriveled apple
I secretly think that there really are some people in the world who suffer far more than they should
The man was dressed in eastern garb which made him look even more awkward
I pointed him out to Nancy and thought he deserved our special attention
Nancy was really in a good mood that night and I saw her go up to the guy and ask him if he needed help
And that's when she changed
She talked to the man and then suddenly turned pale
She looked as if she had seen a ghost
The man could not see her. I could see him gesticulating furiously
Then Nancy and the man went into a quiet corner and they talked for a while and I heard the man let out an angry scream and then he ran out shaking his fist What happened to Nancy
Are you all right?
Who is that pitiful family friend?
It's an old friend of mine in bad shape
Promise me Annie you won't say anything about this to anyone, okay
If you want me to keep it secret, I will answer it
Who is that man's?
I knew you were gonna ask me that
Nancy left after the encounter
I naturally asked the regular guests about this man
This unusual man was bound to attract some attention
It seems that he was a soldier returning from India and no one knows anything else about his history except that he earned his living by entertaining troops and performing magic tricks
Did you tell the police about this man?
No promise is a promise
Yes, of course
Thank you, Miss Morrison.
That's our intruder's four-legged companion
A mongoose
I think we've found the man we're looking for
Mr. Henry Wood has just arrived from India
May I have a word with you
What does it matter
The death of Colonel Buckley
She deserves nothing, I swear to you
Then you're the one who's guilty
No, I deserve nothing, too
Then who took down Colonel Buckley?
It was providence that killed him and his sinful heart
You'd better explain that
On the emperor if I really beat his brain bag its fact I always think this kind of do come that is also he deserves
No, I never laid a finger on his head
Someone saved me the jitters
Let me tell you my story
I have nothing to be ashamed of
Before you shall be a man whose back is like a hump, and whose ribs are all askew
But I, Corporal Henry Wood, was the handsomest man in the Royal Maross regiment
Were you in the same regiment as Colonel Buckley?
No, he was only a second class back then
We belonged to the same army and had one thing in common: we both fell in love with the same woman: Nancy. Germany walter,
She is the daughter of the regimental sergeant major
Two people love her and she only loves one
She... you're gonna laugh when you see me curled up in front of the fire and hear me say that Nancy loves me for how handsome I am
I'm the one she's always loved
But though I have won her heart her father would not approve
I'm a reckless little boy but I'm honest
Nancy's father asked her to marry Buckley
He's careful to stay out of trouble and do nothing wrong unlike me who took Nancy to places her father didn't like
And Buckley was educated. He had a bright future.
Naturally, Warrant Officer Devoy felt Buckley was a better fit for his daughter
But she was loyal to me and we would have been married if it hadn't been for treason
So why didn't Nancy marry the man she loved
It was the rainy season of 1857 when the Sepoys suddenly mutinied
The regiment was besieged at Porte
There are 10,000 rebels around us like dogs around an old rat cage
We are short of ammunition and food and have only managed to contact General Neal's advancing forces
So that we can be saved
Our commanders are beginning to select a volunteer who must be strong enough to slip out of his camp at night and make contact with the troops on the ground
Stupidly, I volunteered
It was a dangerous operation with 1,000 brothers in danger
But when I was there was only one person in my mind
Nancy Devoy my love the most beautiful girl with the breath of life between her lips
Saying goodbye to her is the hardest thing in the world
I had no idea when we exchanged our letters
This is thirty years
That night my rival in love saw me heading out through the enemy line Sergeant Buckley
He says no one knows the landscape better than he does
I would like to deliver the letter
He volunteered to help me figure out the best route to take
After listening to him finish, he was under the protection of the fire power of his friends
I set out
Buckley told me to follow a stream and then come to a ravine
He said it was the best way down the mountain
His guidance was perfect and soon I was wading through icy streams of snow from the Previous day in the Himalayas
I could see no more lamps and fires in the rebel camp than I went down to the valley, past their sentry posts
He made himself safe
All of a sudden I was hit
Something hit me hard on the head and I felt the sky spinning
When I woke up, I found myself hanging from a tree like a chicken, tied tightly together
He felt the pain as if he were twisted into a hemp flower
I don't care what's so hard for me is that I failed at my job
What's going to happen to those people I'm going to save
But the biggest blow was yet to come and I realized I'd been sold out when I heard one of the rebels talking
And the guy who sold me out was the guy who showed me the way Barkley sold me out so he could have the girl I loved
Now do you know what James Barkley is good at
To our surprise, General Neal's troops are already on their way to rescue Balti
The rebels withdrew and took me with them and I was tortured
I tried to escape from being abused
I haven't seen a white person in all those years
My captors fled north into the mountains and held me as a slave
Not even a dog like me they've broken every bone in my head
There were moments when I wished they had killed me but it was my hatred of the man who had ruined my life that fueled my desire for life
I dreamed of getting revenge on Buckley
One day an Afghan tribe killed the rebels who were holding me
I was left there to die and I survived like a miracle
I want revenge for my suffering and I don't have Buckley
And Nancy I don't even know if she's alive or dead
I wandered back to Punjab where I lived with the locals and studied as a street magician
Learned to live by magic
What was the point of sailing back to England with my old companions when I was a poor cripple?
Even the thought of revenge could not bring me back
Let me get this straight
I'd rather Nancy and the boys at Maros thought Henry was... Wood died like a hero standing on his back so they wouldn't see me crawl back out in the world like a chimp
But you came back to Aldersolt to your old regiment post
Why is that? I just want to see my country one more time before I die
I saved every penny to buy a ticket home
I didn't know the regiment was stationed at Aldersolt
I only want to go where there's an army
I earned three meals a day by playing magic at a diner
I've given up the idea of killing Buckley and the flames of revenge have been dying for years until I met her
I think I still have to wear English clothes
Wearing this foreign dress all the time makes me look very funny
At first, I just wanted to find a thick coat, so I didn't have to look at the ladies who were distributing clothes
Then one of them came by
I recognized her on the horse
She hasn't changed a bit and she's still pretty
What's even more amazing is that she...
She looks like she still recognizes me
You want me to help you
Did you find any of your...
I don't think so.
Nancy, it's me. I'm Henry
Don't be afraid
I've been counting on you for 30 years
I am dead.
I never thought I'd see you again
We talked for a while
I told her about me
I should not have told her that her husband was a traitor, but I burst out with a vengeance that had held me back for thirty years
She was shocked at what I said
I can't bear to watch it
When I left, I saw her rushing out and FOLLOWED her to her house
I saw her enter the room and the light came on
I could see her sitting in a chair
Then he came in
James, I need to talk to you
-Lock the door for fuck's sake
- I told you not to be late, didn't I?
Are you in a relationship with someone
- No.
- You must be with someone!
Didn't have
Who is it?
You ruined my life
It's been so many years
How can you do this
- You evil devil
- Here's your tea, Mrs Buckley
I hate you hate you hate you hate you hate you
Don't
I saw him grab her body and I was so mad
I can't control my feelings
David, your tea wife
David you betrayed him
Is not the
He's alive. I told you I saw him
You are lying
Are you crazy
I've never seen anyone look at me the way he does
I saw death in his face
My life was like a bullet through his heart of guilt
Mrs. Barkley Mrs. Barkley open the door
He fell against the fence
She died before she fell
Mrs. Barkley Mrs. Barkley open the door
I took the key from Nancy's hand to open the door and call for help
But I think I'd better get going or things will be very unpleasant for me
I threw the keys in my pocket and went after Teddy who escaped from his cage and bit the curtain
Ty di
So the school died before he fell and hit the fence?
It must have been the wind of fright
Mr. Wood if the coroner finds the same Mrs. Buckley
Nancy will go free
I don't suppose you'd go back to the police and tell them what you just told them if you had anything to do with it?
Mr Holmes, how is Nancy
She's in the hospital
It won't be long before you're all over again
Thank god
How are you? It's so good to see you
Are you feeling better?
Yes, much better
Holmes there's something I don't quite understand
The colonel's James and Wood's Henry or Harry so who's David anyway
My good Watson, if I had been careful, I would have discovered that the name David would have told the whole story. Haven't you always thought I was good
But this time my reasoning powers failed
The name David in this case is actually a word of reproach
Responsibility for?
Do you remember King David of Israel? He fell in love with Bathsheba, the wife of General Uriah and sent her to the front to die so that he could claim bathsheba for himself
This story can be found in book I or II of Samuel
I'm afraid I've forgotten all about the Old date
You were right, Holmes
Samuel, book 2, chapter 11, 1-4, 17
Well, obviously you've done your homework since you came back from Aldersolt
How do you know that?
You used the bill from our dinner at Waterloo as a bookmark in the book, didn't you?
Severe Watson
Just getting started, dear Holmes
Good evening to an old friend
I must ask you to close the play now
Ok, thanks
Do you have any idea what this looks like?
It's like roller Coaster
You know what I mean?
Try to do it with me
How high is the London Eye?
How tall is Big Ben?
Since then, I have been working as a technical specialist for about two years
Very good
Cool.. can't get up
Does it look like a telephoto? And...
No, only on the net.
I shoot some films, but I mainly write about science and technology
Cool, great tech..
Where did you end up?
Travel like Indiana Jones?
Four parts of the mountain wading water, take risks to make difficult
In fact, my journey is not far off
But I first flew to Sydney and then Thailand
- really jealous
- India, yes
I went to Rome...
- I spent the whole vacation in Europe. - Even I didn't go that far
Is it true?
Very good
Then I went to Pamplona, Spain
- Isn't there a bull fight?
- Run with the cows
- You run with the cows?
- no wrong -
- That's how I got this wound
- not simple
You really are Indiana Jones
Do you have a leather whip in your bag? Is there a hat?
I saved the world from poison
That's kind of cool
I'm just... trying to do something I've never done before
Is that what this trip is all about? From me?
Yeah, well, in a way,
I....
It is my goal to leave home
Yeah, it's just... whatever, it's fine
I'm afraid there aren't many exciting places in England
It's the last stop on the tour
Unfortunately, I'm going home next week
- Not much time...
- the next week?
-yeah, we don't have much time
Give me something fun to do
- Something fun?
- to
The old days
You are good
Good morning..
Another scar
Is it
I guess you got hurt shark fishing in Cape Town, man
- Is that the best you can do with your American accent? - is the
The work of Josh Peters, the bad boy in high school
He and I were fighting in art class
He hit me with something like an iron bar
Is a bastard
"What a jerk."
- very don't like
- Sorry, is it yours or mine?
It must be yours
- "Mom," typical American
- is the
Aren't you going to answer it?
It's a little hard on you
You want to talk to her now?
You want to talk to my mom
- I can call her. - Okay
I don't think so
Are you hungry?
Look at these games
You're a gamer. That's right
I should be a working man
Have you ever been beaten by a girl in A whirling wind?
Is this... your date book?
What? "Different point"?
How can electroencephalography be more intelligent than men just as women were many years ago
What I do is like a joke
- You know what?
- is it?
- to
- Is that what you said?
Yeah, you got some of that in here
-Do you have some of that in here?
-yeah, there was
That's a funny joke.
Please enjoy your marmite
Oh my god
Do you really eat this stuff?
good
Okay, mom, mom saved me
The best way to stop her calling is...
I don't know. Answer it
I don't want to worry about all this right now
She is very worried about
You're her son
You've been traveling all this time, I just thought if you talked to her...
I'm still living with her in Syracuse
That's good. No question
I'm taking care of my dad
The dead
He...
No, he's dead
- day!
- Year, no, it doesn't matter
There was a drag
Early onset Alzheimer's disease
It must be very difficult
Yeah, he's my best friend
He looked at me sometimes, not knowing who I was
My mother... I never...
I don't know how to talk to her
I don't feel that way
I don't even know how to say it
This is why I went away
That's why I took this trip
In order to leave, while I can do my best to make memories
I knew I had to talk to her.
But not on a cell phone. I just... I'll take care of it
I'll deal with it when I get back. It's just...
You're a good man, Cooper
Call your mother
0, 0, 1, 9, 3, 9, 2, 9
No, I didn't buy sandals in Koh Samui last night because I was in...
How long will that take?
Because I want to buy a plane ticket back to America
My day,
Can I say this is the most shameless second encounter ever?
great
Oh, my God. Thank you.
Alright
-Don't forget your line of work
-All right, yeah
You're awesome I don't know what that means but I've heard people say you're awesome
I have a plan
Odd jobs
- For whom?
- It's a procedure
You can use... when I'm short of money
- Yes. - Some of them are interesting
"Looking for people who love you."
- Looks right up your alley. - Okay
Okay, four pounds. That's a lot of money. That's right
(Saito game) a little out of the way
Some kind of playtest, a company called Zitu..
Saito game... Yeah
Big companies
- It's really big. - Really?
entangled
Have you ever heard of...
What is that...
"Harlek's Ghost"?
Yes, I have
I used to hang out with my best friend David Lavey in his basement when we were in seventh grade
That's Saito
That's his company
- He's a genius. He's creative
-Well, apparently they're working on a new project
Put a large amount of capital into gold, empty before creating new
But keep it so tight that it doesn't leak
Maybe if I play my cards right I can give you exclusive access to Xiangyu
A family visit?
You should take a picture
Seriously, if you get any of the pictures they're planning you'll make a hell of a lot more than four pounds
That's a good idea
Where is the company located?
Mr. Cooper?
Just call me Cooper
I'm sorry, Mr. Cooper
Just call me Cooper
In that case, just call me Kitty
You're good.
-Follow me, please. -Okay
- I'll put my backpack in here
- Ralph will take care of it
Ralph will take care of it.
Very good
I don't want to carry it in
This reminds me of the demon King in the last level
You know, rising dragon boxing
- Along the way?
- Very nice, thank you
- Is the car ready to pick you up?
- full of meaning
This way, please
They are looking at...
Cool..
Quick point
I think I'm going to see Dumbledore
I hope I get assigned to Gryffindor House
Please take out your mobile phone and a device that can be used to transmit and receive messages
- Don't you feel a little spiritual?
- You can't be too careful
Ok, take it
You are a real soul
The white
Okay, SO I guess I'm a kidney donor?
This is a standard confidentiality agreement
You know that the small hand skills involved are very important
I'm sorry. Do you need it?
We, who are not permanent, will not steal your kidneys
I'm sure
It's like getting your ears pierced
"Machine secret capital material big brain under the load of the game, between the continuation of the end.."
What about the signature page?
Where do I sign my name?
Sign the name
There's a page missing. Hold on a second
Okay, I'll be right here... waiting
What the hell?
(What is the medical procedure?)
- All right?
- is very good
What we are working on is an augmented reality system
- Is an image a virtual reality?
- It's more real than real
- What is that?
- We call them "mushrooms."
- Like in super Mario Bros?
- You can say that if you want
- You have the talent for such things, don't you?
- I've never killed anyone before
Is that all right?
good
To complete the
- That's it?
-Look, tell me I'm a one-liner
Don't worry. It's not permanent
good
Is this some kind of memory test?
- You'll see
- Well, you may feel a slight tingling when you start
good
It starts at 5:38
- Are you ready?
- Yes, Sir
Fast ok
I turned off the phone for my sake
complete
How are you feeling?
I feel great
- Keep your eye on the target. - Okay
What do you see?
It's like...
It's like a gopher in a video game
- Are there more sections now?
-Right, right, right
- Where are you now?
- the death
To die, it is in..
May I touch it?
It's not real,
It's some kind of psychological reflection
- You can see it
I can't see
- Can't you see?
Is....
All right
Hitting it
Hit it with force? good
All right, it's like whack-a-Mole
I've played it a million times. Okay
good
began
Come on
Where are you coming from?
Where did you go?
Okay, don't come up
good
It's so fun... you're so cute
-All right, see you later
Didn't it?
-Fear is like this
Ground squirrels are flat or vertical
No, livers, super livers, like...
- This is only a limited test demonstration
- That's just a demonstration?
I think you should have a look at the whole system we are developing
Pay more if you are interested
I have an interest in...
This is Saito Shoyu
-you must be our newest volunteer
- you are good
This is really great. You're good.
I mean, that whole game was super fun
Good play?
It's good to have fun
It's good to play games
The heart beats faster
- And a smile. - Yeah
Yeah, or... Scream (Harlek's Ghost)
I'd like to make the players jump
frightened
They jump when they get scared
- You'll feel better afterwards. - Yeah
What do you light up for?
This is due to hyperstimulation of suprrenal adenine
- Yeah. - Yeah
But it will be for your sake that the Lord lives
Your deepest fears in the realm of safety
This is the release of fear. It will free you
Yeah, that's right
What we're working on right now is the most personal life horror show in history
It's great to scare you with your own thoughts
Sounds... crazy
Can't wait
- I'm uploading a network packet
- God net road closure..
It may take a little time to figure out what happened in 1990
It's funny. It's a good name
This is the most advanced smart software
It learns quickly and ADAPTS
Monitor your brain activity and try to identify the things that scare you the most and then adjust your experience accordingly
- Are you ready? - ok
- Here we go. Okay, ready to go
- Close your eyes
- The current time is 6:17 p.m
Are uploading
Five, four, three, two, one
How do you feel?
- It feels good
It is normal
Stand up slowly
Are you ready to start the game?
This isn't the house of "Harlek's Ghost"?
This is a portion of the land
In fact, it was the gamekeeper's hut. It was the exact model
According to the game as a copy of the grid, sweep the structure
Not often cool..
What kind of game is this? What am I supposed to do?
You don't have to do anything
Just stay in here alone and see how long you can last until you're scared out of your wits
So I'm just gonna stay in here? You get paid?
I'll take a look in the control room at the back
There are cameras everywhere, no stealing silver tableware
And this
- What is this?
- the intercom
Yes, we can hold the connection for the whole journey
Can I talk to you and you'll hear me?
great
Nothing you see can hurt you
It's all visual and auditory effects of whack-a-Mole
Very good
But if it turns out to be too much we'll let you out at any time
- Stop testing
- Okay, have you thought about keeping the lights dark?
Easy to remember words under pressure?
- How about "stop"?
- Good choice,
Then stop
All right, well, let's just let you enjoy the night
Good -
- You'll hear my voice when you wait
- Make yourself at home in here
- Okay, not too hard
Halek's Ghost
Is it true?
Yeah, I'm really dead.
- library parker
- you are good
- Can you hear me?
- One clear and two clear
Already trying to take courage out of it
- No, those wines don't contain alcohol
- good bad
- We need you to stay awake
- makes sense
This is a really good, bad technique
A stream of carpenters
- So it's right here
- The observation is amazing
There you go
- the death
- What's wrong?
I just forgot I didn't have my phone
I kept looking. I forgot it was in my mouth pocket
There's no TV in here
Welcome to the 19th century without electricity, network and wire network
It's hard to blame them for seeing dirt
It may be all hallucinations
This is the principle of seeing ghosts
The mind can be confused when it is not stimulated by the outer world
The fewer distractions people have the more ghosts they see
That's a good tip
But there are books to read
Still close to the heart
God, I can't remember the last time I read a book
People who think of the past will also take books to read
I know. It's crazy. Why?
-you know, I feel like...
- All right, I'm gonna go over it,
It takes concentration to think
May I say your heart is beating faster?
As it should, because there's a big spider
You see a spider?
- Don't you see?
- didn't have
Don't walk over here.
- to life
- You're a tough guy who's afraid of spiders?
I don't like spiders
The system quickly found out that you have a spider phobia
It's poking at your weakness
It's time to go to hell
This is way more real than whac-a-Mole
It's great. It's real
Well, yes
Okay, that's not scary enough
What's the matter?
It's just... it's nothing... it's like...
No, there's a light on...
Can you pull the tip of the mirror in here?
So you know what I'm talking about
- library parker
- There are now..
There was a man at the window
It's not...
He's out of sight now
There's no one at the window now
This is...
Yes, it is.
It's just the pipes leaking water
I know it
It's the pipe leaking water
To die
The dead
good
You're scaring me.
- What do you see?
- Weird people
No... oh, my God. Oh, my God
He looks just like Josh Peters
-you're Josh Peters.
- what?
You're Josh Peters from high school
My high school friend
The system can dig up some of your personal memories
Was Josh Peters the guy you were afraid of in high school?
He's a bully. I'm not afraid.
I'm not afraid of him, but he's a bully.
God, if I take a few more Israeli close quarters I'll be ready.
I'll be ready for it
The card Lima
I'm going to have some wine
I'll give you a drink but I don't think you can handle it
See you later, Peters
This dry wine is quite good to drink
I'm no expert, but this is good stuff
I've been to France
We live in a vineyard and we have a wine that we offer at the Grape Festival
That wine is really good, I know
You're rambling
- What is this bullshit?
- health talk
Idle talk
Is this a question?
Some people talk more than others when they are afraid
Enough to make up for the fear
- Can also mask fear. - Really?
It's like turning on TV at night
The sound will make you feel more alone
So that you only have one person
You can't scare me, Kitty
What a pity
- Do they have ice boxes?
- There are some snacks in the cupboard
All right, point pawns will point to...
You. All right, all right. Gingerbread cookies
I have a look at
Also good
This one will do
I close the door and he shows up behind me, right?
Yes, that's the rule
Has long been known that
The sudden shock is no longer enough
Damn day!
- What the hell is that?
- What do you see?
There is enough
One...
It's hard to explain
A man with a big face that said that
It's... Peters is in...
It's like a cross between Peters and a spider
Jesus, Kitty, is this your trick or my hallucination?
I think it's your vision
I'm so messed up
Old day, can evil
You deserve to die. You have a bad heart
I'm sorry, but could you say it again?
Hello, Kitty?
Damn it, Kitty.
Just say when you get on the line
You know I'm not afraid, just not talking
Is that you?
Want to trim your ear?
That could be a good idea
The dead
Open it
Do you have a dangerous
Sonia chang ya?
That's more like it
Pretty amazing
There's a whole set of them
I am deeply impressed by my...
You look so real
You look just like her
Shirley harm
I'm just sorry you're not
- Cooper, what are you doing?
- Cooper, you're in danger
-Ann... I need to think
You are so real.
-Cooper, do you...
- Sonya, you're really here
- Are you really in here?
-i'm real. I'm really in here
We must go away
You must listen to me
What are you doing in here?
Do you remember that photo you sent me?
I looked into it. Apparently, Saito filed a patent last year for a computer-brain interaction system
How can you be real? I don't...
Good, but bad.
They brought you here
You're real. They brought you here. They wanted to mess with me.
I understand.
This is part of the test
His exclusive interest was rejected by the court
They said it was crazy and dangerous
Isn't it? How much do they pay you?
Really, because you were so good
Cooper, did they give you something?
I'm sorry. I thought you were fake
But now that I know you're real, I didn't do you any favors
I have some dry wine
Maybe it'll give us a break
Cooper, what I want to do is...
- We'll talk in the kitchen
- library parker
Sonia, just take it easy, okay?
Drop it. You're showing your face. Cut it out
Look, Cooper, it's not over yet
Five people went missing last year
They're all light watchers and they're all logged in with that stupid printer
Isn't it? That's terrible
It doesn't matter what they're doing to you or what they've done to you
It's dangerous. We really should go, Cooper
Well...
-If what you say is true...
- library parker
- Then how did you find me?
- what? How do you know about this?
This is Game Company. I got a location
Isn't it?
No... how did you find me here? This place
I followed you. - You followed me?
- Yeah, use the satellite on your phone
"Find my friend" works...
Sounds like a good idea but they took my phone
And the land was about one and a half kilometers from here
That's the right move, Gaoming
Stop saying that women are smarter than men and "different" is wrong
Look, I'm just saying
You should be able to come up with better stories that are funny, or...
Okay... don't get mad
Have you ever wondered why your bank account was attacked?
What are you doing?
I'll duplicate your card while you're asleep
Okay, put the knife down. What are you doing with it?
I let you get this job by accident
Sonia, will you put that fucking knife down?
It's not funny
You should have called your mother, Cooper
- But you called me and I led you here
- You know what?
- Surface coating path
Put the knife down
Immediately stop
Okay, seriously, put the knife down, Sonia
It's not funny at all
Put the knife down
That's not what I'm talking about
I don't want to play anymore, can I?
The dead
Make what?
- Cooper, what's going on?
What happened just now?
What's the matter?
We've been on the phone all along
- You haven't answered
-you said I wouldn't feel anything
What do you see?
What's in there?
- Oh, no, she's gone
- Who hasn't?
Oh, my God, I can feel it
There's a knife in my arm
- Into my shoulder
-Cooper, who's been there?
- Damn it, Sonia
- who?
Sonya, she's the girl I know the fucking.
She stabbed me
- She's got a knife
- Nothing can hurt you, Cooper
- No, she's a real person
- No, she can't be
She... I got stabbed
I know that
Nothing you see can hurt you or touch you
This is a visual and auditory effect
- No physical sense
- Well, evil is always there
- Cooper, you have to calm down
- I know, because I feel it, you know?
I felt her arm, it was hot and I felt her thrust into my shoulder
- That's not gonna happen. - Oh, my God
- That's impossible, Cooper
-Is there any way...
Physical awareness should not develop
- Except for... - God,
Except what? I don't know.
God can find some ways of replicating the actual body
- But this is a first
- Oh, my God. You know what? End the game
I'm going out. Let me out of the saddle
Stop... Safe and dark
Stop the dead
-All right, let's go over this
To my days
No, I'm getting out of this shit right now
Cooper, do not try to remove it yourself
Automatic extraction is extremely dangerous
Hold your hands. This could get you killed
Keep calm
Is it Saito?
Is it Saito?
What did he say...
We will begin to solve
The good news
We want you to meet us according to the instructions
Rendezvous points?
Too good
Where's the meeting place for the dead?
- Damn it, there's a stairway?
Thanks to Joe
-Just one more floor
- believe me
Top left
- Okay, which door?
- The bottom room
What's the matter?
There's something behind that door. I can feel it
- It's like...
- Like what? Some of one's worst memories
It's like... I don't know, but I can feel it digging into my brain
Cooper, open the door
It must be my mom I don't know. She's dead
- your mother?
- Swing from the davit
- Your mother's not in it
It's not like you can control it
In my head, it all knows.
- it knows
- Does it know what?
He knew I had feelings for my mother
Cooper, I assure you she's not in there
- I'm on my way to the door. - Oh, my God
It's the only way I can get you out of here
Take my advice..
The dead
There is nothing inside that can harm you
But I can't let you out of here until you open the door, Cooper
-Would you please open the door?
-Come on.
All right, I'm in my room
Where is the meeting point?
Rendezvous points?
- There's no meeting point
- what?
I was playing you, Cooper
I just want to see if you're screwed enough by us to do exactly what we say
- Looks like it worked
- No, Kitty, please let me out
Kitty, let me out, please. What the hell?
What are you going to do?
What are you doing to me?
-Why do you want to do this?
- You thought you'd meet your mother
- the death
- What does she look like?
Your mother, can you make her look good?
Her hair color?
Is she tall, short, fat or thin?
Where did you grow up?
Which band do you like best?
What flavor of ice cream do you like best?
What was the name of the girl who stabbed you?
You didn't know any of this, did you?
Don't you find it strange?
- It's taking my memories
- Remolding, technically
- Ugh. - Look at the mirror behind you
Do you know who you are?
Do you know who you think you are?
You'll soon be nothing
You'll be just like your dad
-Shut up.
- Is that what you're afraid of?
- You're stepping in his dust
Shut your mouth..
- You're not going anywhere
-Shut up.
You should have called your mother
She is all you have
- You abandoned her
Get out of my head
You'll never see your mother again
You're not going anywhere. You're forgotten
You should have -- you should have called her horse and gotten out of my head
Cooper, I'm gonna shut it down, okay?
I just need the wire
Where am I?
Who are you?
I can't stop it
I don't know who I am
So I'm going home

They dug deeper than expected
Drill into the brain and plug the entire area I can't stop
I can't get it out. I can't stop it

I don't know who I am
On behalf of the Saito Games team, I'd like to extend our deepest apologies
Who are you?
What did you do to me?

The experience was more intense than expected, Mr. Cooper

Mom?
I must call him
Why is Cooper leaving?
- I...

- I'm right here, Mom
-i have to call Cooper
I must call to make sure he is all right
I must call him.
Are you going to spend the honey month?
I'm looking forward to
That's right. Make it when no one else is around
- We just came to say goodbye
- Yeah. Have fun with your honey moon
- xie xie
-i'd better go to the packing shop
No, I've already packed it
I just can't find your fan your speedo
Fancy your speedo? I'm not a fan of your speedo
I'm gonna go pack my stupid speedo
Good, you're still here
I came to wish you a happy honey month
Xie xie
I also want you to know that I'm suing the father today
What's the matter?
- We know the father is Ross
- How do you know that?
It was his fur coat,
But the day ah
I wish Ross would be the first to know
But as you can see, I'm really relieved
This is awesome. I'm your kid's great-aunt
I know that
I am a aunt
My uncle is
Come on
-you'll all be aunts, aunts and uncles
- Yeah, but only me and the baby
Now that you know, can you help me suggest what I should tell Ross
What are you gonna say?
I'm gonna tell him I want to have a baby
He can do whatever he wants
That sounds right
Yeah, it's just, how am I supposed to start?
I mean, what's my opening day supposed to be?
-Okay, that's great. Thank you
- Good luck. Yeah, see you later
How did that happen?
Looks like I'm telling you it's okay
Rachel is pregnant with Ross's baby
What? I have no idea
Why didn't you tell me?
Why do I say such things?
-i don't think you can keep it secret
I'm the secret keeper
I've always kept the secrets we have
- What's the secret?
- No, Joey
I'm not gonna tell you because I'm a secret handler
- You'll tell me later?
- You already know that
Sending someone off to spend the honey month is really nice
Monica and Chandler are married
Ross and Rachel are going to have a baby
-Maybe you and I should find something to do
- You are right, my love
It's time to die. I left jitta at their house
Can you open the door for me later?
No, I don't have a key and they took my key and said they were going to give it to you
- what?
They took mine so they could give it to you
-Why would they take our key?
Maybe they don't believe us
They let me keep their keys while they were out of town
That time you broke a bottle of tomato sauce and cleaned it up with Monica's guest towel?
-Hey, I washed the towel
- No, that doesn't sound like my style
-i need my jitas
- I have stuff at his house, too
- What?
-Monica's chicken cheese. I gotta get rid of it
Mr. Treeger?
Monica: I have to go to Monica and Chandler's
It's urgent
Gas leak,
Bring in the big garlic bun
-Did Rachel find you?
- No, why?
She was looking for you
Well, I'll see her later
- She really needs to talk to you on the horse
- Yeah, it sounds like something important
What is not?
I think I know what's going on with her
Is it true?
Yeah, we promised we wouldn't tell anyone, but Rachel slept with me about a month ago
The result?
I thought you'd be surprised
I'm sorry... what happened?
We say we only do it once.
I think she might want to get back together with me
I don't think it's like that
- Why? What could it be?
-i don't feel very comfortable
I believe it was just a one-time thing
She looked at me funny at the wedding
She didn't tell you anything?
-Maybe you ate something wrong
-Come on, go talk to Rachel
- ok
Do you know what I realized?
Maybe I'm the kind of guy that women can't forget all night
They'll never get enough of me
I should have remembered that
Under a
-They're kissing. We should go ahead
-Don't worry about them, they love each other deeply and I love you, but I love you in an orderly way
Under a
Hey, can you guys kiss while we're walking?
Sorry, we didn't catch that
We're going to spend the honey moon
Let me have a look
There is still space in the first hold
She bumped them up to first class because they were going to spend the honey moon
- We're going to fake a honey moon
- We're going to spend the honey moon
Touch my ass
- the next one
- I'm sorry, I almost missed you
I'm in love with my new husband
We're going to spend the honey moon
Ready and happy -
-Thank you all right, Mr. Bao, you're at 25 J and Mrs. Bao is at 25 K
We're going to spend the honey moon. Can you upgrade us to first class?
I'm sorry. The first class is full and the couple just took the last two seats
Look at it? If you do what I tell you to do and jump in line with them she'll give us a berth in the first cabin, death
Student: 2, 5, J and K are they just going to go together?
I still can't believe they took my keys and you gave me yours
Then OF course I'll give it back to you.
The guy who wanted to clean the keys cleaned it up
- What was that noise?
Treeger, what are you doing?
- You said there was a gas leak
-Why don't you use the key to open the door?
This apartment could blow up by the time I find the keys to their house
If the apartment I manage is bombed again outsiders will start asking questions
We can do it like this
Look at them go into the lounges in the forecastle
- Do you know what's inside? - I don't know
I don't know. We have to get in
- Act like you're the first passenger in class
- Oh, my God, there are oranges
-it's nice to see you again
-Sir, PLEASE show me your ticket
No problem,
I can't see your seat number
It doesn't matter that I memorized it. It's 1 A
-This is not a first-class ticket. I'm sorry
- It's not tied. It doesn't work
I'm afraid I'll have to ask you to leave
Well run
I think we really need to have a good talk
That's right. Let's go in first
- Look, I know why you're here
- really?
Yeah, well, to give you a little face, I thought maybe I should go first
Ross and Rachel
Rachel and Ross
That's like going on a stilt, isn't it?
What?
I mean, we had a full, full night
But don't you think we'd be better off as friends?
What are you saying?
All right, that's fine
We can do it again if you like
I don't have a question
As a matter of fact, I'm free at the moment.
Do you know? May I speak now?
- Of course
I'm pregnant
ROM. '
ROM. '
All right, I'll tell you when you're ready
You're the father, by the way
- Would you like some water?
- I'm okay.
Ross, don't feel any pressure, okay?
You can do whatever you want
Yeah, I...
I just don't know.
I don't understand how such a thing could happen
B: We use insurance condoms
- I know
But insurance cover to avoid pregnancy can only have 100 points of 97 what?
What? They should be marked on the package
- The package is marked on it
- didn't
They should be marked on the package in big bold letters
-Ross, don't worry about the condom
- I should have known better
Look, you know what? I was scared when I found out I was pregnant
- Scared? I'm not
I'm an angry consumer
- You know what?
We'll talk about it later
-No, I want to do it now
As a matter of fact, I'd like to speak to the chairman of the Insurance Company
Maybe I should come back later... okay
All right, I'll press one
- I checked everywhere. There's no leak
- Can I warm this one up?
I'll help them build a new door anyway
Can you not tell Chandler and Monica about this?
Because they have no children of their own... the door is like their children
I have to install a new lock
They'll find out soon enough
Looks like it's gonna take all day
I have to cancel my yoga class
Please tell Molly I can't make yoga class today
No problem,
- Oh, my God, what happened to the door?
- It's clear, isn't it?
- Is Rachel here
- Didn't you talk about it?
Yeah, but it's...
Look, you know Rachel and I slept together, but there's more
Rachel is pregnant
- My god
- I can't believe it
- She's carrying my child
-i'm hearing it for the first time
- You already know that, right?
- Know something
- Are you all right?
- I'll be fine
I didn't get it right
- What did you say to her?
- Nothing, but I talked a lot to the customer service department at the Insurance company
-i didn't realize she was gone until I turned around
But I just found out that condoms are only 97 percent effective at preventing pregnancy
- what? - I have to go find her
Wait a minute
Are you real?
So with a probability of three out of a hundred, we have no way to generate power.
We should mark the packages
-Well, they did
- what?
- I can't believe we're in here
- Don't be funny
In celebration of your wedding, the restaurant is going to help you get promoted to honey moon suite
No, you ruined us all day
-Who are you? - We are you,
It was only ten seconds late
You have taken the first hold and rest room
We should also get free admission
Not light is you in the honey month
We can let you have our honey moon suite
We don't know where we're going to sleep
We came here to remember our love for this place
We don't need free recruitment. We just want to be together
We need to be admitted free of charge
Monica, it's Joey
Phoebe and I smell gas in your house
- Really?
Joey smelled gas
- What else is new?
- We wanted to take a look, but you took our key
- Think of a way in
-i could knock your door down
-yeah, just do it like that
- You don't blame us for ruining things?
- will not
- Are you banging on the door?
I didn't hear anything
- All right, I'm knocking down the door
He's knocking at the door. He's going to break it down
All right, we're in
-Rachel, are you okay?
- If I was comfortable, would you judge me?
The med horse came in to take your ultrasound
God, I swear if they sell this in a pottery shop.
We need to talk
Now?
I'm in a slightly inelegant position
Berto, I really... I think
I'm sorry about my watch
- No, stay at the end of the bed
- what? I'm sorry I'm crazy,
I only think of myself. I should have thought of you.
- It's okay. Stay on this side of the bed, Rose. - Yeah
I want you to know that I'm here for you, okay?
To do birth checks, take lamaze breathing classes and decorate the baby's apartment
But we can worry about that after we get married
- after marriage?
-yeah, I think we should get married
Is that your solution?
No, that was the right thing to do
Maybe, if we love each other
Ross, we're not in love, are we?
Yeah, but you can't do it alone
What did you say?
- You can't even go to the dining-room by yourself
- what?
If you can't manage to eat alone how can you take care of the children alone?
-i can eat alone
- When have you ever done that?
When someone at the table finishes eating and I don't have time to finish eating
Some people spend two hours just eating a bowl of soup
Berto, you're swallowing like a Wolf
Monica and I grew up together
If we don't eat faster, we won't
Am I bothering you?
No, Dr. Runge, come on in
This is Ross, the baby's father
But I'm not her husband because apparently she can take care of a big boy all by herself
It's nice to meet you,
I'm going to start a search
-Why can't you admit that you want me?
- I need you to stand at the end of the bed
All right, that looks pretty normal
The lines on the silver curtain look like this. This is your son's palace.
Bao Bao is in here
Oh my god
It's in there. I see it
Ready and happy
I'll leave you two alone
- xie xie
Isn't that amazing?
I can't see it
- what?
-i can't see it
But you said you saw it
I knew I was lying
I don't want her to think I'm a terrible parent
I can't even see my own treasure
Lead to
You can see it
Lead to
Here is the
What a beautiful
I saw the
- Really?
- No, I can't see it
Well come on
Do you see that little thing that looks like a flower?
Sweet heart, that's the one
Is that the one?
I saw the
- xie xie
- don't mention it
I couldn't believe it was our child
Yeah, that's our kid
- What did the doctor say?
- Everything is smooth
- very good
- Show them pictures of your baby
I can't see Bao Bao
I couldn't see it either at first
But it's there.
Ross, I can't see again
I saw a man in your freezer
Don't tell anyone
You bet on me at cards?
To I go
There will be no more kisses and no more wedding ceremonies
Have you ever tried letting your hair down?
There have been
Very beautiful
Xie xie
Would you be embarrassed to date me?
G, A, B, and Y would go ballistic if they found out
Oh my god you still love her
In a few months I'll be V I C T O R L A N G too too
I didn't realize I had that much tolerance.
Xie xie
- Did you tell B, R, E, E that you're engaged?
Said -
She's hiking in Switzerland but she sent me a basket of muffins
- Have fun
- no,
It's been rolled 5,000 miles and it's still fresh
I don't know how she did it
Hey, it's time
Let's open the champagne bottle
Wait a minute, wait a minute
You're not gonna embarrass me with an emotional toast, are you?
I won't but S, U, S, A, N wrote a poem
A poem?
She changed the words of her song into her poem
Try the sound
One, two, three
What are you waiting for?
Go open the champagne bottle
good
Xie xie
Hey G a B Y
Hey E d I E!
I finally see V I C T O R
He is so charming
Is he quite right?
I know things are moving a little fast but it's great to have him
So you really love him?
Yeah, I've never been that happy
I'm really excited for you
E d I E Are you all right?
Yes, I'm -- I'm fine
Oh, my dear
Don't worry about finding someone suitable for you soon enough
What do I know?
As a matter of fact, I have already found it
I... I'm crazy about him
Is who?
Oh no, no, no
This night is yours
Oh no no E d I E
Said!
I'd be happy if I knew who made you happy
- Really?
- Of course!
I want to know who gave you that stupid grin
Well, it's actually C A R L O S
Who?
C a r l o s
I'm dating C A R L O S
That's how G A B R I E L E S O L I S got hurt on the night of the engagement party
But she just laughed it off
In fact, G a, B, R, E, L, E, e, e, e, e, e, e, e, e, e, e, e, e, e, e
G r E G must have fallen off the wagon again last week.
The postman stayed at S A R A H's for over an hour
He sent a picture that was more than wrapped up
I can smell whiskey on the breath of A, M, and Y
It's not even noon yet
J O A N N E said she took a religious break but since when does praying make boobs bigger?
What kind of woman hides her husband's body in a freezer?
Ten years in hiding? This is crazy
Has anyone talked to her?
I knocked on the door twice
She ignored me
Oh, I saw her curtain move
I think I can see her hands
Oh, it's true that we knew she was watching us
Why should we be embarrassed?
It's not like we've got a frozen body in the underbelly
right
She even showed you the baby
Oh, my God. I can't believe how many times she pulls ice cream out of that basement
I mean, geez, if you're gonna put your husband on ice, the least you can do is get a freezer
Do you think she killed her husband?
I think it is
Why would you hide the body?
Now she's only been sued for improper body parts
But after the body is unfrozen and examined, I bet they'll find their bellies covered in arsenic frost
What is arsenic frost?
It's just -- it's just a little evil love
Go on playing with your ball go on
I tried to keep it from the kids
Children do not need to know such things
We don't even have to know
Can you give me a minute?
Hey E d I E!
Oh hey G A B Y!
What's the matter?
I've been thinking about it for a while. Do you know how I feel about it?
Do you feel like there are times when people get sick of you?
I don't think you should feel that way
When does it begin? Ever since you started doing things that made other people hate you
What did I do? Oh, I don't know
The first thing that came to my mind was a date with your friend's ex-husband
Oh, oh, so that little smile on your face the other night was fake
Do you mind if I date C A R L O S
E d I E There are tens of thousands of single men in the beauty zone
Why do you have to be with my ex-husband? You're already engaged to someone else!
What are you still thinking about? That is embarrassing!
That's -- that's like I gave the dress to a charity and then you showed up wearing it when I went to the party
Tell me again, what do you see in the ghost after all the stuff you sent?
Listen, E, D, I, E you go find the right guy for you and stop picking up what's left!
Why don't I?
Well, then you're in for it
Oh come on
You're only as tall as my legs
What else can you do?
You'll find out soon enough
Who is it this time?
Um... it's I a N
Do you want to say something to him?
Don't
And he brought flowers. I don't know. It looked like two dozen roses
Oh, yes, I hope those thorns puncture him
Okay, mom, MOM, I know THAT M, I, K, E, and I, A, AND N are all wrong, but -- -
They used me as a card bet
They decided my fate with a hand of five cards
"Wrong" does not mean that bad process
Okay, okay but they're the only two people in the world who know what's wrong with you and find a way to love you
You really don't want either of them?
Is the
I don't need a man
I don't even need to have sex
I didn't have any for the first 16 years of my life.
I haven't been here in 22 years
That must mean something
What?
M, I, K, e are here
Give it up
She ignored you the first ten times
I wouldn't be able to do that now
It really hurts
You have a certain British determination about you
Do you know?
I'm really gonna show you something
I like you better when you're in a bag!
Well, you're lucky I don't have that bag right now
All right, let's do it
Uh, can I bother you?
Guys? Hey, my mom always wanted you two to get away
Don't say that in a soft voice
Let them know that I am real
Oh, because if you -- if you don't go away she'll lose hope all the time
Shout at them!
Why don't you go home and think about what you've done
If you want to go the extra mile, do it yourself!
Here you go - braised duck wontons with mushroom and cream sauce
How do you feel?
I think it's too bad you didn't make one for yourself
Hey, my dear
Hey, I just wanted to say I love you
Are you so sweet?
What's that noise?
Are the children still up?
They don't want to sleep
They thought nothing of it
They're kids and you're dad
Let them go to sleep
I tried to kiss them but they wanted to wait for you
They... they miss their mother
Oh, are you trying to make me feel guilty about coming home earlier?
L, Y, N, E, T, T, E closed half an hour ago
P R E S T O N Don't throw the cloth around!
Oh, I'm so sorry
I can't go back yet
We are, um... doing inventory. It's gonna take a while
That is all right
- As fast as you can? - I will
I love you. See you again
Disk storage?
I know I'm a bad person
I only picked the last one between mother and wonton
I gotta -- I gotta get home
L Y N E T T E You have nothing to feel guilty about
If anyone deserves a break from your daily busywork at the cafeteria, it's you
I was way out of my depth
Give me some more
Some of that, too
You're in here
What are you doing out there?
Some children threw eggs at Mrs M C C L U S K E Y's house
Oh my god
They're not supposed to do that
We should go talk to her
Don't
It's too late
Maybe she doesn't want us to bother her
Come on baby
It's time for bed
We have to be like this - we don't even talk to E, D, I, E anymore
What do you mean, "us"?
I say "we" because she betrayed me and you are my best friends so you should support me and that's what friends should do
"To hold you up" means to lift like chu Zhong?
I can't believe you're not up in arms about this
She dated your ex-husband and M, K, E before she reached out to C, A, R, L, O, S
Yeah, you know who I blame?
I blame K, A, R, L and M, I, K, E
How come no one's mad at them?
I mean, we have to face each other
The men are at large
They are scum!
Okay, it's E, D, I, E.
I'm not sure I'd team up against her
Isn't it?
When you and P a T T Y M O N R O E fought over the back yard fence it was hard for me to stand by your side but I supported you
G, A, B, and y
No one likes to dig up old scores
Don't make me talk about what I did for you again, okay?
I'm not going to fuck fuck fuck fuck fuck fuck fuck fuck fuck fuck fuck fuck fuck fuck fuck fuck fuck
day
Can shedding be a question?
Have her show you later
But good friends are more than just dinner and conversation
They also have enemies in common
Will you support me to the end?
We will support you
We'll be cold to E, D, I, E
No, no, no
It's not cold, it's cool!
I want that bitch shaking with cold
You are good
You are good
Do you still want me to take a look at your reading report?
Dad watched it for me yesterday
You weren't at home yesterday
Oh ok
Now dad's doing everything
Why do you come back so late every day
The restaurant was really busy
I'll get back to dad and trust me as soon as I can
You are lying
What?
You laugh every time you lie
How can you say that?
This is a fact
I came home late because there was so much work to do and there was only one person to do it and I had to go shopping because there was only one person to do it
Go to the top and do your work
good
But that's your job
Hold "sorry"
Oh, hey, no
This is my parking space
The space I parked in here is mine
I waited for the guy to pick his teeth and make three phone calls before I got to this spot
You can't just steal it like that
It's only a parking space!
Don't bother with holmont
Oh my god!
You mean it!
Yeah, that's what I want to do
Crazy bitch
Do you have any idea what you're doing?
What to do
What to do
I want my spot back
Out to
Out to
Hey hey
Apologize to me
Let me go!
Sorry!
Okay, okay, I'm sorry
That I am a reckless, self-destructive hybrid and that I will treat women with respect and kindness!
I'm a reckless self-negating... go on
Don't move!
Is this guy trying to steal your car
This is my car
She tripped me up and grabbed my key
Is that it, lady
All right, you listen to him!
I wonder who you're watching
L, Y, N, E, T, T, I called her twice, but she didn't answer
I don't know what's going on
Maybe she is busy
Yes, the horse is clear
I'm calling her now
Oh my god
What's the matter
She switched off the phone
She pushed me down
Let her have business
No, no, no
G a b r I e L L e S o l I S
She let the big house cool me down
Are you surprised?
I told you what she would do if she found out about us
What?
If she wants to play a girl's game, let her play
For I have formed it
L y n e t t e !
hi! hey
I just called you
Really? The line must have been off the hook
Oh that's ok
Please bring the kids to the birthday party on Saturday
I'll ask the bipod team to bring the snakes and lizards
Oh, the kids will be happy but I have work to do
Oh, that's too bad. I thought you'd pick up food for us
Bring up food?
I'm gonna make pasta and salad for the parents and at least 20 pizzas for the kids
How much?
It's you, kids
If one kid has a pizza party and wants all the other kids
There are good things to be said for life
Well, I could do you a favor
Oh, I knew you'd help me
Uh... love you
I don't care what the court papers say
I don't have any anger questions
I just had a bad day
You threaten to cut someone's head off for a parking spot?
It's been a rough day
S, U, S, A, N There's a reason for losing control like you did
Did the work go smoothly?
The work is very smooth
Why don't you just sign that document and tell the attorney I'm fine
In the home?
It's nice at home
For real, you're wasting time in here
What about feeling alive?
Take away my lunch
I'm gonna be in here for a while
Why don't you press the button when you should die?
P, A, R, K, E, R
I thought it was those little bunnies who rang the doorbell and ran away
What are you trying to say?
I want you to come back and take care of us
New Baum sucks!
You got a new bartender?
Yeah, and she used carrots as a snack for us
It's not good, but it's... it's the way it's always been
No, you have to
All you have to do is tell the big family what happened to your husband and it'll all go back to the way it was
P A R K E R See those women?
No matter what I say nothing can escape her long tongue
I'm sorry, kid, but...
I won't have to wait for it
Can you picture it? !
Look at the two guys you trusted playing puck betting on you
How ugly is that? !
It depends on what Angle you look at it from
Men have been competing for women for ages
I'll admit there's no longer a spear like that but it shows how they feel about you
The question is how do you feel about them?
I told you... wounded, betrayed
How do you feel about them before you ask them?
I'm engaged to I A N, so... It was clear that I loved him
M, I, K, e?
Do you love him, too?
- Is it nearly time?
-S U S A N Okay okay I loved him
I still love him and I love I, A, n
So that means I fell in love with two men
Well, I guess I just found the focal point
Very good
No! Very bad!
This shouldn't have happened!
I only let myself love I, A, N, for for my sake I have lost it to me
Then all of a sudden he wants to reunite with me and now I have no choice
I agree that it's difficult
Let people collapse!
If I choose M, I, K, E then I, A, N will be broken and I, A, N will not deserve this
But how can I say no to him after all I've been through?
So you're gonna walk away from both of them?
You have to make a choice
You got two great guys who are crazy about you
Put away a.. that is life is very normal
Let go of both... that's really...
Enough silly?
That's exactly what you're talking about
That sounds great. Thank you
Hey, would you like something other than spaghetti and pizza?
Do you have such food in stock?
Don't stir
Not mine, my friend A l. He's opening A southern style restaurant.
One night he wanted some dead men to taste the menu
He said I could bring someone
Then.. then.. then.. then do you want me to go with you?
It'll be after we close the door
Don't tell me you don't like southern food and we won't be friends
No, I love it
It's just... it's just a little late for me.
Oh, oh, oh, okay
I just thought it would be fun
Yeah, it's gonna be fun but it's gonna be a little hard on the night
I'm going to cook lunch and check up on my family.
Yeah, yeah
Don't worry
I know the
You were uh you were the first thing that came to mind
You know what? Maybe I should go
Well, it's part of the job to check on the race, right?
Yeah, SURE
It wouldn't be wrong to go and see
I agree with
Hey, kids, go look at those snakes
Can I get you some pizza later?
- See you later. - All right, see you later
- Hey, you want a quick pizza? - be
L y n E T T E!
Are you working in here?
E d I E put me in charge of food
I know I'm a bitch but please don't tell G, A, B, y
Hi S U S a N!
I bought 30 copies of your book
The children can't wait for your autograph
Come on, let's go! Come on, come on!
See we're on the same boat now
Yeah, I just didn't know E-D-I-E was having a party in the park
What if G a B Y see us?
I don't need to worry
I spoke to her this morning and she's going out with V I C T O R all day
Well, that's a relief
On the right
Do you dare to dare not
hi! What are you doing?
"Wu woman"
- Hey, don't mess around! - Why not?
- Because she's not a witch. - How do you know?
No, it's no, it's no, don't be a dick
Who is she, your girl friend? P a r K e r
Close your mouth!
Hey, ghosts! In hand!
P, A, R, K, E, R
Are you all right?
Nothing would have happened if you had told the family what you told me
You can stop them
Hi L Y n E T T E I'm G A B Y
V, I, C, T, O r was dragged to the camera without a resting place
So I'm free for lunch
Do you want to join us?
I connected with S, U, S, A, N but it's weird that she's not at home and her car's still in the driveway and so are you
Where are all the families?
Lay down! Lay down! Lay down!
Ah!
L y N E T T E What's wrong with you?
G, A, B, and y
What? ! Didn't you say she was with V I C T O R? I was wrong
I was wrong. Come on, follow me, follow me
Can I play with you, mama? Not line!
Ride your snake!
Quick point
"Rent out crawlers."
All right, all right, she's walking around the park
Oh, I hope she'll hurry up. I'm afraid of snakes
Oh, yeah, but I'm more afraid of G, A, B, y
Good good
We are almost safe..
What's the matter?
Don't look back
L y n e t t e !
S u s a n !
Hi G a b
Hey, what are you two doing here?
Well, what do we do here?
Oh, E, d, I, E asked me to bring the food
I didn't know she was here
I can't believe you're dead
This is the ultimate betrayal of our friendship
G a B Y She asked me to make 20 pizzas and deliver them to the door and I couldn't say no
Oh, this is a great show
Is our friendship worth 20 pizzas to you?
- We have a three-part contract!
- Oh, come on, G, A, B, Y, be sensible
What you are doing makes us very awkward
- I? You both owe me an apology
- Don't be stupid
I'll leave this party on horseback or you'll come with me right now
- This is the end of our friendship
-   G a b y !
Oh, please. - What are you doing? ! - no!
I mean it!
C a R L O S Stop!
Put me down! What are you doing?
Let me go!
C A R L O S Put me down!
How dare you grab me like that!
You're wrecking your birthday party
What the hell are you doing?
I can't help but be fascinated by their treachery
Come on G a B Y You have no right to be friends with S U S A N and L Y N E T T E
I'm here to tell you what's lame is that you don't have the face to tell me that you and E, D, I, E are dating!
absurd
Oh no
Yes, I found out about it at the engagement party
And I just saw the news of your engagement to V I C T O R on the TV
I didn't count on that
It's just an hour of impulse
So what did you just say?
- You fell in love with that guy?
- Yeah, very much
great
Don't you have love d I E?
We're happy together but we'll never know
So... if I'm on a date and you love someone else and you're ready to get married...
Berto remind me why do you want this mess?
Sorry C a R L O S You really should be sorry
- hey! - hey!
How many omelets would you like to take home
Whatever. I don't want to be seduced
I'd like to bring some... for T.O.M.
Hi, M c C L U S K E Mrs. Y
Would you like some omelet, too?
I thought I came here for the sweet spot
I know you've all been talking about me and I think the only way to get you to shut up is for me to show up
So... who wants to hear some of that scary stuff?
- I think
-Well, if you want to say...
Okay, first of all -- some of you will be upset but I didn't kill G, I, L, B, E, R, T
I was at L A U G H L I N for the weekend when I came home and found him dead in front of the TV
He's got a remote in his hand, God
It was two o 'clock in the morning, and I decided not to call the funeral home until morning
I'll go over to the table and see what's going on
And then I found his retirement plan and guess what?
I am not the beneficiary of his death
-Who's that? - His first old lady
He married that girl just two years after he started his job
We lived together for 3 or 4 years and the white fool did not change the document
Not only have I lost G, I, L, B, E, R, T, I'm going to lose something
So I... um...
You hid him in the freezer and renewed cash checks
Oh, what am I supposed to do?
The feeling that he was by my side for some time was not wrong
Forget about this one... Invert this is true
Ladies can spread this message in four places.... but some people don't need it
Didn't expect me to show up, did you?
Oh, I've called 20 times and you're not supposed to answer... Yeah, I can't
Speaking of that... it's clear... I've been very confused
Finally, I went to see the psych doctor
Actually, that's what the court ordered me to do.
Um... I want to talk to you
Are you quite sure
yeah
I want to marry I a N
I'm sure it's hard for me to make this decision, especially since you remember what we've been through
- Or maybe it's because things have changed. - No
M, I, K, e
At least I have a memory
- Ready to go?
- yes
I told K.I.M. to close for the rest of the day and she was going to lock up
Good -
I'll get my clothes
- good
hi! Do you have a table for seven?
- hey! - hey!
What are you doing here?
The kids are gonna give you a surprise. This is how we eat together. How did you... how did you get here?
I mean, you can't drive a car
I'm a cab driver. I took two painkillers.
- Surprised?
-yeah, a little bit
We all miss you so much
Oh, I miss you too
Hey, grab a big table and I'll have R.I.C.K. fix us some snacks
Hey, wow, you smell good
Oh, it must be mint
It smells good
Hey, K, A, Y, L, A, why don't you go get your sister a high stool?
- Okay. - Okay. Who wants pizza?
Oh, hi. Change of plans
Yeah, I can see that
I'm sorry
But you go...
Oh, no, I'll keep it
I'll make you a nice meal for the whole family
Xie xie
Thank you, sweet girl
You're taking good care of me
When will L y n e t t E come home?
She'll be back as soon as the pizza place closes
Is that R, I, C, K helping her?
In this case, we can give him the wages
I feel like L, Y, N, T, T, T like him
Of course,
He is a good man and a bad worker
No, I mean, she likes him. She likes him.
How can you say that?
Just as far as I can see
All right, later, dad
S U S a N H a I n S W O R T H Too oh my God I love to call you this
Do you want to keep your name?
Because I love that name
Just let me call you "my old lady."
To hand in
Don't you think we'll live in a honey jar?
I mean, it could be so sweet
When people arrive, they throw fruit
Oh, I'm gonna pick this up
Why don't you go upstairs and warm up your bed?
You are so clear that we will be together for the rest of our lives, are we not?
I know that
Hi S U S A N I don't want to bother you
I just have so much more to say
I can't say two words when I see you again
No matter what you are the most beautiful sight in my life and I hope you will have a happy home
See again
Oh I'm M, I, K, E
Hi S U S a N
Um... I don't mean to bother you
I just have so much more to say
Oh, see you again, I can't say two words
No matter what you are the most beautiful scenery in my life
I hope you will have a happy homecoming
See again
Oh I'm M, I, K, E
Where are you going?
Go home... to England
Back to the UK?
What's the matter?
Oh, just...
What am I supposed to do?
Ten minutes ago we were still drawing and you said how happy we were to be together
I... see you took the message from M, K, E
Oh I A N I made a choice
But not from the right cause
You're just trying to honor the promise you made me
It's not like this
I will forget M, I, K, e
You've been forgetting him since THE day I knew you
It's been a little rough, hasn't it?
I love you
I know you love me
But you love him a little more, don't you?
I don't want to feel so far away every time I look at my wife
I'd think you were thinking about him
I'm really sorry
You deserve to be blessed
I am also
See S, U, S, A, n
Hi, M c C L U S K E Mrs. Y
L, Y, n, E, T, T, E well, our new nanny is not doing very well
Want to get back on the responsibility trail?
Are you sure you want me, the Witch of Wisteria Lane, to take care of your children?
My children know you're not a witch
broken
I should have gotten a staff
We miss you
I am also
But I want a raise
Well, I don't have any papers
I just talked to Mrs. M, C, L, U, S, K, E, Y and she's gonna be babysitting for us again
- That's great. - Yeah
And I keep thinking it's time for me to go back to work
- what?
- That's right. I'm done
I should go somewhere
But... the doctor said it would take you months to recover after only six prayers
I'm not gonna grab a bag full of ice cubes. I can just spray cheese on my pizza
And... I don't want you to have to run a restaurant all by yourself
- I don't care. - Really?
For it was said for thee that this work would not be as thy death
Yeah, I said no, I don't want you to go back to work before you get better
You're gonna get hurt again
I'll be careful
The biggest advantage is that you can get rid of R, I, C, and K
R i c k ?   Why do you want to fire him?
I know he's fine, but his salary is clouding our earnings
In fact, he can bring more than his salary
I mean, he's got a pile of shredded noodles from all those new dishes he made for him
Is it true? yeah
I think firing him was a big mistake
Oh, I just wanted to
Well, don't think too much about it
Take a break and get up quick
That's what we need to do
Are you coming home late?
Most likely
There's a big party at ten o 'clock
Therefore..
I only get to see you in the morning
- I'm waiting for you
Good -
Hi I d a
What's the matter?
That stupid postman mixed up my letters with mine again
Oh, poor Mr. H, E, N, L, E, Y his memory is getting worse
Thank you for stopping by
Hey, did you hear about M, I, K, E?
No, what happened to him?
- He moved
- Moved?
What do you mean?
M o n a C L a R K E Stomach panthenic acid Ling can't sleep at two o 'clock in the morning she can see M I K E everything is packed
Well, that doesn't make any sense
M, I, K, E don't just leave without beeping
He did exactly that
According to C, A, R, L, O, S, something bad has happened and M, K, E is going to take a break
I'm sorry to hear that
I always liked him
I wanted to be assistant manager but apparently I had to flirt with Mrs. S C A V O to get the job
He's still going out with E, D, I, E but everyone can see that he's still in love with G, A, B, Y
Are you the old lady from the rumoured closet?
It's not my fault
Scary, isn't it?
Welcome to the Williamsburg Restaurant. My name is M A X, because the hospital won't let my mother pronounce me "Whoo whoo."
I've been out of town this summer. What's new?
Fresh? I'd like to...

Oprah paid Lindsay $0.2 million to get her on the show. Michael Douglas gave oral sex to women and got throat cancer, okay? Just one more excuse for men all over the world not to blow up their women
The situation in Egypt is A mess A M A N D A B Y R N E s It's getting worse. The former child star has been making crazy moves in recent years I'm like my crazy ex-girlfriend
And the Texas misogynist, the Florida police officer who beat a black man to death T R a Y V O N M A R T I N was acquitted
And everyone hates everything except Angelina jolie. - Oh, yeah
I mean, is there anything new on the menu?
I don't know. Let me ask
Hey C a R O L I n E What's new I need to know?
Bao Bao smiled at the queen
I'm talking about what happened at the store
Oh, looks like we're cleaning the fork now? I just ask
Look, ALL IT takes is a quick change of clothes and we go from being fluffy in polyester to being powerful
Just like the superhuman
But superman is at a phone booth instead of a little shop that says "Call me when I'm happy"
Why are you writing if you don't want to?
Because my eyeliner can't write "Call C a R O L I n E"
Look at us wearing our "M A X Handmade cupcake" T-shirts again
Do you see the sign?
Actually, I don't want to measure your ladies 'breasts
Let me shine
Oh, E, A, R, L you're one in a million
Because 9, 9, 9, 9, 9 men will only look at my section
I have to get home
I really miss growing up in Korea
What are you thinking about? Adolescence?
M A X is the first in our country
In my head, I'm still rich and my medic isn't morden Primordial
Who wants to go to the back and see how awesome our all-new omelet place is?
R a c h a e l R a y
We shouldn't get too excited about tonight's opening
The last big one didn't go so well
That's like saying that the people who got close to the nuke weren't in good shape
Ha! Ha!
Girls, I'm so proud of you guys that you fell down and got up
After I couldn't sell my first jazz album
I'm gonna turn my life around and get drunk and get stoned and get laid
I mean, you know, it's a real thing
But why is your omelet shop opening at this time of year?
- It's 2:00 a.m. - We're open from 2:00 to 4:00
Our target consumer group is "after a bar" group
A drunk Williamsburg man
It's the same target group I used when I was alone and the target of my new store
I mean, you know, it's a real thing
We don't expect much from this evening's opening
It's a soft opening (pilot business)
Is there any difference between soft and hard?
You want me to show him?
Thank you for not
Seriously, it doesn't take a minute
No O, L, E, g
Let me make it clear that I'm in a state
Prepare this room and Hua Li has changed
- R, A, C, H, a, E, L, R, a, y again? - Say what you will
H a N Close your eyes before we go in
I want you to take a full body test
Yeah, I tried to trip you up
- She's laughing. - No, she's not
Is I don't have
H, A, N I swear I won't let her trip you
Now close your eyes
- What's wrong? - Now I feel
She wants to hit me
- She didn't. - Yes, I did
Okay, enough with the closed eyes bullshit
Let me see that stinking room in the back
Let me turn off the lights for a little drama
What's the matter? I didn't do anything
Is my
Now he knew what was hard
I can't believe my own eyes
I felt the same way the first time I saw you
Bottles are the ceramic tile of the original is the original tool is also the original
How do you feel O l E G?
Pretty good
"Pretty good"? All you're gonna say is, "Good? "
This place is originally an old rat adventure playground!
They were lining up to bite us
C a R o L I n E Show them the wound
- I don't want it. - Good?
This room smells like a murder field
Or the dung pit of death
Look what we've done! We made it
The coolest, coolest cupcake place I love!
No, you know, it can't be crazy. It's just a trial run
And H, A, N all of this is possible because you let us rent this place for free
Free rent? Let me just remember
When did I ever say "free rent"?
2. At a quarter past four on the seventh
"I don't care about that garbage pile, you can use it for free."
"It's none of my business to burn flat ground."
I knew I'd get bitten in the back if I learned English too late
Has someone knocked at the door already? That's a nice Megabyte M A X
Opening cough up
Look girls, I'm blowing for you
Thank you, S, P, H, I, A but we don't want to be too high-profile. It's just a soft opening
Oh, I love tryout
S o P H I A - Oh, you o L E G
S o P H I A Sorry this is such an awkward meeting
If we had known you would surprise us
- We don't invite O, L, E, G. - Yeah
I was there when you two broke up and I was stuck with the P, T, S, D
"S o P H I E after the wound."
There is no dog blood
The award for the best drama will go to
It's not us, right? O, L, E, G?
Yeah, we're friends now
Girls, I cheated on her so she broke my car window
There are Windows in my apartment
There's your stand up voice and flat panel video
There's my brother's flat-panel TV and his daughter's TV
Yeah, she scared me. She shouldn't have been home at that time
We have recovered, evening friends
Good night my friend
We have O, L, E, g
This one is so cool
Oh, honey, look at the guests
Hey cool guys!
Come and have a bite at my aunt's shop! (S o f t o p e n I n g
It's not even close to what I thought it would be but it's okay
How do you do?
What are they?

In England we call it a fairy cake.
Fairy omelet? damn
Why are handsome guys all g, A, and Y? (f a I r y for gay)
We can have it all
Oh my god!
American Express black card? (Amex's top-end cards say you can buy planes by swiping them.)
I haven't held a black one with these hands in years
I bet you've never shaken a black hand before
Sorry, this is our first day of opening only cash
The man is a real mess
- What are you hooked on? -Not much more than a few minutes
I don't know what I'm on but I'm jealous
Now I'm really jealous
I'm sure he'll be all right
Oh, I bet he'll be fine
And he's gonna be my next boyfriend
R O N D get up, man
He's not breathing anymore
I can't wake him. Call nine, one, one!
Call nine, one, one!
I've seen this all the time
One summer DAY I was working as a lookout for a crowded meth den and he's gonna wake up soon he's dead
Said was wrong
M A X died in front of our store last night the guy was a rock star
He also dated K a T E M O S S
No offense, but isn't dating K, A, T, E, M, O, S, S the same as English law
Everyone has to do it as soon as they turn 21
His name is R O L A N D G L A S S and he made two gold records
I can't believe I've never heard of him
I believe that
You can't listen to a song without listening to the original tape of The Paperboy
Yesterday it was a rolling star and today it's not
I ordered breakfast from this great brunch place at the corner of the street
That breakfast you ordered from The Best latte? M A G n A C u M L a U D e Latin for "excellent" when I walk past that store every day there are only two things on my mind
Number one, I wish I had a gun
Number two, one of these days I have to order the best croissant bun for breakfast delivery
Who knows? I don't know. I smoked too much tonight and then I died
But at least die doing what my mother loved the most
That's right. People only live once
Y O L O   ( Y o u   O n l y   L i v e   O n c e )
The next time you say "Y, O, L, O", you're out of business
Oh, no, it's bad news again
Google alert for M A X handmade cupcakes says you set up a Google alert for our business?
I just set up a Google alert for oprah topless
It doesn't mean it's going to happen but if it does I'll be the first to know
R O L A N D G L A S S died in front of our shop
All right, my cell phone is dead, too
O L E G Why are you still carrying our sign
Doesn't it mean it's already up (h u N G)? I mean I'm big (H u N G)
I can't hang it up right now because there are people in front of your Windows
Is there someone in front of our window?
Is this the place where my family R O L A N D died?
Yeah, it's right there so I have to put the candle right here next to Paddington bear
I found it at his last recital
And picked up (dyed) the rash
Why did you just lie down and die?
He didn't touch it and laugh before he died
With a smile? The younger sister!
M A X come and speak to me
I'm sorry about that shiny hat
Oh, thank you. I found it in a garbage bucket
M a X Are you doing it?
Don't tell me he hit it
We need to get out of this
There's nothing left to do
Three dozen eggcakes, please
You did
There's a bunch of guys coming over tonight. How much for a quiche? 7 pieces of money
Zha so expensive
This is R O L A N D can rest
* Knock on the door of heaven *
He hit it right here before he fell
As he fell down, he looked at me and smiled
Full and quiet
Seven bucks each, cash only
I said can you break the 50?
M a x
What am I to do?
A 5 0
Okay, why? Why?
* Knock on the door of heaven *
1 0 1 0 1 0 1 0 1 0 0
M A X is almost sold out
I'll have to get some more from the kitchen
Good to it

The old fen gives you 30 cents for every dollar it sells
Pity the hell out of it
How much money would we make selling Cannabis?
Do you want in on that one? The old rule of thirds
It doesn't smell like a fucking hippie shit pit
The h-A-N family is mourning for you
Can I be more respectful? Respect for what?
Are you two up to something next? Selling cakes to diabetic kids at children's Hospital?
Do you doubt my sincerity?
I just kicked a bum off the altar of Mourning and he pissed twice
It doesn't matter what I said at 4:15 on the 2nd, 7th
I'd like to take your rent
Oh, dream about it. He's stoned to death
The Emperor tended to us and let him die in front of my window
Life is short and I'm taking it

I'm tired of making money on my own
You have to pay me the rent
In a year?
A month, is there such a convenient place
That's what we swept out, too
Just to show him the teeth marks!
M a X people do not want to
Give me 200 a month whatever you say, I will do it!
- Show him the teeth marks! - Right away!
Got a rat on your ass?
All right, give me one, nine, five
You said that rent-free H, A, and N
This is a matter of life, not personal
Can you make sense of my pain?
Show him the teeth marks on his front!
No no no it's too private
- I'm sorry I sacrificed your life. - It's hard to live
- Don't comfort me
We also put some flowers there is a little heart
Feel good warm
It looks like you didn't steal the flowers
M A X is about love
And wouldn't it save more money to have someone else in the garden?
What about the altar of mourning?
Thou shalt not deceive me!
I don't care what you said
* Knock on the door of heaven *
Can you trust each other?
He made a lot of money
We haven't been invited yet

You can pay $8.95 for your watch

No door, M, A, X this is our altar of mourning
Get the bears out of here
And bring back the altar of the dead?
I will be offered a drink of my own honour
It just died here
M a x do you want to succeed at the end?
If you want, take these limericks away and move them back to our window without rhyme
Because it is our dead man's treasure
That's a little rude of you
"I love you, K, E, V, I, N."
Oh, rhyming gold
Knocked over a candle and lit a small fire
It burns on my shoes
This is gonna be my memorial if I don't put this fire out
Look! Look!
These two aunts have broken the altar of mourning for the dead!
Look! A cockroach escaped from the dining room! Crush it!
Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey
They have disturbed the peace of the dead for their own economic gain!
Hey, that's not good
Yes, yes, yes!
-Bad Ming Ming is him! - yeah! Look at him!
R O L a n d G L A S s died a sad death in front of the window of our lousy omelet shop
See yet? "Sad"? "Bad"?
The rhyme popped out
Hey!
Hey, he knows!
I told him not to pee on the altar in front of our window last night!
Isn't it?
Yeah, that's the bitch
No wrong! No wrong! I'm the bitch!
That's not good
Get him out of here
This is my money bag!
In hand! It's not my purse
Stop!
Stop!
All the casters of the Rolling Generation, stop it! (Tom Cruise's movie in 2012)
Put him down he's not a bad guy
That's what I'm wearing against my brain bag
Say really really want to be successful such as this do not choose hand paragraph?
Just let H A N be torn to shreds?
I'm thinking of
C a r o l i n e
M A X I'm thinking about it
Well, now there's no one knocking at our door
There's a man dead outside and more dead in the back door
I've been thinking about what we did today
Why do we let H A N live?
In?
I brought you some rock star pudding to say thank you
What's in rock star pudding? Medicine pills?
Broken dreams? Tear-soaked underwear?
C a r o l i n e ?
I'm not as talkative as M A X (E A S Y)
That's what all the girls in my seventh grade class said.
See I was wrong
No, H, A, N, I was wrong
We should have paid the rent
I'm not talking about the rent
Rent? Who said anything about the rent?
I shouldn't say it's not personal it's business
M A X to stop those stinking hippies
After they cut me to pieces
I realize that things between us are more personal
A l I t T L e b u s I n e s
A little J.J.? ( a   l i t t l e   b u s i n e s s )
Well, what else would you have?
B e H a r d o n H a n
He won't charge us for the rent
Who said there was no rent charge
I came up with a price that I thought would suit me
- $25,000. - Yeah, that sounds like a good fit
I take it that's what you were aiming for when you first opened your omelet shop
Then we can talk about the rent when you get to that number
H A N That's very kind of you
Oh, I hate to break it to you. She just said, "H a N" (H a R d - o n H a N)
Really, H, A, N. That's very generous of you
But we've had a little bit of a problem with that. Why don't we count you in?
I'm just waiting for the rent. You're my good friends
Finally, a woman was willing to offer her services to H A N and he refused
M a X Google Alerts
O p R A H topless?
M, A, x forget it. It's not gonna happen
Not in your state of mind
Oh, my God, the autopsy shows that R O L a N d G L A S s was choked to death by an M A x homemade paper cupcake
It's too unfortunate
Hey where's your excitement R A C H E L R a Y?
This place is gonna kill me!
It won't be long before those cynical hipsters are lining up at the window yelling, "Have one of those cupcake cupcakes that killed that guy."
Open the window! I'm a new girl!
But we can't expect people to die here every week
I may not be happy but you are too blind to see the sky
Don't need
That's the nice thing about having this window
Who knows what will happen next?
We don't have to go out to get the idea because we are waiting for the idea to come to us in this street
M a X is so full of possibilities
Today it's a black American Express Card and tomorrow it could be...
M a x will not be..
The other time can welcome the wave of han cut small questions
Previously on The Shizu Family
This was my home in the days WHEN I was away
Marcel got everything I ever wanted
I will take it back
I swear to you my loyalty
From this you possess the key to my kingdom
You're gonna leave me for him again
All who loved Niklaus received nothing but pain and death in return
Niklaus she's carrying your child
You have to come with me, Wolf girl
I am now under the protection of the almighty Klaus
It's time for my niece Cami to leave town
Leave New Orleans and forget everything
Do I recognize you
You've been put to sleep
It's all right. I can take your sleep away
For hundreds of years people came to New Orleans from the Louisiana Territory in 1751
A young French socialite, lured here by the promise of marriage to New Orleans's nobility and gentry, looking for a new beginning, hoping for wealth, adventure and even true love
This is the casco girl
They did not know that the man waiting for them was not a noble gentry, nor was he the gentle son of a noble gentleman
Let her out we want to see the woman this time
Come on, come on, come on
We want a woman
Don't be afraid of the lost lamb
The bad boys are gone
We girls hold each other in a knot
All right, is there anything you want to take with you
The story of the Casco girl survives today in a New Orleans style that celebrates fashionable dress and supernatural talent
The annual festival is a reminder of the feminine nature of men who are forced to fight for themselves and the best thing they can do to win
God really hurts
I'm sorry (
It's the only way to dishypnotize Klaus
Believe me I know how much this hurts
You'll be all right to say that you wrote these notes
Don't trust Klaus it's a great way to remember things
Well done
We've been working hard all night
I don't know what has happened to me
I don't know what I'm talking about
But you'll see
I will retrieve for you the memory that was taken and undo the sleep that the blood sucker put you to
And when you do, you'll be able to see the truth and then you'll be free
I can stop if you want
No, don't stop
I want to remember
Do you need a hand
You may be able to use the magic power of the blood sucking ghost
Please let me take care of you
Xie xie
I don't think many Casco girls are pregnant
I think it looks great on you, but I have to.
I knew I had to cover up that weird werewolf birth
I don't think any of the rabble here would dare to harm you knowing that you're under the protection of our family
But it's best to keep it small
Knocked up and with nowhere to go
Tell you what...
If you want to join the festival tonight
I'd be happy to take you out
Things are so bad between you and Klaus right now
I don't think we're gonna have to do this
But when
Elijah
Can you pull the zipper down for me
But when
It's so dull and ugly
Are we talking about clothes or something else
Why are you so insecure
This festival can be said to be because of me
I need the perfect dress leave me alone
- Becca. - Don't touch me
You've made your choice
You're Klaus's best friend again
You've given up the right to touch me
Guess who it was
What's the matter
There are some questions
Our little bird has escaped from the cage
You should begin to feel a sense of relief
Now your little strip of paper can be easier to solve
I guarantee that the whole world will stop chasing me
I'm sure I'll find the mantra for the sun ring
I know you don't need to worry about it now
I remember why I'm going to write this down
I found a photograph from nineteen nineteen
It's got Klaus and Marcel on it
Klaus hypnotized me into dating Marcel so he could spy on him
He told me yesterday before he made me forget anything
I remember now
Let's go on with the sleep before the solution
Get out of New Orleans and forget me
Your brother was sick when he was a boy
There's no meaning left in it
If you're not a detective, you know it
Our secret weapons are gone
She's not gonna leave like that
She knew the witch was looking for her
And her little Tijuana is gone
Mostly of her own free will
What did you say to her in the attic
She stayed in there and lied to me hoping you would help her control her powers
How do we know it wasn't you who took her
I don't know where Davina is why would I run
Will you please stay away from me
Upon my word, I have no wish to see the child come to any harm
She's been through too much of that dog's ass ritual
The girl you're so motherly about is the most powerful witch in New Orleans
If she gets away, how can we stop her from destroying us
If she is not our friend, she is our enemy
This is our friend Klaus
I hope so
You're lucky I know how to get her back
Come with me
You know how Niklaus works
If he feels threatened he will become intolerant
This doesn't look good for Davina
I'm not gonna let anyone hurt her
I will not
Listen, the little witch is gone, right
Apparently he went out the front door
Do you know what happened
I did tell her the long ones were dead
What do you think she was afraid of when those witches tried to sacrifice her
I guess Marcel didn't tell her that the barrier to her freedom had been lifted
So it was you who set her off
I'm just telling the truth
She realized to herself that she was only a weapon they used to control the witch
I was never on the same side as them
You'll see Elijah will join them
And the three of them won't do it
Used by witches tricked by Marcel manipulated by Elijah and threatened by Klaus
She's a modern-day Casco girl
Are you talking about Davina or yourself
Is there any relationship between
We girls must have a camp, no matter what
I'm sorry to have disturbed you
I called you a little while ago
For this reason you will be reassured
You've been acting like this ever since Agnes died
No, but can you blame me
There doesn't seem to be much to do up close
But when you hold on to a bunch of walking men to hide your pain
In four places I observed the deeds of low voices, heard them and heard them
Marcel's day walkers are all over town
Find a girl with brown hair and blue eyes
I think we've known each other before
If Davina wasn't with Marcel he wouldn't know we were doing magic
And if we can find her, we must save her
More and more bloodsuckers the sun seeks in the hills below
I found this in her old room
Well, let's see where she is
Continue to drink
You need vervain in your system so you won't be lulled to sleep again
Cami, do you have blood bags in your fridge
Why would there be? Here
davina
Someone is doing the magic
They were looking for me
Then we must get on our horses
I can't get out of here
Everyone is looking for me
The witch Marcel Cross
My uncle will do something about it
- Cami. - He needs to know this place
- What's going on? - Cami, stop
But he was also put to sleep
He knows that
What are you talking about
He knows that
He was with Marcel
They may be counted as friends
I could hear them talking
He knows what's going on
Don't be
If he knew the witch had bewitched my brother he would have told me
Does he really know
cami
Oh my god
He knew it all along
You guys really should go get on your horses
Take a plane or a train or a car
You'll have my car parked at the yard end
I'll know you're in position
Put your number in Cami's phone
Most of the French quarter is locked down
We must walk without setting the sun
Don't cry
As soon as it gets dark you come and join us
Okay, don't worry about me
Don't let them find you
I know Klaus told you to follow me but do you really have to follow me to the bathroom
Sophie Deveraux on the phone give me two minutes
It's my gynecology doctor
What are you going to do
I know you don't believe me and you need to listen to me
All of them are going to grow and change
Davina has been set free
You did a pretty good job, didn't you
But it's none of my business
I need your help to get the witches through the harvest
Am I sick? Why should I help you witch get more power
You've been casting a spell on me
If we don't finish the harvest we'll lose our powers forever and that's not good for your family
How do you know about my family
You are one of the new Moon Wolves
Marcel had a witch cast a spell to keep them in Wolf shape
Give me one good reason not to hang up
For the witch who cast the spell was my forefather
You help me finish the harvest and I'll help you break the spell
I don't know what I can do
I need to sacrifice the bones of a powerful witch to draw their power
I know of a witch whose body was never found
Her name is Celeste Dubeau
You should have a friend to share
Elijah
It is said that when she died Elijah buried her at a secret location in accordance with her will
I just need you to find the place
There are people everywhere now
Go straight ahead and no one will find you
cami
We need to get off the street
Kieran's gonna call me if he finds anything, okay
You two look so comfortable
No, I just told Elijah we were wasting our time
Don't you like the Festival
Why not
The street market is so hot
Are you here to help us find someone
You can't have your secret weapon fall into the wrong hands, can you
Let it be known that we shall soon find her
That sounds familiar to me, Niklaus
It's clear you're up to something sinister
What is the
Tim west
Can I talk to you for a second
Cami I'm harassing you again
I just want to know where you are so I can meet you before sunrise
You are good
Joshua's most disappointing servant to me
Would you have picked up if I had called you
Klaus, how are you?
Guess what? I moved to Turkey
It's strange the Turks don't eat Turkey.
- That's weird. - You're lying
Marcel and I were just talking about you being exposed as a double agent and we think you're still in town and with someone else
A young, angry witch
No, no, there's no witch in here
But Turkey is delicious
Are you sure you want to leave Davina's true love, Mr. Timothy, alone with me
Josh, what would she think
I just want to talk to her
Tim and I will meet you at the mansion
I do hope she gets home soon
How long do we have to wait to move on
Wait a few minutes
Then I went to see if the shore was safe
Josh, I'm sorry I missed your call
What?
I didn't want to tell you but I know Klaus
He'll kill Tim if Davina doesn't show up
We'll think about what to do
I want you to go to French territory and be careful not to be seen
We will send you a short message as soon as possible
- I'm going to find him. - Davina, wait
I can't let Tim die
What's the matter
The witch
Don't
cami
I was just picking up some clothes
Can you give me two minutes
Celeste fascinates me
Her beauty is flawless
She's dead
When the sun rises I see only the dark night
But I gave her my word that if she died I would bury her far away from a mess of land far away from the witch and the blood sucker and everyone else
I'm sorry, Elijah
Don't hold tight. It's me. Don't lay hands on me
What are you doing in here
You were supposed to hide
Yeah, but so are you
But I'm worried about that "I want to get back" look on your face
Are you sure you want to mess with the most evil man that ever lived
He pissed me off by taking Tim first
I'm going to kill him kill all of them
The original Davina can't be killed
Perhaps
I have infinite strength
I've never felt the way I feel right now
Those forces are building up in me
I'm strong, Josh
If you kill them
What?
If you really want to do it, do it with all your might
Apply all the force you have to them
It's so sweet that you won't tell Davina if she killed Klaus
That you would die with it is too high
The question is if she does go after my brothers she'll be the one who dies
For this this is full of sad feeling color color story to draw a more sad and strong knot
Maybe you'd like to help me out a little bit
Where did Rebecca go
I'm not worried about Rebecca. How do you know Davina's gonna be here
This will make others think that you have forgotten the feeling that you can't pull yourself out of the craziness
She will come
Do you need to be so sentimental, Niklaus
You have a point there
Timothy, could you please play something a little more cheerful
He's a good boy
That's a long time for you to go on a walkabout
Have you seen any of his night walkers
They're not exactly smart people
No matter how to say I finished the life
You two are gonna let me talk to Davina when she gets here
You'll get your chance
You're so sweet
Silence is golden Thank you, Timothy
davina
I have come to send him down
Well, you and I will have to talk about your coming back to us
Remember what I said, Klaus
Let me come davina what's going on
Why did you run away and tell me
I can help you figure that out
How do you threaten my friend's sexual life
Actually, that was my choice and I'm very sorry
Sometimes I overdid it for the show
But it does work
You act like you believe in yourself but the truth is
You're afraid to let anyone see you for what you really are a wild animal
Poultry beast
Why don't you show us your true face
I've had enough of you
Davina you don't have to do this
you
You lied to my face like you were doing me a favor
Listen to me,
You call yourself an expensive man but just like your brother you're a killer
You've been feeding on the blood of the Innocent for 1,000 years
Let's give you a taste of choking to death
As for you
I trusted you
I love you but you only use me to strengthen your power
You don't care about me at all
You are wrong
When you lost to Klaus you gave me to him as a trophy
Perhaps I should plunge you into the boiling liquid of copper
I care about you
I treat you like my own child
I don't think so
Don't tell me you buy that shit
Maybe it's time for us girls to have a little chat
Well, it's pretty impressive that they all deserve it if YOU ask me
Before you pay me back
I have a surprise for you
Josh, what are you doing here
What are you going to do
If I were Klaus, I would
Josh's head snapped off and fed to the nightcrawlers that's what's gonna happen to your friend
But hurting him is a thing only boys like to do
Like how Klaus hypnotized "Fiddler on the Roof," and while I'm fickle, I'm definitely not like my brother
It's okay, Timothy you can get down now
No one's gonna hurt you
He said he wouldn't let me climb down the beam
Well, then don't use a stupid climbing melon
I'm the only one here with a brain. Jump
Davina how did you do it
How did I get here
I'll make it right, I promise
Why are you doing this
It looks to me like you're in charge and you don't know who to trust
I proved to you that you can trust me
Now there's one more thing I want you to see
It won't be long
You can bring your friends
Sophie, I told you everything
You said he buried her between two lovely oak saplings
That was two hundred years ago
They are big trees now
You want to be an all-powerful witch then keep looking
Pray for a little faith
You can do it
All right
Berto, please do me a favor
I'm trying to do the right thing
Don't worry
They're not really dead they're just starving which doesn't make it any better
Do you think my brother Nick is bad
Marcel learned from him
This is how he treats his friends, as he calls them, who betray him
Most of the poor guys in here don't go any further than Josh
Thierry, for example
He was Marcel's most trusted friend
Crowe tricked him into breaking one of Marcel's rules
Marcel knew that, but he sent Thierry
It's a hell of a lot to be locked up in here
Is crazy
Why are you telling me this
Because you need to know who you need to talk to and who you can trust
It's okay
You'll be fine
Drink some water, please
Davina you and I we've both been lied to and used by Marcel and Klaus
May we join hands enough to give them a small report
Each bit
Tim
Klaus forced me to do this
I didn't know what I was doing until I let you
What the hell is wrong with her
Drink water
Tim
Klaus poisoned the water
Tim
davina
Don't
Cami, are you okay
Have you had dinner today
You must have blacked out
Yeah, maybe I was secretly knocked out by three witches
Where's Davina
Does your friend Marcel know she's here
Cami, I can explain
Blood sucking ghost witch
My brother your nephew has been cursed by a witch
How could you keep this from me
It's complicated
There are a lot of things you don't understand
You're hiding the truth from me
You made me believe that Sean was crazy and that I was crazy instead of telling me the truth
I was trying to protect you
You saw what happened to Sean
(please
Stay away from me
You're as bad as every other monster in this town
It was awkward
Rebecca, where are you
I'm with Davina and she's dying because of your betrayal
I tried to get her to stop looking up to Marcel so much but she made it very clear that she's not our friend
I'm sorry if you think she's your friend
Tell me what I can do to save her
The blood of a bloodsucker will not work
Yeah, it's not gonna work
The poison I had Timothy give her was very effective
It's only a matter of time before she dies
It's the two of them you miserable piece of shit
They are still children
We could have bargained with her on equal terms
Those who threaten us need not make trade
Davina's fate was sealed the moment she turned against me
It was her choice, not mine
Don't do that
You know, you can't stop blaming me for this
Do I need to remind you that Davina is stronger than any of us
I did what I had to do
Don't worry Elijah I'm as salvageable as ever
So you manipulated that boy into poisoning Davina without asking Marcel or me
You know what the worst question is
You're too easy to read
I have to make an alliance with your brother who I don't like
It sounds like there's something you want to tell me
You're right
Kieran called me earlier right after Sabine and the other witches did what they did to Davina
How are you?
Let me guess the protective charm
Do you think I'm gonna spend a day doing nothing while I can do magic
They should have done the same
You broke my rules Sabine and I'm guessing your protection spell is a one-time thing
I give you a choice of two things you can do immediately to keep your friends company or you can do the same for one of my witch friends
You have a pretty good idea of who I'm talking about
So when you said you were going to check out the night blood sucker it was working with a witch
Very clever!
I should be proud of myself
I just wanted to
Leave yourself a way out just as Elijah predicted you're starting to show your true colors
But this time you have chosen to ally yourself with a witch who, as I understand, has always been our enemy a member of our family who has threatened and threatened us
Davina is Marcel's family Niklaus and you tried to take her life have you forgotten that
Call Rebecca
Tell her Davina will recover
But the boy is not lucky enough to survive
Tim
Tim, Tim
Tim Tim wake up Wake up
Keep your eyes open No, no, no
Wake up!
Don't leave me alone
She also ok
She was overwhelmed and exhausted
Where is her room
Leave it to me
I come on
Some say that this is the world of men and sometimes it is so
Many casco girls were rescued but that was limited
She's never gonna trust me again
maybe
But you'll never be able to give up and reclaim her trust
But women are more rebellious than the world thinks
What are these paintings
She used to draw things like this in the garret when she was under the spell
These are what she calls evil
And there are some women
Can say that the people who have bullied her had better be careful
Are you surprised to see me
But you tried to control me and let me go
Do you remember the
This is all the work of undoing the controls
It was worth the pain, though
Makes it clear why I want to stay
Oh, and Klaus if you hurt Davina and Josh again I will expose you to the world and you can kiss the French Quarter goodbye forever
A good night
I'm also rebellious and tired of being pushed
For 1,000 years my brother and brother did what they wanted regardless of the consequences
Marcel seems to have acquiesced while Elijah sits by his side foolishly waiting for him to change
Men are so fucked up
What do you want me to do
Marcel can't seem to give up on my brother despite your warnings
They rule this city shoulder to shoulder while you rot in here
I want you to help me take Back New Orleans for them to watch and I have a secret weapon an inside man
She was a rebellious girl herself
Are you ok
I feel much better now
How are you today
A rough
What do these paintings look like
Davina's sketch
I don't know if it's representing something
They seem to foretell what is to come
Seems like a bad omen
Oh, my God, that's not
Hello, Celeste
Come on, Sophie, pick up
My brothers and I are history
The earliest blood sucking ghosts were the Shizu clan
We helped found New Orleans 300 years ago
Now we have returned to the city in the midst of battle
Marcel the vampire leads an army against a group of desperate witches
My brother Klaus was an enemy of both he craved power and wanted to protect the werewolf carrying his child
But Marcel had an advantage when he captured our brother Elijah with the help of a secret weapon
Now I'm trying to save my beloved brother
I have no choice but to support the brother I can't trust
August 1359
I noticed a difference between brothers and sisters
The bond between us grows tighter under the pressure of the blood sucker's life
Once the blood demon is attached to the body, it becomes more and more distant from human nature
My dear sister Rebecca became more and more cold and heartless
The biggest problem, however, is Niklaus
He then with the remnant of patience covered with their own loneliness
Until I firmly believe that I, as their elder brother, will bring them back to the right path to which the power of the family is directed
If I fail our house will sink only in the darkness
I don't believe you before I deal with those blood suckers myself
I know I love a little bit of fire
Should I leave them in the front yard to rot
Again, they are my responsibility
They attacked the helpless little pregnant woman with my child
I'm so moved by your role as a new father to the werewolf carrying your bloody baby
To make me feel something
Wolf girl wants to know what the plan is
That depends on what kind of plan you're talking about
My plan to rule the world or Rebecca's plan to find love in a cruel world
The plan to rescue Elijah you know the good brother
The one you stuck the dagger in the back of your back and found first in the hands of your dead enemy
To be clear, it is from the front
You two said you were gonna get him back
Are there any plans in the works
All right
First of all, Marcel is not my mortal enemy
He was my friend though he didn't realize THAT I was trying to break his grip on the entire realm of transcendental dharma but he was my friend nonetheless
Second, I daggered Elijah to gain Marcel's trust
I'd have known he'd have my brother controlled by a particularly violent teenage sorcerer
I would definitely try to make a slightly different choice number three yes
Point three the plan as you requested is for Niklaus to ask Marcel directly for Elijah
This isn't the whole plan, is it
Thanks to Joe
Klaus may not be a good brother but there is no other bad heart
This is the only plan dear
But there's always a backup plan
What is the backup plan
I look too good in western clothes
Joshua Rosen 1 8-year-old Instant News tourist missing recently came to New Orleans as..
I will stand out as the eyewitness under the coder's hand and prove that he sees
These two drunk guys fell into the Mississippi And they're gonna be under investigation for weeks
No one's going to look close enough
Well, that's good considering one died in a trash bucket behind the county morgue and the other is now a blood sucker
Is there anything else
Please let me kiss you
There's one more thing
I've sent four night blood suckers to check out a werewolf that's been spotted in the French quarter
There was no rest for them after that
That's 10 night blood suckers who died last Monday
Do you think the werewolves are back in here trying to make trouble
I know you and Klaus are friends
But the truth is since the Originals came along shut up, Thierry
You're not still mad at me for giving you a little bite of a poisonous werewolf a few days ago
I blame the kindness that is past
I see you've given him the privilege of free movement in this area
There's nothing wrong with being my family and me
Who lived here and built this place
Come on, don't do that
You both know the rules
Thierry is one of my men
Klaus is my old friend and loyal Lord
And a guest in this house
Is it all right to go with the flat
What do you need a brother for
I think my sister Rebecca insisted that I get Elijah back
She was very angry about it
But when
There'll be three originals walking the town on horseback, won't there
Half of us think his sister killed the night blood sucker
Is that the finger-pointing of an original
Didn't I just say I wanted to live with Ping
to
Take a walk with me
Your lover lacks a sense of silence
He protected me a little bit but he was loyal
I saved his life in the '40s and found him dying of war wounds outside the VA hospital
He would kill for me and die for me
And that boy who plays the trumpet is too good to be true
Maybe see if we can get him to perform at the party tonight
You're gonna be here
How could I have missed the opportunity to recognize the councilman who has received a generous donation from you
He's an idiot but he's doing some community service and he lets us do our own thing
For example, people who don't put our fangs right
Listen to the
I'd love to help you out about your brother but Thierry's right
My men are on tenterhooks
They see the originals back here and vampires dead and it makes them nervous
If I give Elijah back to you now it might give them the wrong impression of who's really in charge here
You know what I mean
You're gonna have to talk to me
Klaus asked Mary Magdalene a simple question for how long
It's taking longer than you thought because the answer didn't work as expected
Marcel's man Thierry is paranoid
He's absolutely right that you killed 10 night blood suckers
I only killed eight people for lying
Should I make Thierry the ninth
Marcel was pretending to be friendly
We can't kill his favorite son or he'll pay us back
- Let's do it. - Yeah
Do you know how to pay the witch
- I think I know. - Good
You take on Sophie Devereux
I'll take responsibility for the next step
I ordered you to drain his blood
What took you so long
I'm sorry I'm not a middle age expert
What did he do to you
It doesn't matter what he did
It's what he's gonna do when we're done it's what I want him to do just like you
With this he pierced his body
This is crazy
I didn't want to do it but I did
This is called spirit control
Blood sucking ghosts can control humans
The originals like me and my brothers and sisters can control blood suckers while no one can control the Originals
Do you understand? Good
That's why a new night blood sucker like you is here taking my orders without anyone noticing
But I'm the one who never ran dry
Yes, young Joshua because I controlled you when there was no vervain in your system
Vervain prevents control
Marcel told all his companions to start drinking vervain when I got back
That's why our friend needs to drain the blood so THAT I can control him to do what I tell him to do
Now my brother is taken prisoner and waiting to be rescued by my camp
We can't be so gentle
I'm glad you could make it
While you're dawdling
Elijah lies rotting with a dagger in his body
You're lucky I'm even here
You want to do it
Hayley was attacked by Marcel's men last night because someone told him they saw a werewolf in the Quarter
She's only been to one place
Whoever saw her sold her
Watch and learn
- Hi, Sophie. - Hi, Kitty
It's full of marigolds and it's very attractive for you
Doubt it
Do you have anything else Yes.
I didn't know it was a peregrine
Why do you want that one
Don't play dumb with me
Rebecca
I sold a few herbs to the werewolf and that's all
Are you lying to me, Kitty
I advise you to answer my questions honestly
Answer her question Kitty please
is
I told someone else but you didn't understand
I love him,
Tell me who your blood-sucking ghost lover is
Do you want me to count back
Quick point
I'm going to build an entire team. A captive servant is not a team
How about
You were right about the renegade
Fortunately, she is only a child and knows nothing about us and our eyes
You want to hear the most exciting thing you've ever heard
Please go ahead
She was in love with one of Marcel's cronies
Guess who is
The left hand has to help the right hand
A correct answer adds two points
Thierry is getting closer and closer to the enemy
That means he somehow became the key to our whole plan
I told you it would cheer you up
In a city where a blood-sucking ghost and a witch face each other, blood - qi fang has just fallen in love
That's too bad
Are you crazy
- No. - It's simple
All we need from you is a small, unusual locator spell to help us find our brother
In this town any sorceress who uses magic will be caught and killed
On this matter
It seems that you have left out an important point in our exchange
Marcel's secret weapon he knows how witches use magic
This tall little girl is very cute and easy to get angry with
davina
Where did you see her
I don't know
That little kid erased my memory right after she threw me out a window with a wish she deserved to die
Let me make it heavier
Davina has Elijah
I'm sure you witches would love to separate Davina from Marcel
We have no idea where she is
That's why we need magic
Davina will feel it
Surely not another witch
Biruin was a traitor
Such as Katie
And at the same time cast a more powerful spell
That will create a cloud of smoke that will hide your little spell from Davina
Katie doesn't deserve to die.
Sophie Devereux
You can't have rules like that
You can't win a war without a tactical loss no matter how regrettable that loss may be
How often blood sucking ghosts are the first to know something they shouldn't know
Your sister was executed in a public square for using magic who knew she would be caught
Did she try to get away
She was caught hiding in the hold of a cargo ship just as it was about to set sail on the Mississippi River
So who is it that you tell me that one of Marcel's most important cronies runs his dock business
Katie's boyfriend Thierry
You're right. He's right
Right? I call him the Music man
The ladies loved him, but he was possessed
He's always around his pretty little witch saying he loves her but I don't know
You don't care that your most important warrior is on friendly terms with your enemy
Of course I care but Thierry is a grown man
He's gonna make his own decisions and I'm gonna gain some valuable insight
And he wouldn't do anything to jeopardize our business
Well, look at a blood-sucking demon Lord holding a lavish and benevolent society
We're a whole body in here that nobody can break
Though?
Well, you wouldn't want those witches to be too bold if one of them said there were werewolves in town
Led to the disappearance of your nocturnal blood sucker
I'm sure you've considered the possibility of a trap
Maybe IT's time I gave you a hint
thierry
Take a team of night blood suckers to the witch's little haunt tonight
Thierry, don't be too polite
So I moved back here to be closer to my brothers
Let's face it, family comes first, Camille
Call me Cami and I need to change this name tag
Drunk people like to talk to me in French
Have you really never been here before
You look familiar
You must have seen me walk outside
Aren't you dating Marcel Gerard
He's a friend of mine, so to speak
I heard he liked blond bartenders back in Rousseau's day
I wouldn't call it a date
I think he's asking me to do it
I don't know
He's very charming
It's a big idea that I should run
I am in a state of separation and closure
That's the worst of all, isn't it
There are some things you can't let go although you won't be on when you are always very clear
I like you, Cami
Most girls like to make sarcastic remarks about other people, which is annoying
thanks
I should go to this lavish charity party that the good family is throwing tonight
He's kind of like Gatsby throwing a mean party
You are interested in?
Little younger sister
Brother brother, I believe I am sure
Marcel's gonna be a little distracted tonight
Should I ask
Let's just say he doesn't care about us
I did the best I could
What are you doing to ensure Elijah's safe return
Now I'm getting ready to insure against heartbreak
What do you mean
We need to give Katie the right motivation to cast a powerful spell tonight
I'm working on a motor
Marcel gave the order to harass the witches
Don't
I went back and made a terrible mistake
What is Ming Bai going to do
No problem,
What's wrong with the outside
Klaus is
He made Marcel think the witch was planning a move against him
Marcel wants us to give him a hint if he thinks I'm favored because I'm in love with a witch
Say it again
I love you, Kitty and everything's gonna be okay I promise
Marcel may not care about all that Thierry stuff
I've been there already
But some SINS were said against him
You can forgive me for that
thierry
Let her go. Get out of here
The one who kills his own mate counts as one
That would be unforgivable
If Katie wants to save her lover from Marcel's punishment and wants to save him
He must bring back his words with magic
What else is love worth paying for life
I have to say that this backscene music is perfect for tonight
What is she doing in here
What better way to distract Marcel than to have his little human girlfriend in a place full of vampires
You're so cute and you're so beautiful
This dance is ridiculous but I think I'll enjoy it
He is the elusive family member with the notorious reputation
Actually, you're talking about brother brother and my sister is right
Yours is really beautiful
And you're wearing the right look
Don't let that fool you, honey
I'm a Wolf in sheep's skin
I'll have some wine while you two talk
- dancing?
- good
Scotch. Thank you.
Did you invite her here to make yourself popular
I think she is very precious
I bet you love her pure heart
Or maybe SOMEDAY I'll kiss it and feed it to you
You look good when you're jealous, Rebecca
The guy Rebecca was talking about
I think it might be Marcel
I wouldn't want to do that
It's been a long time
What I'm thinking is your sister's a bitch
It looks like she invented the word
Listen to the
Excuse me for a moment
cami
The killer ball
It is due for duty
I would have invited you to...
It was just a date
There is no need to explain anything
I'll entertain myself while you do your thing
Why abandon you
Watching you with someone else
Don't even think about it
You're not supposed to be in here
Who are you
No, I didn't mean to scare you
I'm Sabine. We've met
I'm a friend of Sophie's
You're the witch in this house
Sophie asked me to hang out with you while everyone else was hanging out
It's drawn to the child inside you
Half blood sucker, half werewolf
You and Klaus have created something very special
You sound like Elijah
He felt that this boy would make a big, happy home for us to camp, but he was not here now and he had...
I didn't even know that it was.
What is the
Listen I can help you if you want
I mean to help you find out if it's a boy or a girl
I also don't think you can use magic here
It's not sorcery it's just some old playmate who taught me
Come on
You must be a little weird
I thought you said you did community work
Community fundraising
Throw a party and get people to open their wallets for donations
That's what I do for a living
I am probably the one you say is not good but necessary.
What about Rebecca was she one of your donors
She is an old friend
Not too old
She looks younger than ME
You'll be surprised
I met her when I was a child
Stop talking about her
I just want to be with you
You are one hell of a little devil, aren't you
I mean, they're perfect for each other
You want to break Marcel's heart and this is it
I got to go
Lost to accompany
What have you been up to
Not here
Put it somewhere else
I know you think he's a beast
It doesn't matter what I think
Thierry killed another vampire
He broke Marcel's biggest rule
You'll never see him again
What else do we do
"I have"
I want to save my people
Do you want to save Thierry
There is only one way to reach these two orders
Are you ready
Something's going to happen to Marcel
The magic method
I want to hear what you have to say
Marcel, come on
Your edition says
We were throwing POTS and pans
That guy some nocturnal vampire attacked Katie for no reason
His name is Max and I turned him
He doesn't need a cause
She's a witch and he's a blood sucker
Now he's dead
I don't mean it
You broke my most important rule
Hell, we've been friends for 70 years
Is the
I made you immortal
I gave you a gift
I've been loyal to you and I'm loyal to you now
I'm still your friend Marcel
I swear it hasn't changed
You're right about the love
He's got a big spleen, doesn't he
Maybe now I should remember I knew it would be like this
This is what we found in his girlfriend
Are you still my friends
It's funny
Because your little witch has a locked spell in her hand
Marcel I've never seen this before
Close your mouth
I see you're still wearing the sunbeam finger I gave you
Why do you need a recipe for a ring unless you're going to betray me and start a new business with Katie
No, Marcel
Let me teach you what a friend is
Friends don't cheat me and break my rules and steal what's right for me
For the crime of plotting to kill his fellow man
I sentence Thierry Vanchure to be imprisoned in the garden for 100 years
Good play on the stage
Your decision is correct
It's the only way to find Elijah
I just do what I have to do
Don't Katie
Just in time
Quick point
Don't
Are you here to save your own man
Bring it on, little aunt
Go to hell, you son of a bitch
Don't Katie
Things don't go right
Katie's magic has stopped
I can go on
She'll notice if we don't
I can find Davina just give me a little more time
You may risk your life to get your witch back but Haley and the baby will follow you to your death
Elijah will never forgive us and saving him will mean nothing
All tied up and we lost
No, Kitty, no, no, no
Don't
Tell me
She is worth?
I love him,
Seal him up and let him rot in here
How much did Cammy see
She saw only a fight
There's nothing you can't pay for
You really like her, don't you
I'm glad she didn't get dragged into this
It's also a good thing to look at this world with human eyes sometimes
I'm sorry about Thierry
I can tell he's a good friend to you
I made him with one hand
Obviously I shouldn't have trusted him
It's not going to be any better
I owe you for saving my ass tonight
You want your brother back
It's the only thing I can do for you
- -
- Don't even think about it
I know why you're here
You're here to speak up for your friend
You are a good man but you are.
But you've been hurt before and you don't dare try it again
Of this kind
The man I saw tonight is not the man I thought he would be if he could get so angry so easily.
Sounds like a lot more than a broken heart
It seems that someone has rebelled against your faith
Brave bartender Camille
I'm sorry
But I want you to give Marcel another chance
I guess I got the wrong idea
No, you're right but we all have our own parts to play
You went to see Marcel and danced with him
It's hard for you to argue with your friends for him but all you remember is that he's beautiful
This night was a complete failure
It's the exact opposite of that
It was a great night
Are you crazy
Katie died before Sophie could finish the spell
I know very well that I killed Katie
What did you do
There's no reason we're looking for a dead little witch
Not trying to bury Marcel with her
That's why I saved his life
He did what I wanted
Sophie trusted you.
I trusted you over Ben, who was more reliable than me
Wake up, Rebecca
Witches only work for themselves
All they want is this girl Davina and when they have her what do you think the truce will be
Of course not
They'll use Davina's power against all of us
Even if you're right the plan was to find Elijah and you let us down
You always lack faith in me
He trusts me more for protecting Marcel enough to agree to give us Elijah back when the time is right
When he tells me everything about Davina
I'm gonna kiss and control her
I have no doubt that you can make your mind work
You have been so indifferent to the price we and the rest of us pay
You make me sick
Are you okay? I'm worried
Xie xie
I feel what you did
You helped me
It's the old boys, isn't it
Actually, Klaus is the one who saved me tonight
I'm going to right the wrongs and start with the return of his brother
Don't do
What's the matter
davina
- do not line
You said the old crew was in danger
I'm not returning him until I know how to kill them
I thought you might want to know
Elijah is coming back
Ready and happy
I guess there's an upside to being a badass
You can't solve him but you want to read him
Why does my brother always attract respect
He is very kind to me
Sometimes I wonder if my family will ever be redeemed
I know one thing today
I feel like a girl
But every time I want to let go I see a piece of goodness that I can save
You're following me
Maybe it was you who stood in my way
I told you bad Allies like you wouldn't bring a good place
At least I have done something
And you?
Sabine tell them what you saw
It's the werewolf aunt
I feel like a girl
Don't
Etc etc.
What etc.
Please tell me it's not a little Klaus
